NBC News reported Thursday that  Kushner has come under FBI scrutiny in the Russia investigation, with multiple officials telling NBC News that investigators believe Kushner has significant information relevant to their inquiry. That doesn't mean, however, that they suspect him of a crime or intend to charge him.More from NBC News:Germany's Merkel Signals Deepening Rift With U.S. Under TrumpBiden Slams Democrats for Silence on Middle-Class StrugglesSurvivor Recounts 'Nightmare' Shooting That Left 8 Dead in MississippiA source familiar with the thinking inside the White House told NBC News that a few individuals have even suggested to Kushner that he should ""lay low,"" in the aftermath of those reports and new revelations that he sought to set up a secret back-channel with Russia. Separately, a White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told NBC News that at least one staffer was speechless when they learned about reports of a purported Russia back channel.Despite that request, there is no indication that the president shares that view and Kushner remains one of his top advisers. ""Jared is doing a great job for the country,"" the president told  The New York Times Sunday. ""I have total confidence in him. He is respected by virtually everyone and is working on programs that will save our country billions of dollars. In addition to that, and perhaps more importantly, he is a very good person."" The Washington Post reported Friday that Kushner discussed setting up a secure and secret communication channel between the Kremlin and the Trump transition with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The proposal, which hasn't been independently confirmed by NBC News, was made during a meeting in December with Kisylak, also attended by former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, The Post reported.That Kushner is being cautioned to keep a low profile is notable considering his role leading a new White House ""war room"" to deal with Russia-related issues. White House aides told NBC News before the weekend that  Kushner, presidential counselor Steve Bannon and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus would head up the effort, but other officials sounded more skeptical Sunday that Kushner would play a leading and hands-on role.Despite mounting questions, Kushner remains focused on work and eager to cooperate with the investigation, a source familiar with his thinking told NBC News. And Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee,  delivered a similar reminder Sunday, telling NBC News' Chuck Todd that it ""sounds like he's more than glad to talk about all of these things.""Kushner would speak for himself, Corker said he'd been reassured, ""when the time is right.""Although the White House largely  believed Trump's first foreign trip to be a success, that doesn't mean thoughts about shaking things up in the president's inner circle have subsided. Multiple sources told NBC News that changes are still coming in a White House that has become known for its palace intrigue and publicly aired internal politics. Questions have long swirled about White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer's future, with Trump still weighing a higher-profile role for Spicer's deputy, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Officials previewed changes to come in the communications shop, including having more top officials make appearances at briefings.And former campaign aides Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie are back in the president's orbit, sources confirmed to NBC News, with their prospects of officially joining the administration swirling as Trump seeks out the team that brought him success during the campaign.That campaign spirit could be back in full view in the coming weeks, as well, with one official telling NBC News that Trump is expected to get back on the road and to the rallies he so loves, using them to bolster his agenda on key issues like tax reform and health care.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/29/kushner-was-asked-to-lay-low-after-russia-related-reports-source-says.html

When risks materialize, as they sometimes do when those who borrow get into difficulties, NPLs must rise,"" Ravi Menon, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said in his opening remarks at the 2017 Symposium on Asian Banking and Finance in the city state.""This may be odd for a regulator to say, but if NPLs did not rise at all during difficult times, then the banks are probably not lending enough, they're not taking on sufficient risks to promote business expansion or enterprise,"" he added.Bad loans have risen at Asian banks but they are better placed for growth compared to their European counterpart, according to Singapore's central bank chiefZhang Peng | LightRocket  | Getty ImagesA Reuters data analysis last year found bad loans at 74 major listed Asian banks, excluding Indian and Japanese lenders, reached $171 billion at the end of 2015. That was the highest since 2008 and 28 percent higher than a year earlier. Concerns over mounting debt levels in Asia have resulted in several changes in the region, including a recent downgrade in China's rating by Moody's.Rising levels of bad loans, coupled with weaker economic growth and prolonged easy monetary policy, have also affected returns by Asian banks, Menon noted.But Asian banks are in a better position to grow compared to their European counterparts, some of which have withdrawn from the region by selling their Asian business units, Menon said. He noted that Asia's growth is expected to average around 6 percent in the next five years, compared to the global average of 3.7 percent.On bad debt, he said, it is more important that banks manage that risk by ""proactively and conservatively"" setting aside enough money to cover those loans.""Take for example Singapore. NPLs have risen amidst the weakening environment and emerging asset quality risks in the oil and gas sector, which has been weighed down by low oil prices\xe2\x80\xa6 Banks in Singapore have made adequate provisions. The overall provisioning cover for the banking system, as a percentage of total unsecured NPLs, is about 100 percent.

6,Israel\xe2\x80\x99s resilient economy can use a tune-up,Investing in: Israel,29-05-2017,"Mahmoud Illean | Corbis | Getty ImagesA report on the socioeconomic situation in Israel published on Sunday has underlined the two faces of the country's economy. The successful high-tech industry and some other sectors remain attractive to investors but underlying issues, including persistent high poverty levels and inequality may, if not addressed, negatively affect economic growth, which stood at a healthy 4 percent in 2016.""We had good growth in Israel the last year but we think that was an outlier and we don't necessarily think that will continue in the near future unless steps are taken,"" cautioned Avi Weiss, director of Jerusalem's Taub Center for Social Policy Studies and editor of its 'A Picture of the Nation' report.Some of the report's findings chime with what others have been saying about the Israeli socioeconomic situation. Notably, Paul Donovan, UBS Wealth Management chief economist, was earlier this month reported by Reuters to have said that the country risks stoking anti-establishment resentment if other sectors of the economy continue to lag behind the high-tech sector, also in terms of wages, thus contributing to a growing gap between rich and poor.The Taub Center report yields some surprising conclusions. While GDP growth has been very robust for an advanced economy, GDP growth per capita shows a different picture. Israel has remained consistently in the bottom half of advanced economies in recent years when it comes to GDP per capita and is in danger of being overtaken by better performing countries.Productivity too, often held up as a shining example of Israel's economic performance, has seen relative low growth in recent years. As with most metrics, that's not true for the high-tech industry. But, says Weiss: ""There's only eight percent of the working population that works in the high-tech industry. That mean 92 percent don't. And those 92 percent have on average low labor productivity.""Weiss, a former chief economist at Israel's antitrust authority, recommends government support for innovation in traditional industries by offering tax breaks to investors and targeting training programs at those sectors.He stressed that he's not painting a gloomy picture. In fact, the government has been doing more in the field of education and poverty reduction over the last few years. There's much room for improvement that's attainable, such as in raising educational levels among Israel's large Arab and ultra-orthodox populations that still lag behind.The report says that one of its purposes is to consider ""sources of future growth"". Weiss adds: ""There are lots of places where you can see growth coming from.""Ease of doing business can also be improved, Israel is consistently ranked below most other OECD countries in the World Bank's annual report. Yaniv Pagot, economist and chief investment strategist at Israel's Ayalon Group acknowledges: ""People invest here despite the fact that the ease of doing business is not great.""Investors come to Israel for added value and know-how, says Pagot. They tend to look at the glass half full, rather than half empty. ""Investors look first and foremost at the strong growth relative to other developed countries.""Steven Schoenfeld, founder and chief investment officer at New York-based BlueStar Global Investors concurs. He's very upbeat about the performance of Israel's economy: ""Investors around the world are looking for growth, and growth with stability is a very rare commodity.""He says that since Israel was upgraded from an emerging to a developed economy at the London and New York stock exchanges at the end of the previous decade, even Israeli high-tech companies have been underrepresented in global indices. This leaves a lot of opportunity for investors, not only in high-tech but also in sectors such as retail, real estate and others associated with consumer spending.As in most other advanced economies at the moment, growth in Israel is being driven by consumer spending. Ayalon's Pagot believes that this will continue, despite the challenges of wage gaps and inequality.""We see strong growth of private consumption, low inflation, a positive investors' climate because of low interest rates, year after year of falling external debt, we see responsible fiscal policies and fiscal goals being met,"" says Pagot. There is a lot of confidence in Israel's economy, he says: ""You see that in the way the ratings agencies look at the local economy.""Indeed, agencies such as Moody's keep Israel consistently in the A+ ranking and focus on the country's economic ""resilience"", i.e. its ability to overcome shocks to its economy stemming from its often turbulent geopolitical and domestic political situations.Israel's natural gas finds and the beginning of exploitation of its Tamar field in 2013 have also had a positive impact on the economy, although that has largely been absorbed by now, according to analysts. Getting the larger Leviathan field ready and starting exports from it, is expected to give a new boost to the economy.All in all, Pagot estimates that in the coming years, absent any ""spanners in the works"" in terms of the geopolitical situation, GDP growth of 3 percent to 3.5 percent should be possible: ""As for the economic fundamentals, that's a goal that's attainable.""Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

7,"Woods apologizes for DUI arrest, blames medication",U.S. News,29-05-2017,"Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office Former world number one golfer Tiger Woods said an unexpected reaction to prescribed medications was to blame for his early-morning DUI arrest near his Jupiter Island home in Florida on Monday.Woods, who underwent surgery last week to relieve lingering back pain, was booked at 7:18 a.m. (1118 GMT) and released several hours later on his own recognizance, Palm Beach County Police said in an online report.Woods said in a statement released by his spokesman that alcohol was not a factor in his arrest but apologized and added that he took full responsibility.""I want the public to know that alcohol was not involved,"" he said.""What happened was an unexpected reaction to prescribed medications. I didn't realize the mix of medications had affected me so strongly.""I would like to apologize with all my heart to my family, friends and the fans. I expect more from myself, too.""Woods, who is second on the all-time list with 14 major titles, said he cooperated with police and wanted to thank the Jupiter Police Department and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's office for their professionalism.""I will do everything in my power to ensure this never happens again,"" he added.The incident occurred less than a week after Woods expressed optimism about his future following back surgery, saying on his website that he experienced ""instant relief"" and had not ""felt this good in years.""Woods has previously made headlines away from the golf course. His private life unraveled in late 2009 over allegations about affairs with several women and ultimately led to the end of his marriage.Those allegations followed a bizarre early morning car accident outside his Florida home that rapidly ballooned into a fully-fledged sex scandal which turned his previously unblemished life and career upside down.The scandal ultimately cost Woods a number of lucrative endorsement deals, while other sponsors shifted away from using him in marketing but did not end their contracts with him.Woods, whose current sponsors include Nike, Bridgestone, Hero, Kowa, Upper Deck, and Monster Energy was ranked 12th on Forbes' list of the highest-paid athletes in 2016, with total earnings of $45.3 million, despite missing much of the year recovering from back surgery.A 79-time winner on the PGA Tour who was world number one for a record 683 weeks, Woods lost form in recent years due to injuries and the mastering of a new swing while his ranking has plummeted to 876 after his long spell on the sidelines.He has competed in only 19 events on the PGA Tour since the end of 2013, recording just one top-10 during that period along with seven missed cuts and three withdrawals.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/29/tiger-woods-arrested-in-florida-for-suspicion-of-drunk-driving.html

Trading was subdued due to public holidays in China, the United States and Britain, but concerns lingered over whether OPEC action would be enough to stem the tide of oversupply.Brent crude futures were trading down 19 cents at $51.96 per barrel at 0857 GMT.

OPEC's success in drawing down inventories may hinge on output in the United States, which is not participating in the cuts. U.S. production has soared 10 percent since mid-2016 to more than 9.3 million bpd, close to top producer levels Russia and Saudi Arabia.U.S. drillers have added rigs for 19 straight weeks, bringing the total 722, the highest number since April 2015 and the longest run of additions on record, according to energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc.Almost all of the recent U.S. output increases have been onshore, from so-called shale oil fields.Even if the rig count did not rise further, Goldman Sachs said it estimated U.S. output would increase by 785,000 bpd between the fourth quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2017 across the Permian, Eagle Ford, Bakken and Niobrara shale plays.Analysts say that reducing bloated global stocks will be key to reining in oversupply.""It's going to be all about inventories and whether they fall as much as OPEC thinks,"" said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/28/oil-prices-stay-weak-as-us-drilling-undermines-drive-to-tighten-markets.html
9,San Francisco Fed's Williams: US economy doesn't need a fiscal package,Federal Reserve,28-05-2017,"John Williams, Federal Reserve Bank of San FranciscoGetty ImagesSan Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John C. Williams said on Monday in Singapore that the U.S. economy was performing well and didn't need a fiscal package to get on track.""It's not like we need fiscal policy in the short run to help the economy get back on track. We're actually in a good place in terms of where the economy is even without thinking about fiscal stimulus,"" Williams said on the sidelines of the Symposium on Asian Banking and Finance. U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth rose 1.2 percent annualized in the first quarter, according to updated data, faster than the 0.7 percent preliminary estimate released last month. The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent in April. Noting the Fed's dual mandate, or twin goals, of maximum employment and price stability, the text of his speech at the symposium read, ""the U.S. economy is about as close to the Fed's dual mandate goals as we've ever been."" But in his remarks prior to the speech, he also pointed to uncertainty over what form the Trump administration's fiscal policies might take.""There's a lot of uncertainty about fiscal policy. I'm not sure what's going to happen in terms of tax policy, spending policy, healthcare reform, trade immigration, all those policies. There's not a lot of clarity around that,"" he said, noting the Fed was studying various scenarios.Williams, who is currently a non-voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, pointed to four big policies with the potential for dramatic impact on the U.S. economic outlook, both in the short and long term: Tax reforms, health care, immigration and trade, including the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).""Right now, looking at what are the more likely scenarios, I don't see any of them having a big effect on growth in the next few years. Maybe there are some scenarios that are slightly positive, and what I mean by slightly, pushing up U.S. GDP growth by a tenth of a percent or a couple of tenths of a percent,"" he said. He added that he saw ""a little net positive due to the tax cuts,"" but he had some words of caution. ""I think a lot of people, maybe stock market investors and others, have counted up all the positives and kind of ignored how do you pay for that and the negatives. I think there may be some excessive optimism in the U.S. around how this will affect the economy,"" he said.Williams also pointed to potentially negative scenarios, particularly if spending were to be cut dramatically in the short term.He said that if the proposed changes to the Affordable Care Act were passed, ""that could have a short-run significant negative impact in terms of spending.""  Williams reiterated that he still believed a total of three rate hikes by the central bank this year, including the one in March, were appropriate.""Unemployment is at 4 percent. We're adding 180,000 jobs a month, That's roughly twice as much as the U.S. economy needs in a sustainable way. My worry there is if we keep that going, in another couple of years, unemployment will go down in the 3 percents, below 4 percent, and inflationary pressures will build,"" he said. Even with interest-rate increases and normalization of the balance sheet, Williams said he expected economic growth of slightly below 2 percent.On a longer term view, Williams pointed to other challenges for the U.S. economy. ""I personally view that the biggest challenges the U.S. faces are really longer run challenges, not about next month, next year. They're about the fact that productivity growth is very slow, we have a shortfall of infrastructure in the U.S.,"" he said.""We have a lot of longer term challenges that really revolve around needing more investments in education, job training, infrastructure, research and development, all the things that propel an economy over the longer term."" Williams also said he was concerned about the move away from globalization.""Globalization and trade have been hugely beneficial to people around the planet,"" he said. ""I agree that we need to figure out ways to create more modern approaches to that, but what worries me is if countries around the world pull back from integration and trade, I think that would be pretty negative, not only for the global economy, but for the U.S. economy.""On China, Williams said he wasn't worried about a hard-landing for the mainland's economy, at least for the next few years as policymakers were unlikely to allow sharp moves amid a leadership decision this year.But he added that he was more concerned about the five-year view for China, noting that the short-term economic fixes were creating a high debt load.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/28/san-francisco-feds-williams-reiterates-his-expectation-of-three-rate-hikes-this-year-including-march.html

The 1,009 people polled in mid-May did better than last year's group, which had just 28 percent who understood what these state-sponsored plans did. These 529 plans offer many tax benefits that are better than using a savings account or, worse, tapping your retirement savings. Investment earnings in a 529 plan are not subject to federal capital gains tax and generally not taxed by state governments when used for qualified education expenses, such as tuition, fees, books, and room and board, of the designated beneficiary.The most important thing is to start saving and not wait for a rainy day.Andrea Feirsteinfounder, AKF Consulting GroupIn addition, 33 states and the District of Columbia sweeten the deal by giving residents a tax break if they invest in their state's 529 plan.

""It's a relatively new product, started in 1996, and awareness is slowly growing among parents and grandparents.""Beyond the tax benefits, investors should know about the two types of 529 college savings plans: those sold directly by the states and those sold through financial advisors. (To make matters more confusing, there are also 529 prepaid plans that allow account holders to buy tomorrow's tuition at today's prices at in-state public colleges and certain private schools.)Direct-sold 529 plans generally have lower investment fees than advisor-sold ones. However, advisor-sold plans tend to offer more investment options than direct-sold plans. ""Fees matter, and we are seeing fees continue to come down for direct-sold 529 plans,"" Feirstein said.Roughly 60 percent of assets invested in 529 plans are in age-based portfolios, which automatically increase their bond holdings to become more conservative as your child reaches college age.The 2K ruleFidelity Investments recommends 529 plan investors use the $2,000 rule.Here's how it works: Multiply your child's age by $2,000 to stay on track to cover half the average cost of a four-year, public university. Under this strategy, if you have a 5-year-old, you would need to have $10,000, or $2,000 times 5 years, to be ""reasonably confident"" that you can afford roughly half of the cost of four-year, in-state public university.More from College Game Plan:Three ways to avoid the financial death spiral of defaulting on your student loans The 3-minute tool to calculate your actual college costs What JPMorgan CEO Dimon gets wrong about the student debt crisis529 plan investors come close to Fidelity's 2K rule.

A decade ago, about 29 percent of 529 plan investors had beneficiaries who were 1 year old or younger. Now about 36 percent of 529 plan accounts have beneficiaries in this age group.""Too many people see the cost of college and have a real mental block that they are never going to be able to save enough, so they don't even start,"" Creonte said.

The iShares Russell 2000 ETF saw $1.8 billion worth of redemptions in the week ended May 24th, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper. That made the small-cap tracking ETF the most heavily redeemed in the week, ahead of the much larger SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY). Small-cap stocks ""may have had gains late last year in the expectation of benefits of Trump's campaign promises. Those expectations are now waning, along with investors moving out of the asset class,"" Erin Gibbs, S&P Global portfolio manager, wrote Friday in an email to CNBC. The index initially surged after the U.S. election in November, rising 16 percent in a month as investors anticipated economic growth and broad corporate tax cuts under the Trump administration that would benefit companies that have mostly domestic revenues. Expectations for an economic stimulus and protectionist trade policies under the new administration buoyed the Russell 2000, which has stocks that are more domestically focused than does the S&P 500. But with the Trump agenda appearing to founder, the small caps have been left at an inflated valuation compared with their large-cap peers. Gibbs is also keeping an eye on the Fed. Small companies hold a higher percentage of debt than large ones, which means they run into trouble in periods of fiscal tightening, Gibbs wrote. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise its federal funds target rate again in June. Meanwhile, the lag in small caps appears to be a bit of a warning sign for the larger stocks, said Bill Baruch, iiTrader senior market strategist.""I don't like to see lagging in the small caps, and I think that can start to signal that the market itself is a little frothy,"" Baruch said Friday on CNBC's ""Power Lunch.""

Southwest Airlines is up 21 percent on strong execution. Railroad Kansas City Southern and the embattled United Continental were the only other double-digit gainers.The rest of the group lagged. Most of the airlines offered minor gains of 3 or 4 percent, while truck, freight, and logistics companies like J.B. Hunt and Ryder were down, some with double-digit losses.""I find the action in this group disturbing,"" Cramer said. ""You remove CSX and Norfolk Southern and Southwest and you've got a group that confirms the bond market's advance, meaning interest rates going down, and not the stock market's rally \xe2\x80\x94 stocks going up. There are just too many negatives, with a total of eight down for the year. It's not a group that you want to own.""And while it can be uplifting to tinker with the group, replacing Ryder with competitor XPO Logistics for a 30-percent boost or removing rental car player Avis with its 40 percent downturn, Cramer says the index offers clarity more than anything else.""History teaches us that you can't look through an index like that, and the only conclusion right now is that the Dow Jones Transportation index offers no solace for the bulls and without a re-acceleration, makes you feel that the rally isn't being confirmed by a group that I have always thought has to be appeased if we're going to get another leg up from here,"" he said.Questions for Cramer?

The organization, which will go public on Tuesday, will provide money, guidance, and political connections for the candidates it chooses to run under its banner.Democrats experiencing a surge of grassroots activism in the wake of Donald Trump's election have struggled to translate that energy into clear victories. The party improved its performance but has still fallen short of winning three straight special elections in Kansas, Georgia (which goes into a runoff in June), and Montana. Republicans have commanded a solid majority of the House since 2010.More from Vox: Why you can't blame mass incarceration on the war on drugs Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and the fight to find the antidote to TrumpismThe Marine Corps has a 'toxic masculinity' problemOne potential problem identified by some political analysts is the ability of Republicans to run attack ads tying Democrats to the party's coastal and culturally liberal wing.It's hard to convince people around here sometimes how toxic our brand is. But, clearly the brand is damaged, and we need to see if something else can work.Rep. Tim RyanD-OHBall and the House Democrats behind the People's House Project say they're determined to shake that image. They'll try to fundraise for the PAC's candidates, recruit candidates that fit the bill, and give them a slogan to use to try to distinguish themselves from the national party. ""It will allow them to say, 'I'm a different kind of Democrat,'"" said Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH), one of the House Democrats backing the project, in an interview. ""It's hard to convince people around here sometimes how toxic our brand is. But, clearly the brand is damaged, and we need to see if something else can work.""Trying to fix the Democratic Party's ""heartland"" image problemSo far, three House Democrats from the two regions targeted by the PAC \xe2\x80\x94 Ryan, Michigan's Dan Kildee, and Kentucky's John Yarmuth \xe2\x80\x94 are supporting the People's House Project.The two House Democrats interviewed for this story emphasized that they view the project as complementary, rather than in conflict with, the existing Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Similarly, they stressed that they don't intend for the new organization to serve as a rebuke to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. (Ryan ran against Pelosi for minority leader in December 2016 and lost.) ""This has to be a movement with a lot of hands rolling in the same direction,"" Kildee said in an interview.The historical steel mill town of Braddock was once a thriving center of America's steel industry but once the mills closed, it suffered severe economic decline and depopulation.Andrew Lichtenstein | Corbis | Getty ImagesBut Ball was more willing to directly attack the Democratic Party's leadership in the House \xe2\x80\x94 and cast the new effort as an attempt to break with it. Some political analysts say Democratic candidates are weighed down by what the Cook Political Report calls the ""Pelosi Factor."" In the home stretch of several House elections, including Thursday's Montana race, Republicans have deployed images of Pelosi in attack ads to go after their Democratic opponents.""She's an impediment to every House Democrat in the country except for a few coastal enclaves,"" Ball said in an interview. Candidates running under the People's House Project will be able to say they're of a different cast than Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Ball said.""This gives us a chance to go straight into the heartland with an economic message,"" said Kildee, who like Ryan stressed that he doesn't view the effort as contradictory to Pelosi. ""We have really not led with an economic message that transcends the whole spectrum of voters who would benefit from Democratic policies.""But will the plan actually work?Despite the lofty ambitions of the project, it's far less clear if the new organization will have the clout or resources to fix Democrats' image problem in Appalachia and the Rust Belt \xe2\x80\x94 two regions Hillary Clinton lost badly to Trump this fall.Ball said the PAC would help by giving a boost to candidates who may not have the financing needed to draw help from national Democrats, but would ultimately prove more popular in a general election if they could only capture the nomination.""The way you run now is based on your connection on the donor class \xe2\x80\x94 that's how you're evaluated. We have become beholden to not only the donor class but also the consultant-industrial complex,"" Ball said, citing her own experience as a Democratic House candidate and the need to raise six-figure sums for television ad buys.What suggests the new effort will be able to raise enough money to beat candidates tied to the donor class? On that front, Ball was less clear. She said it was too early to talk about the new PAC's fundraising apparatus. She declined to mention how it would reinvent traditional grassroots funding approaches.And this isn't the only new political group vying to field a new brand of Democratic candidate. Like the People's House Project, a new group called the Justice Democrats is looking to run candidates who are economically populist and left-wing.But Ball is optimistic.

""For domestic price pressures to strengthen, we still need very accommodative financing conditions, which are themselves dependent on a fairly substantial amount of monetary accommodation,"" he said, according to Reuters.Mario DraghiAlex Kraus | Bloomberg via Getty ImagesHis words, intended to temper expectations of any policy move by the central bank in June, weighed on the  and seen European bond yields tick higher. The common currency earlier on Tuesday hit a more than one-week low of $1.111 against the dollar, although has since recovered to around $1.117.

For those inundated with offers, it can be hard to tell the good from the bad.Over the past few years, card issuers have  upped the ante with better rewards and sign-up bonuses to attract customers.However, rewards cards, which dole out points when you make purchases at airlines, gas stations and restaurants, generally have higher-than-average interest rates to compensate issuers for the additional perks. So for starters, the benefits of using a fancy card are quickly negated if you carry a monthly balance. And depending on how much you spend each month, signup bonuses and other rewards don't always offset the cost of an annual fee, which can be as much as $450 depending on the card, according to WalletHub's 2017 Credit Card Rewards Report.

Often these cards have better initial bonuses and higher earning rates than cards without a fee.)For big spenders, it is easier to rack up enough charges to reap the benefits of a rewards card and offset the fee.On the other hand, if you don't spend that much each month, then most of these cards do not make sense, according to Roman Shetyn, CEO and co-founder of reward-comparison site RewardExpert. On average, it can take most of the year for cardholders to break even.""If you're only charging a couple hundred dollars to your card per month, a high-fee luxury card is probably not the best bet for you as it'll likely take a year or more for you to start netting rewards,"" Shetyn said.VIDEO1:0301:03NerdWallet\xe2\x80\x99s best travel credit cards of 2017Your Money's WorthWith so many rewards cards to choose from, and conditions to watch out for, the best credit card isn't always so obvious.

Very bad for U.S. This will changeThe comments made on Twitter take current tensions in U.S.-German relations a notch\xc2\xa0higher.Chancellor Angela Merkel said at an election rally on Sunday that Germany and the European Union can no longer rely on the United States.\xc2\xa0""The times in which we could completely depend on others are, to a certain extent, over,"" she told the rally in Munich.""I've experienced that in the last few days. We Europeans truly have to take our fate into our own hands,"" she said. Her comments came as she steps up her campaign in the September federal election.\xc2\xa0The image of friendly relations between Germany and the U.S. seems distant since Trump took office. His administration has previously said that Germany's trade surplus is a result of the country's manipulation of the euro.\xc2\xa0Germany fought back arguing that it doesn't have powers to manipulate the euro and the only reason consumers opt for its products is\xc2\xa0because they are more competitive.Data released last February by the German Federal Statistics Office showed that Germany's trade surplus rose to 252.9 billion euros ($270.05 billion) in 2016, surpassing the previous high of 244.3 billion euros in 2015.\xc2\xa0If it were a single trade partner, Germany would be the fifth largest in total trade flows with the U.S. But it runs the third largest trade surplus, after China and Japan.Meanwhile, contributions to the defense alliance NATO has emerged as another problem between Berlin and Washington. Trump has repeatedly asked NATO allies to step up their contributions. At the moment, only 5 of the 28 members fulfill\xc2\xa0the target\xc2\xa0of paying at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product  on defense.According to NATO data, Germany is currently spending 1.2 percent of its GDP on NATO.

23,This is Denny's ace in the hole as it ventures into delivery,Restaurants,26-05-2017,"Source: Denny'sDenny's is finally entering the delivery game and it's got a secret weapon.Starting Tuesday, about 50 percent of the company's restaurants will be able to use third-party delivery services to bring pancakes, burgers and milkshakes right to your door.The diner chain partnered with digital ordering heavyweight Olo to launch its on-demand ordering service. Olo, which has worked with more than 160 restaurant brands nationwide, has helped drive growth for many companies by creating an easier and more streamlined online ordering system.While Denny's website and app are impressive, offering customers the ability to customize their orders with a swipe of their finger and track delivery in real time, the real hero of the chain's new service is its plastic containers.Anyone who has ever ordered french fries, knows that they can get soggy from the condensation that gathers on the lid of the container. Situations like these are one of the biggest hurtles that restaurants face to deliver food that tastes just like it would at the restaurant.""The packages are designed to keep the Denny's quality food still quality food when it gets to the off-premise location,"" John Dillon, chief marketing officer at Denny's, told CNBC.The company has created several different packages for its wide variety of menu items. For its breakfast foods, Denny's containers have a separate section just for the pancakes that sits above the basin that holds the eggs, hash browns and bacon.The lid is vented to keep the food from getting soggy, but still keeps the items warm.Other containers, like the one that Denny's will place its burgers in, feature tweets from Denny's to ""add a little personality"" to the packages, Dillon said.Source: Denny'sAll packaging is microwavable and made with sustainable materials, which means that they can be recycled after use.Delivery has become a major priority for restaurants in the last year, particularly as mobile and online ordering have become more popular with consumers.Digital orders have increased by 45 percent since 2014, according to The NPD Group, and now account for nearly 1.7 billion in food service visits.In addition, mobile order checks tend to be as much as 20 to 30 percent higher than a traditional in-store check. That's because customers have more time to consider their options, and restaurants are better able to upsell.Upselling is a technique by which a chain can offer upgrades or add-ons to meals at regular or a discounted price, in an attempt to ring up a higher sale.Dillon told CNBC that this is just the start for Denny's delivery. The company will continue to roll out the service across its entire system.Correction: This story was revised to correct that the tweets on the packages were sent by Denny's.

24,Michael Flynn will provide some documents under subpoena to Senate intel panel,Politics,30-05-2017,"Michael FlynnCarlos Barria | ReutersFormer National Security Adviser Michael Flynn will provide documents to the Senate intelligence committee as part of its probe into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election, The Associated Press has learned.Flynn will turn over documents related to two of his businesses as well as some personal documents the committee requested earlier this month, a person close to Flynn said. Flynn plans to produce documents by next week. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss Flynn's private interactions with the committee.The decision Tuesday was the first signal that Flynn and the Senate panel have found common ground. Congressional investigators continue to press for key documents in the ongoing investigation, and the retired lieutenant general is trying to limit damaging disclosures that hostile Democratic lawmakers could use against him.Flynn had previously invoked his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination in declining an earlier request from the committee. Flynn's attorneys had argued the initial request was too broad and would have required Flynn to turn over information that could have been used against him.Flynn's cooperation came as President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, rejected a request for documents as part of a House committee's separate probe into Russia's election meddling and contacts with the Trump campaign.Cohen, a longtime attorney for the Trump Organization, remains a personal lawyer for Trump. He served as a cable television surrogate for the Republican during the presidential campaign.The House intelligence committee's request for information from Cohen came as the investigators continued to scrutinize members of Trump's inner circle, including Flynn. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said last week that a subpoena for Flynn from the House panel was likely.""I declined the invitation to participate as the request was poorly phrased, overly broad and not capable of being answered,"" Cohen told The Associated Press. ""I find it irresponsible and improper that the request sent to me was leaked by those working on the committee.""Cohen told ABC News Tuesday that he had been asked by both the House and Senate intelligence committees to provide information and testimony about contacts he had with Russian officials.Russian President Vladimir Putin said the allegations of Moscow meddling in the U.S. presidential election are ""fiction"" invented by the Democrats in order to explain their loss. In an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro, Putin reaffirmed his strong denial of Russian involvement in the hacking of Democratic emails. The interview was recorded during Putin's Monday trip to Paris and released Tuesday.Trump made a similar claim in a tweet early Tuesday: ""Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.""Cohen's ties with Russian interests came up in February when The New York Times reported that Cohen helped to broker a Ukraine peace plan that would call for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine and a referendum to let Ukrainians decide whether the part of the country seized by Russia in 2014 should be leased to Moscow. The Russian government denied knowing anything about such a plan.The Times reported that the peace plan was the work of Felix Sater, a business associate who has helped Trump try to find business in Russia, and Cohen.Cohen was a fierce defender of Trump during the campaign, often haranguing probing reporters and famously challenging a CNN reporter live on-air to name the specific polls that showed then-candidate Trump behind his rival, Hillary Clinton.In the early 2000s, he formed his own firm working on a range of legal matters, including malpractice cases, business law and work on an ethanol business in Ukraine. Cohen also owned and operated a handful of taxi medallions, managing a fleet of cabs in New York.Cohen's business associates in the taxi enterprise included a number of men from the former Soviet Union, including his Ukrainian-born father-in-law.Cohen has made his own unsuccessful attempts at public office, losing a city council race and briefly running for state assembly in New York.Watch: House Oversight says Flynn misled investigatorsVIDEO0:5700:57Michael Flynn misled investigators, according to House Oversight letterDigital Original",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/30/michael-flynn-will-provide-some-documents-under-subpoena-to-senate-intel-panel.html

The deal was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.""It is a cynically opportunist bet. Can they do it? Yes. Should they be doing it at this particular time? No,"" she said in an interview with ""Closing Bell.""""They are effectively pushing geopolitics at the expense of people. They are not simply providing cash into the \xe2\x80\xa6 central bank reserves, which right now is at an all-time low,"" she added.The president of Venezuela's National Assembly, Julio Borges, participates in a rally against President Nicolas Maduro's government in Caracas on April 13, 2017.Federico Parra | AFP | Getty ImagesGoldman Sachs bought the bonds ""on the secondary market from a broker and did not interact with the Venezuelan government,"" the bank said in a statement, adding: ""We recognize that \xe2\x80\xa6 Venezuela is in crisis. We agree that life there has to get better, and we made the investment in part because we believe it will.""The move led the leader of Venezuela's National Assembly, Julio Borges, to threaten that a later government may refuse to honor the bonds. Borges accuses the firm of ""making a quick buck off the suffering of Venezuelan people"" by hoping to prop up the regime of embattled President Nicolas Maduro.However, Prins believes Goldman is simply betting that things will change.""If they change because of political regime change \xe2\x80\xa6 there can be a bump to the value of \xe2\x80\xa6 those bonds if there is a more fundamental opposition coming in, which is what I believe Goldman Sachs is betting on,"" she said.Steve Hanke, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, doesn't buy ""this massive geopolitical story.""""They're on the secondary market. Somebody's going to own them. Whether Goldman owns them or somebody else it really doesn't make any difference,"" said Hanke, also a senior fellow at the Cato Institute.However, he doesn't think Goldman managed its reputation risk in a prudent way.""They didn't think it through.

26,"Memorial Day thieves steal 30,000 condoms",Crime,30-05-2017,"Source: LELOA pair of thieves in Las Vegas seemingly had some big plans for the holiday weekend, breaking into a warehouse twice \xe2\x80\x94 and escaping with tens of thousands of condoms and over $10,000 worth of sex toys.The two-part heist began Friday evening. Lelo, the sex toy company that was the victim of the robbery, had closed its warehouse early for the long weekend, leaving it empty.At about 7:45 p.m., the security cameras captured two men entering through a back gate and walking away with two shipping boxes filled with the company's Lelo Hex condoms. Each box, says the company, contained 15,120 individually wrapped condoms.That must not have been quite enough, though, as the thieves then returned to grab a few more 36-packs of the condoms before leaving. (The retail value of the heist is difficult to determine because the condoms were individually wrapped, but a 36-pack normally retails for $35.)""The dumbest part of this?"" the company posited in a harshly worded blog post detailing the robbery. ""In a few days, we're about to give away thousands of Hex condoms for free anyway. They could have just waited and asked for them like everyone else.""It gets weirder.The following day, May 27, at 10:30 a.m., a rental car rammed through the loading dock of the warehouse, and a man grabbed three large boxes of sex toys and threw them into the back of the car before running to the passenger side of the vehicle. (It's unclear if it was the same duo as the previous night, but the company is operating under the assumption it was.)Among the items taken? A box of 33 prostate massagers and 48 Kegel exercising aids. (The contents of the third box were not disclosed.)In both instances, Las Vegas police arrived after the thieves had left the premises.Lelo is asking for the public's help in identifying the criminals and in finding its stolen property, but it has also acknowledged the ridiculous nature of the crime.""What kind of party are these people having?"" it asked in its blog post, tongue firmly in cheek. ""We could have done the sponsorship or something. A friggin' invite might have been nice.""Lelo's U.S. president, Pavle Sedic, in a more serious note, called the raids ""shocking,"" but said the difficulty in getting additional security around the Memorial Day holiday was likely a factor in the act.Officials at the Las Vegas Police Department confirmed to CNBC that two burglary reports were taken at the warehouse on the dates the company said the incidents took place. The cases remain under investigation.Lelo is one of the sex toy industry's higher-end manufacturers. Its products can be found in mainstream retail stores like Brookstone, and its approach to making premium-priced adult novelties with higher-quality materials is part of the reason the industry has seen sales surge over the past 10 years.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/30/memorial-day-thieves-steal-30000-condoms.html

28,"Electric vehicle demand to skyrocket, but won't kill gasoline just yet, says analyst",Autos,30-05-2017,"VIDEO1:3701:37Here's why electric cars won't kill gasoline... yetDigital OriginalGlobal demand for electric vehicles will surge during the next few decades, but gasoline is probably not going away soon, said a new research note from Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas.Jonas said in a note Tuesday that electric vehicles will make up 50 percent to 60 percent of all light vehicles sold around the world by 2040. But he does not expect that rise to coincide with a precipitous decline in global demand for gasoline, contrary to more bearish views. That's because while electric car sales will grow, the impact from developments in the areas of shared and autonomous driving will reduce the cost of transportation around the world at a much faster pace. This will lead to an explosion of driving around the world that will continue to keep internal combustion engines relevant for the next two decades. Specifically, Jonas envisions a model where private car ownership declines, while ""megafleets"" of autonomous cars ferry passengers around at low costs, reducing the cost per mile from as much as $1 per vehicle mile today (76 cents per mile in the U.S., according to AAA) to as little as 20 cents over time.VIDEO0:4600:46Elon Musk's Boring Company released pictures of new electric vehicle conceptNews VideosCurrently, about 50 percent of the roughly $1.50/mile cost of an UberX, or 75 cents, goes to the cost of the human driver, he said. ""Our simulations,"" he said, ""have suggested that replacing a human driver ($50k per year) with an autonomous car (<$5k of equipment up front) can yield payback periods as little as 5 or 6 weeks!""Uber is not the only company at work on this. Tesla has said it is working on an autonomous ride-sharing network, and traditional automakers, such as General Motors, have already begun experimenting with (non-autonomous) car-sharing services through its Maven brand.Should this push continue, the number of total miles driven could double by 2030 and triple by 2040, Jonas said. He estimates the world's approximately 1 billion cars are driving about 10 trillion miles.The impacts will be especially salient in emerging markets, Jonas said. While they took up about 30 percent of the global demand gasoline demand in 2015, they will make up about 70 percent of demand by 2040. This does not mean gasoline is safe from competition \xe2\x80\x94 Jonas' base case assumes a compound annual decline of 0.2 percent through 2040.But there will still be many cars in the world heading to the pump.

33,Jeff Bezos is getting closer to becoming the richest man,Wealth,30-05-2017,"Jeff Bezos, AmazonBrent Lewis | The Denver Post | Getty ImagesWith Amazon's stock price brushing $1,000, Jeff Bezos is within striking distance of becoming the world's richest man.As of Friday's close, Bezos was worth $85.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire's Index. Bill Gates is at $88.8 billion. So assuming that Microsoft's share price remains constant or falls, Bezos needed another $3.8 billion to top Gates.Amazon's stock gains Tuesday have added another $340 million to his wealth, so he's now just $3.5 billion shy of the richest man title. To get there, Amazon's share price would reach about $1,042. (Forbes' Real-Time List has slightly different calculations, putting Bezos at $84.9 billion as of Friday, and Gates at $88.5 billion but the gap is about the same).Of course, Gates may soar and Amazon could tumble. And he still has a ways to go.But given Amazon's seemingly unstoppable march to dominate the web and other markets, Bezos is likely to gain the top spot in the coming weeks or months.Bezos would be the first man to bump Gates from his perch as the world's richest man since Carlos Slim in 2010. Gates has dominated the list for much of the past quarter century, holding the top spot for 18 of the last 23 years, according to Forbes.

34,The worst thing Disney could do to fix ESPN is 'bet the company' on an expensive acquisition,Tech,29-05-2017,"The Walt Disney Company Chairman and CEO Bob Iger, and Twitter Co-Founder and Chairman and Square CEO Jack DorseyMichael Kovac | Vanity Fair | Getty ImagesRich Greenfield of BTIG has been a thorn in the side of Disney and CEO Bob Iger for a while now. Rich believes that Disney has done too little to respond to the changing shifts of consumers away from linear TV to digital. He specifically has attacked ESPN's shedding of linear subscribers in the traditional cable bundle and how it's been too slow to launch a direct-to-consumer over-the-top version.In a  recent blog post, Rich lays out what he would do today if he had Bob Iger's job running Disney:Stop Buying Back StockTerminate ESPN President John SkipperBuy Twitter and Reinvent SportsCenterBuy Spotify To Plant Direct-to-Consumer RootsAcquire EA or ActivisionI don't agree with some of Rich's points.Why is it necessary to stop buying stock? Continuing to do so doesn't preclude them from looking at future attractive deals.Skipper doesn't deserve to be fired. He is very well-liked within ESPN. He made some comments 18 months ago to the Wall Street Journal about requiring new hires to the Worldwide Leader to bring their cable bills on campus to demonstrate their loyalty to the cable bundle which seemed tone-deaf, but his comments since have been on the mark. He's cutting costs (although he's likely going to have to do more). All their bidding on sports rights a couple of years ago seems smart now rather than stupid, with live sports viewership up in Q1 vs. a year ago compared to scripted shows demonstrating declines.I actually think it's more likely that Skipper re-ups with ESPN again in 2018 when his contract is up rather than him getting sacked. (He has some good internal potential successors too.)M&A should certainly be considered, but a huge buy is not the way to go. Disney is riding high currently as a result of three canny acquisitions: Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm -- all done by Iger.In Rich's blog post, he brings up the transformational  Disney acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC back in August 1995. Back then, the deal valued Capital Cities at $19 billion. That made it the second biggest deal of all-time after KKR/Nabisco. The deal also brought Bob Iger to Disney to start working under Michael Eisner and later succeed him.The day before Disney bought Cap Cities/ABC, Disney's market cap was only $29 billion, or only 60% of the combined value of the companies. Talk about betting your company on a big deal.To put that into modern-day perspective, Disney today is worth $170 billion in market cap. To make a similarly-sized ""bet the company"" type of transformational deal, Disney would need to spend $113 billion. That would definitely get some business press attention.Another way of thinking about it is to think of Rich's M&A list. Disney could buy all the targets mentioned at their current market caps -- Twitter for $13 billion, Spotify for $12 billion (its rumored target IPO price), EA for $37 billion, Activision for $45 billion, and add a 10% premium for good measure for a total of $117 billion.It's hard to imagine Disney doing such a series of deals today, yet that's how enormous the Capital Cities deal was at the time.Capital Cities wasn't even about ESPNBut if you think the deal was a slam dunk at the time because of Capital Cities' 80% ownership of ESPN, consider this article about the deal from the New York Times at the time. Very little about ESPN's growth potential was mentioned. In 1995, ESPN had 67 million subs and ESPN2 only 26 million. It was estimated to be worth $4 - 5 billion in 1995 and produced $350 million in annual free cash flow.Jonathan Alcorn | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesInstead, the highest growth potential was seen in ABC:The combined company would bring together the most profitable television network and its ESPN cable service with Disney's Hollywood film and television studios, the Disney Channel, its theme parks and its repository of well-known cartoon characters and the merchandise sales they generate [emphasis mine]. What Disney brings to ABC, a company that has usually bought its television programs from outsiders, is a highly creative culture committed to developing and distributing original and innovative programs. That should make the ABC network a more formidable rival to its counterparts and to the cable programming services that continue to erode the networks' share of audience. What Disney gains is a national distribution network for its programming, perhaps a Saturday morning television home for its cartoons, and a company known for its news and sports coverage, as well as hit comedies like ""Roseanne"" and ""Home Improvement."" Mr. Eisner has toyed for some years with buying a network and has talked about a merger with the CBS chairman, Laurence A. Tisch, reportedly as recently as several weeks ago. But yesterday, in a clear indication of his preference for Capital Cities/ABC, Mr. Eisner described it as a company that ""has been moving forward strategically.""There's no focus in that initial take on the deal on the potential for ESPN . It's all about ABC and Disney getting access to one of the ""big three"" networks. ESPN hadn't yet exploded in consumer popularity and fat per sub affiliate fees.  Eisner did speak about the potential for ESPN, but he  focused on two key areas: ""international expansion and exploitation of the ubiquitous ESPN brand at Disney's theme parks and retail stores.""  Neither of these areas represented the real potential for ESPN.  Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good.Not every company follows the Innovator's Dilemma narrativeIt might be flashy to say Disney should blow up ESPN as a cable network of go all in on OTT, but it's just not good business to turn your back on cable networks which are generating $16.5 billion a year in revenues.Not everything has to follow the Innovator's Dilemma narrative of a big profitable company getting disrupted by the nimble start-up.Not every big company has to end up like Nokia in the dustbin of history.Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?, asked Lou Gerstner after successfully reinvigorating IBM without blowing it up.Disney and ESPN need to protect that $16.5 billion a year Cable Networks business as long as they can while doing lots of experimenting with new direct-to-consumer over-the-top services. That's why they made the investment (which will lead to control later) in BAMTech. But they can't stop there. They should look at more deals which will help them experiment with new services and revenue streams.But to ""bet the company"" again just because the CapCities deal worked out for reasons that Eisner never anticipated? No. The story of Capital Cities and Disney shows that we all need to stay humble about our ability to predict the future. To sign up for Eric's monthly Tech & Media Email,  go here.

39,Trump administration nearing completion of Cuba policy review: Sources,Politics,30-05-2017,"A large drawing of Cuba's late President Fidel Castro is displayed in the Playa neighborhood of Havana, Cuba, November 29, 2016.ReutersThe Trump administration is nearing completion of a policy review to determine how far it goes in rolling back former President Barack Obama's engagement with Cuba and could make an announcement next month, according to current and former U.S. officials and people familiar with the discussions.President Donald Trump's advisers are crafting recommendations that could call for tightening some of the trade and travel rules that Obama eased in his rapprochement with Havana but which are expected to stop short of breaking diplomatic relations restored in 2015 after more than five decades of hostility, the sources said.The policy review, coordinated by the National Security Council, is expected to pick up steam now that Trump has returned from his first foreign trip, one administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.The White House did not respond to a request for comment.Trump threatened in a tweet shortly after his election in November to ""terminate"" Obama's approach unless Cuba made significant concessions, something its Communist leadership is unlikely to do.The White House said in February that Cuba policy was under comprehensive review and that human rights on the island would be a major part of any revised strategy.Obama implemented his Cuba normalization measures through executive actions that bypassed Congress, and Trump is believed to have the power to undo much of it with the stroke of a pen.Divisions in Trump administrationBut there are divisions within his administration over to what extent he should go, especially given that Obama's opening to Washington's former Cold War foe has created opportunities for American companies ranging from telecommunications to airlines.Some aides have argued that Trump, a former real estate magnate who won the presidency promising to unleash U.S. businesses and create jobs, would have a hard time defending any moves that close off the Cuban market.A group of 54 U.S. senators reintroduced legislation last Thursday to repeal all remaining restrictions on travel to Cuba, signaling support for U.S.-Cuba detente on Capitol Hill.But the Republican administration has been under heavy pressure from Cuban-American lawmakers such as U.S. Senator Marco Rubio and U.S. Representative Mario Diaz-Balart to take a much harder line than Trump's Democratic predecessor.There is little support in the administration, however, for a full-scale reversal of Obama's steps that began with a breakthrough with Cuban President Raul Castro in 2014.Among the options under consideration are tightening restrictions on U.S. firms doing business with Cuban state or military enterprises and re-imposing stricter rules on Americans traveling there, according to people familiar with the discussions.It remains unclear, however, which recommendation will make their way to Trump, though the sources said a list was likely to be ready for his consideration in coming days or weeks.""We're getting closer,"" an administration official said.An announcement of changes could come as soon as June, according to the official and people familiar with the matter.The Daily Caller newspaper reported on Sunday that Trump would announce policy changes in a June speech in Miami, citing sources from a group opposed to the broader U.S. economic embargo that remains in place against Cuba.But the timing could also depend on factors such as whether Trump fills key Latin America posts at the State Department and elsewhere that remain vacant, sources told Reuters.The White House considered making a Cuba announcement on May 20 to mark the 115th anniversary of Cuba's independence, but that coincided with Trump's overseas trip and the review also was not yet finished, the sources said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/30/trump-administration-nearing-completion-of-cuba-policy-review-sources.html

42,China\xe2\x80\x99s cyber security law rattles multinationals,Cybersecurity,30-05-2017,"Passengers look at smartphones on a subway train on April 6, 2017 in Chengdu, China.VCG | Getty ImagesChina's first cyber security law will increase costs for multinationals, leave them vulnerable to industrial espionage and give Chinese companies an unfair advantage, business representatives and analysts have warned.The measure, which comes into force on Thursday, has been widely welcomed as a milestone in introducing much needed data privacy. But analysts have expressed fears it could help Beijing steal trade secrets or intellectual property from foreign companies.""The law is both extremely vague and exceptionally wide in scope, potentially putting companies at risk of regulatory enforcement that is not related to cyber security,"" said Carly Ramsey, associate director at Control Risks, a risk-management consultancy.More from Financial Times: Japan's tight labour market surpasses 1990 bubble Angela Merkel's blunder, Donald Trump and the end of the west  China's shadow banking crackdown shakes markets Foreign companies had petitioned Beijing to delay the legislation. ""It is vitally important that [these measures are] proportionate, consistent, non-discriminatory and formulated in a transparent manner. Regretfully, this is not yet the case,"" said Michael Chang, vice-president of the European Chamber of Commerce in Beijing.The law is part of a drive by Beijing to shield Chinese data from the eyes of foreign governments after US whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that the US was spying on communications from multinationals, say analysts.""The message is clear that the government will encourage more domestic development of technology, and that it now sees privacy and cyber security as vital national concerns,"" said Xun Yang, a lawyer at Simmons & Simmons in Shanghai.Under the new law, companies must introduce data protection measures \xe2\x80\x94 a novelty for many Chinese businesses \xe2\x80\x94 and data relating to the country's citizens or national security must be held on Chinese servers. Companies will have to submit to a review by regulators before transferring large amounts of personal data abroad.However, ""critical"" companies \xe2\x80\x94 a widely drawn definition that encompasses sensitive entities such as power companies or banks but also any company holding data that, if breached, could ""harm people's livelihoods"" \xe2\x80\x94 will have to store all data collected in China within the country.These companies, and any services bought by them, must go through a ""national security review"" to ensure they and their data systems are ""secure and controllable"".The measure allows Beijing torequest computer program source code, which is usually known only by the software developer. National security reviews may also allow Beijing to delve into companies' intellectual property, analysts warn.Even fast-food delivery companies could be considered critical infrastructure, Shanghai regulators ruled during a pilot run for the law \xe2\x80\x94 presumably, analysts suggest, because they hold information on millions of users.Multinationals will be hardest hit, as the data localisation measures prevent them pooling client data in cloud storage databases across the world. The need to store some data on China-based servers and the rest elsewhere will add to fragmentation and cost. ""It's huge work for foreign companies to restructure their business,"" said Mr Yang.Cloud storage companies are also affected. One lawyer said his foreign clients were switching data from Amazon Web Services in Singapore to Alibaba's China cloud service.China's own technology companies will themselves be hit. The bulk of Alibaba's ecommerce takes place in China, but it has increasingly been setting up cloud data centres around the globe. ""We comply with applicable laws in jurisdictions where we operate,"" said Alibaba.While the new law is causing angst in foreign boardrooms, the personal data privacy provisions are in line with worldwide practice, said Scott Thiel, partner at law firm DLA Piper in Hong Kong. For example, it accords with Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, he said.But analysts suspect enforcement in China might be tinged with political goals. A proposed supplementary law on encryption, published in April, allows the government to demand ""decryption support"" in the interests of national security. Effectively, this means the government can force companies to decode encrypted data.""In the US Apple refused to open [the San Bernardino shooter's] iPhone for the FBI.

43,Steve Cohen reportedly plans record-breaking $20 billion hedge-fund comeback,Hedge Funds,30-05-2017,"VIDEO0:4800:48Billionaire investor Steven Cohen plans $20 billion hedge-fund comebackNews VideosSteve Cohen, whose former investment firm pleaded guilty to criminal insider trading charges, plans to return to hedge funds with a $20 billion goal in mind, The Wall Street Journal reports.The new hedge fund could launch as early as 2018, according to recent conversations Cohen and his representatives have had with bankers, colleagues and potential investors, the Journal says. Cohen is restricted from managing others' money until that time. Should the billionaire's plans go through, this would mark the biggest U.S. hedge-fund launch in history, according to data the Journal accessed from industry publisher Absolute Return.To surpass his $20 billion target, Cohen is prepared to lower his famously high fees, people familiar with Cohen's plans tell the Journal. Cohen's new firm is likely to launch with a so-called pass-through arrangement, a relatively uncommon structure under which recurring expenses are paid directly by investors instead of the fund firm, the people familiar with the proposition add. Cohen's SAC Capital paid $1.2 billion in November 2013 in a settlement with regulators over securities fraud charges. Months after the settlement, Cohen renamed the hedge fund Point72 Asset Management to manage his family's fortune.A representative from Point72 declined to comment, while Cohen was not immediately available for a response.Read the full report from The Wall Street Journal here.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/30/steve-cohen-reportedly-plans-record-20-billion-hedge-fund-comeback.html

49,The cost of borrowing for college is about to go up,College Game Plan ,30-05-2017,"The campus of Columbia University in New York CityGetty ImagesStudents who need to borrow from the federal government to pay for college this fall will get hit with significantly higher interest rates. And the financial burden on lower-income students could increase even more if Congress approves President Donald Trump's plan to eliminate subsidized student loans.The new interest rates on loans for the upcoming academic year are expected to be:Stafford Loan - undergraduate: 4.45 percent, up from 3.76 percentStafford Loan - graduate students: 6 percent, up from 5.31 percentParent PLUS loans: 7 percent, up from 6.3 percentMore from NBC News:Portland mayor wants to cancel alt-right ralliesGermany's Merkel signals deepening rift with U.S. under Trump Mike Dubke, White House communications director, resigns after 3 months on jobThese are fixed rates that apply to new loans made between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2018. The rates on existing loans will not change. And unfortunately, you cannot take out loans for the new school year at current rates.Note: The federal government has not officially announced the new rates. Student loan experts have calculated the change using the Department of Education's formula which is based on the rate of the 10-year Treasury note.""The rates are going up because the Federal Reserve has started raising interest rates at a regular pace and we can expect that they'll continue to go up,"" said Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher of Cappex, a website that helps families search colleges and the scholarships. ""I wouldn't be surprised if we see an increase in the federal student loan interest rates each of the next few years of between half and three-quarters of a percentage point.""Interest rates on federal student loans have been historically low for many years now. This is the first increase since 2014. An undergrad who borrows $10,000 at the new interest rate would pay an extra $3.29 a month or $395 more in interest over 10 years, according to the  student loan calculator at NerdWallet.""This small jump in the interest rate of the loan is not going to be a deal breaker for most students,"" said Penelope Wang, deputy money editor at Consumer Reports. ""The bigger problem is the overall student debt in the U.S. and this certainly does not make the situation any better.""President Trump wants to end subsidized student loansStudent loan experts are worried about the impact of the president's proposed budget that calls for eliminating subsidized student loans for lower-income students. At a time when the nation is trying to find ways to make college more affordable, this would drive up the cost for millions of Americans.Subsidized Stafford loans help lower the high cost of higher education for about six million students a year because the interest doesn't start to accrue while the borrower is in school and for six months after graduation.Subsidized loans also offer an interest-free grace period of up to three years for someone who is on active duty military service, unemployed or having some other qualified financial hardship.""Removing the subsidy is equivalent to almost doubling the effective interest rate on these subsidized loans,' Kantrowitz told NBC News. ""About half of all students graduate with some amount of subsidized Stafford loans \xe2\x80\x94 the average for a Bachelor's degree is around $13,000 \xe2\x80\x94 so that is going to increase the cost of paying for college much more so than the change in the interest rates."" In a recent blog post, The Institute for College Access & Success criticized the Trump administration's budget proposal:""At a time where there is growing public concern about rising student debt and broad consensus on the importance of higher education and post-secondary training to the US economy, we need to be doing more, not less, to keep college within reach for all Americans.""TICAS, an independent and non-profit organization that works to make higher education affordable for people of all backgrounds, ran the numbers on the impact of eliminating these subsidized loans.""For the average student who borrows $23,000 and graduates within five years with a BA, they start out with $3,400 more in debt than they would otherwise. Over the life of the loan, we see even greater costs in terms of the total cost of borrowing,"" said Jessica Thompson, TICAS policy and research director. ""This would be a really big cut for no real reason. It's not being reinvested in a different way to reduce college costs for low-income students, so we are very concerned about this.""As Consumer Reports explains in  a recent blog post, the proposed White House budget calls for ""a major restructure"" of the federal student loan program in ways that could hurt borrowers struggling to make their payments. It would end public-service loan forgiveness and overhaul the programs that allow income-driven repayment plans.The\xc2\xa0growing burden of student loan debtThe steadily increasing price of higher education \xe2\x80\x94 and the growing cost of borrowing to pay for it \xe2\x80\x94 is taking a toll on the nation's psyche. Americans currently owe $1.4 trillion dollars in student loan debt. Experts say this is putting a strain on family budgets as well as the U.S. economy.Sixty-nine percent of all Americans lack confidence that everyone who seeks higher education will be able to pay for it, according to the latest Consumer Voices Survey by Consumer Reports.Bankrate.com  recently surveyed 1,000 people about their financial regrets. While the most common regret is not saving enough for retirement, taking on too much student loan debt topped the list for millennials (27-36 years old).""This is an unsustainable situation as far as the amount of student loan debt we're racking up, and I really hate to see millennials and their parents getting hit with these payments that can go on for decades,"" said Mark Hamrick, Bankrate's senior economic analyst. ""Colleges and universities by and large have become conditioned to expect that students and their parents will take out these loans no matter what, so it's as if the escalation in tuition costs will continue forever. And I would suggest it cannot.""Financial experts have this advice for students and families who need loans to pay for college:Don't borrow more than you can realistically repay: Here's the rule of thumb. Try not to borrow any more than your expected annual starting salary after graduation. If your total debt at graduation is less than your annual income, you can afford to repay your student loans in 10 years or under.If you need to look beyond federal loans, you should think twice about the cost of the college you're considering, Consumer Reports cautions readers. In that case, you may be taking on much more debt than you can comfortably repay.Try to avoid private loans: Private loans are typically variable rate. Federal loans have a fixed rate. Even with the interest rate hike, federal loans are still a good deal.""Any federal loan is preferable to taking out a private loan,"" Jessica Thompson at TICAS told NBC News. ""We consider private loans akin to putting your education expenses on a credit card. They are really something to avoid if at all possible.""In most cases, the student requires a parent or grandparent to cosign for that loan, which puts their credit on the hook.Cappex has a  detailed article outlining the differences between federal and private student loans.Federal loans also come with many protections that private loans rarely provide, such as repayment options that can see you through hard times.The most important thing families can do is to save for college, Mark Kantrowitz at Cappex told NBC News, so they can borrow less.""Every dollar you save is a dollar less you'll need to borrow. And every dollar you borrow will cost about two dollars by the time you repay the debt. So it's literally cheaper to save than to borrow,"" he said.Where to get help and guidanceIf you need help managing your student loans, contact the  American Student Assistance program. They have online tools and can also provide individual counseling.Many credit counselors can now help people struggling with student debt. You can find a list of certified non-profit student loan counselors on the  National Foundation for Credit Counseling website.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau site has a variety of student loan resources in its Paying for College section.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/30/the-cost-of-borrowing-for-college-is-about-to-go-up.html
50,ECB to discuss closing door to extra stimulus next week: Sources,Central Banks,30-05-2017,"VIDEO3:0703:07ECB's Draghi: Monetary support still necessarySquawk Box EuropeEuropean Central Bank policymakers are set to take a more benign view of the economy when they meet on June 8 and will even discuss dropping some of their pledges to ramp up stimulus if needed, four sources with direct knowledge of the discussions told Reuters.With economic growth clearly shifting into higher gear, rate setters are ready to acknowledge the improvement by dropping a long-standing reference to downside risks in the bank's post-meeting opening statement, calling risks largely balanced, the sources said. Growth indicators have been outperforming expectations all year.But they disagree on how quickly the ECB should change its policy stance, including its guidance, with countries on the currency bloc's periphery fearing that a sharp shift in its communication could induce self-defeating market turbulence, they added.""After the French election the political risk is clearly down and economic indicators are by and large positive, so it's time to acknowledge this,"" said one Governing Council member who declined to be named.Having fought off the threat of deflation with years of extraordinary stimulus, the debate within the ECB is shifting to the pace of normalisation, pitting doves who want incremental changes against conservatives who fear that the ECB could miss its cue, forcing more abrupt moves later.DANIEL ROLAND | AFP | Getty Images""The positive environment has been relatively short compared to the long periods of crises we had,"" another source said. ""It wouldn't be responsible to base a major policy shift on such a short upswing.""A key debate at the June 8 meeting is likely to be whether the bank should axe all or part of its so-called easing bias, a pledge keep rates at their current or lower levels for an extended period and to increase the volume of asset buys if the outlook worsens.Though many investors expect a decision on this, the sources said that this was far from certain.""This will be the first time we discuss this so I don't necessarily expect a decision,"" another source said.Indeed, ECB chief Mario Draghi signaled caution on Tuesday, arguing that due to weak underlying inflation, he was firmly convinced that an ""extraordinary amount"" of monetary policy support is still needed.Inflation figures due on Wednesday are expected to show a dip in both headline and underlying price growth, potentially easing pressure on the ECB.The ECB declined to comment.Though ECB decisions require a simple majority, votes are not always taken and decisions normally enjoy a full or near consensus.VIDEO3:0903:09ECB to continue to be dovish: Lombard Odier IMSquawk Box EuropeGradualismThe split among policymakers has become evident even within the six-member Executive Board, putting top allies of Draghi in different camps.Chief Economist Peter Praet has warned that even incremental changes in communication could send strong signals, while Vice President Vitor Constancio argued that it is better for the ECB to be late rather than early in removing stimulus.But board member Benoit Coeure has noted that too much gradualism bears the risk of a larger market correction down the road, highlighting the risk of market expectations becoming detached from the bank's guidance.""Everybody knows we won't cut rates, so formally acknowledging that should cause no ripples,"" one of the sources said. ""There is a credibility problem when your signals are very different than what the market expects. We're not yet there but it's a risk.""Removing the reference to further rate cuts could risk strengthening the euro, a problem as the currency has already gained more than 5 percent since mid-April against the dollar.While the ECB does not have an exchange rate target, a continued rise would hurt exporters on the periphery and dampen inflation expectations.But removing the reference to higher asset buys could push yields higher, a worry as the ECB has already highlighted growing debt sustainability concerns.The ECB is also facing political uncertainty in Italy, one of its weaker member, which might not abate until elections are held later this year or early next year.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

It's equipped with a sharp display that runs from edge-to-edge and takes up almost the entire front of the device, Qualcomm's high-end Snapdragon 835 processor camera and what Essential says is ""one of the world's best phone cameras."" It doesn't have a headphone jack, though, and will instead ship with a dongle in the box.It's also made out of titanium, instead of aluminum, which Essential says will help the phone survive accidental drops.EssentialIt can be outfitted with a $50 360-degree camera accessory \xe2\x80\x94 likely for recording content to view back in virtual reality or on social networks \xe2\x80\x94 which snaps to the back of the device. There's also a cordless charging mat and docking station, which the phone snaps on to with magnets. This is a modular approach to accessories that we've seen before from companies such as LG and, more successfully, from Motorola Mobility. Essential will likely continue to build and sell other accessories that snap onto the smartphone.Essential is entering a tough market that's dominated by Apple and Samsung. While the 360-degree camera accessory is compelling and the specs are high-end, there's not a whole lot here that suggests Essential is going to take considerable market share from the iPhone or Galaxy devices.In a letter posted to Twitter, Andy Rubin explained why he's entering the smartphone market again.

55,Australia's real estate boom has Wall Street wooing a newspaper publisher,Real Estate,30-05-2017,"A TV crew films outside the Fairfax Media headquarters in Sydney, Australia, May 3, 2017.Jason Reed | ReutersWall Street has started a bidding war for Fairfax Media, an Australian company best known for the dowdy business of publishing newspapers. To understand why, look no further than Deanna McMath.Ms. McMath, owner of a small business specializing in print and design, is trying to determine the value of the fixer-upper house she bought in 2009 in the Sydney suburb of Stanmore, and whether to sell it and cash in on the area's wild property boom. Where she once would turn to the real estate pages of The Sydney Morning Herald, a Fairfax paper, she now scours two online real estate portals: Realestate.com.au, which is part of Rupert Murdoch's media empire, under News Corporation, and Domain, which has quietly become Fairfax's most lucrative business.""They're the only two sites I go to,"" she said. ""There's nothing in the papers. You don't pick up The Herald anymore on a Saturday to see what's for sale.""More from New York Times: Behind the scenes at Orchard Platform, a struggle to innovateChina's ill, and wealthy, look abroad for medical treatmentThe Ringer, Bill Simmons' site, will switch its host to Vox MediaAustralia's two biggest cities \xe2\x80\x94 Sydney and Melbourne \xe2\x80\x94 are having an extended, how-long-can-it-last surge in property prices, and for global investors, Fairfax's Domain offers a piece of the action.Two large American private equity firms, TPG Capital and Hellman & Friedman, are bidding to buy Fairfax, valuing the company at nearly $3 billion. That isn't bad for a company that, just weeks ago, said it would have  to sharply reduce staffing at many of its newspapers to contain costs.Australia's  remarkable \xe2\x80\x94 and unbalanced \xe2\x80\x94 property boom appears to be the driver behind the bids.""They've formed an investment thesis that real estate's just got a lot of value in it,"" Damien Tampling, a partner in Deloitte Australia's technology and media practice, said of the bidders for Fairfax.That has raised concerns that the intense focus on a real estate market that may or may not keep growing will put at risk Fairfax's most visible assets: major newspapers including The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, based in Melbourne. Staff members at those papers went on a weeklong strike this month over imminent job cuts, and they fear that both Fairfax bidders would further shrink print operations in order to invest in the company's digital real estate advertising arm.The bidding war also sets up another battle, between News Corporation, one of Australia's biggest media companies, and well-funded Wall Street investors bent on making money from Australians' fascination with property prices.Sensitive to the worries about what a deal might do to Australia's media landscape, TPG has pledged to nurture the newspapers. Hellman & Friedman officials have declined to comment. Fairfax owns community newspapers and has interests in online video, digital publishing and radio.Australia as a whole is grappling with a slowdown in demand for the iron ore, coal, milk and other resources it exports to China and elsewhere. As Australia's growth has slowed, its central bank has cut interest rates to help keep the economy humming.But Sydney and Melbourne stand as glaring exceptions, making the country something of a two-track economy. Those two cities are experiencing much stronger job creation and economic growth, and the low interest rates translate into cheaper mortgages for people there, making buying and selling a lot more attractive.As a result, both cities are experiencing a property boom. Until last year, when the overall Australian market slowed, Sydney and Melbourne regularly had double-digit annual growth in house prices. Elsewhere in the country, the growth was slower, or even negative.""The Australian housing market is going gangbusters,"" said Terry Rawnsley, an economist with SGS Economics and Planning. ""Wages and profits are up in Sydney and Melbourne, so people have got more money in their pockets.""The listings business offers a way to cash in on the boom. Domain's digital revenue grew 15 percent in the six-month period that ended in December while Fairfax's overall revenue dropped almost 5 percent. Fairfax's revenue fell about 2 percent in its fiscal year that ended last June.Like many media companies, Fairfax  is struggling to keep readers as the number of news outlets online grows. The company's stock, which has surged since the bidding began, is still below the levels it reached before the global financial crisis, even as the broader Australian market has bounced back.Domain and Realestate.com.au enjoy a duopoly in selling ads for residential real estate, property agents say. Listings can cost 1,500 Australian dollars (about $1,100) per property, said Jonathan Hammond, an agent with Cobden & Hayson.""If you want to get the right price,"" Mr. Hammond said, ""you need to get on those websites.""Those are the sorts of conditions that can draw big private equity investors. Sometimes castigated as corporate raiders,  private equity firms use money from pension funds, wealthy investors and other sources to buy a company, streamline it and resell it, often by listing it on a stock market. Sometimes private equity firms borrow the money they use to strike a deal, which can put even more pressure on the firm to turn around a company.When it works, a company can come out in much better shape \xe2\x80\x94 although a number of high-profile bets have also stumbled. TPG, formerly Texas Pacific Group, got its start buying out and fixing Continental Airlines in the United States in the early 1990s, but it was also involved in the  costly and troubled buyout of the Texas utility giant TXU. It now owns stakes in the Spanish-language broadcaster Univision, the room-sharing platform Airbnb and the avant-garde circus Cirque du Soleil. Hellman & Friedman, which was founded in the 1980s, has invested in the German publisher Axel Springer, the asset management firm Franklin Templeton Investments and the Nasdaq Stock Market.Both TPG and Hellman & Friedman have investments in property-listing firms outside Australia. Greg Ellis, who is leading Hellman & Friedman's Fairfax takeover effort, runs the firm's Scout24 listings company in Germany and is a former executive at the digital advertising company REA Group, which has News Corporation as its majority owner and in turn owns Realestate.com.au.REA said it was unfazed by looming competition with Wall Street money. ""In this market, our competitors are local and global, private and public,"" Tracey Fellows, REA Group's chief executive, said in a statement, adding that Realestate.com.au had a sizable lead on the competition in monthly site visits.Both TPG and Hellman & Friedman face questions from lawmakers skeptical of the impact of a deal on Australia's media landscape. Speaking at a Senate hearing in Australia this month, Joel Thickins, the head of TPG Capital's Australia operations, said the firm would not be bidding $2.7 billion for Fairfax if it did not intend ""to grow the business and make it successful and sustainable over the long term."" Hellman & Friedman executives are expected to testify as well, although the date has not been set.Outside the real estate business, Fairfax staff members worry about job cuts and diminished news coverage. Speaking before another Senate committee this month, Paul Murphy, chief executive of the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, Australia's national journalists' union, said, ""We really are at a crossroads for public interest journalism in this country.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/30/australias-real-estate-boom-has-wall-street-wooing-a-newspaper-publisher.html

60,The future of European transit: Driverless and utilitarian,Transportation,30-05-2017,"A self-driving bus being tested in Helsinki.Ugri Touko Tapani Hujanen | The New York TimesOn the outskirts of Berlin, Michael Barill\xc3\xa8re-Scholz is testing a driverless vehicle that is neither sleek nor futuristic. The machine is boxy and painted white. Its top speed barely reaches 20 miles per hour.The self-driving vehicle is a shuttle with room for 12 passengers. Mr. Barill\xc3\xa8re-Scholz, who leads the driverless research team at Deutsche Bahn, Germany's largest train and bus operator, and his team have been testing the vehicle around a local office park. Later this year, the partly state-owned public transit company will also begin separate trials of a similar autonomous bus on public roads in southern Germany, connecting a local train station with stops along a predetermined route.""We want to show that autonomous cars don't have to be limited to luxury consumer vehicles, they also have a role in public transport,"" Mr. Barill\xc3\xa8re-Scholz said. ""The market in Germany for this type of vehicle is huge."" More from New York Times: Behind the scenes at Orchard Platform, a struggle to innovateChina's ill, and wealthy, look abroad for medical treatment The Ringer, Bill Simmons' site, will switch its host to Vox MediaThe coming age of driverless cars has typically centered on Silicon Valley highfliers like Tesla, Uber and Google, which have showcased their autonomous driving technology in luxury sedans and sport utility vehicles costing $100,000 or more. But across Europe, fledgling driverless projects like those by Deutsche Bahn are instead focused on utilitarian self-driving vehicles for mass transit that barely exceed walking pace.Forgoing the latest automotive trends of aerodynamics and style, European transportation groups and city planners are instead aiming to connect these unglamorous driverless vehicles to existing public transportation networks of subways and buses. The goal is to eventually offer on-demand driverless services to those who cannot afford the latest expensive offerings from Tesla and others.""When it comes to public transportation, we're really close on making this technology work,"" said Harri Santamala, who  coordinates several projects involving autonomous public transport in Finland and directs a ""smart mobility"" program at Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences.While cities in the United States \xe2\x80\x94 including Ann Arbor, Mich., and Las Vegas \xe2\x80\x94 have tested some of these mass transit driverless vehicles, Europe is a particular hotbed of this activity. That is because of the region's densely packed urban areas and decades-old and widely used public transit systems, which often include subways, trains and buses.In total, more than 20 pilot or existing public transport programs have taken place in Europe involving autonomous vehicles, according to a review by The New York Times. Most of these projects have received government funding, tapping into local research institutions and tech start-ups that are not household names.""Most of our shuttles have been to more places than I have,"" said Lauren Isaac, director of business initiatives for North America at Easymile, a French autonomous transit company that is working on driverless shuttles.For those who dream of owning a sleek driverless vehicle of the future, this generation of autonomous public shuttles \xe2\x80\x94 often half the length of a traditional bus with capacity for less than a dozen people \xe2\x80\x94 will not set hearts racing. Though they include much of the high-tech sensors and gadgetry required for autonomous driving, the vehicles are designed for functionality rather than speed and style.""With our first vehicle, the goal was just to get in on the road as quickly as possible,"" said Christophe Sapet, chief executive of Navya, a French start-up that designs autonomous shuttle buses that have carried almost 150,000 passengers across Europe, Asia and the United States. He added that Navya's next vehicle will look ""more like a robo-taxi.""Unlike the driverless trials from Uber and Alphabet's Waymo, which aim to bring autonomous vehicles to personal transport, a focus on self-driving public transit is a significantly easier challenge. That is because these autonomous vehicles are often limited to operating in the ""last mile,"" to existing public transit, or smaller distances on often well-traveled routes. That reduces the complexity required to make the machines navigate across an entire city.In London, city planners conducted a three-week trial in April involving a self-driving electric shuttle moving slowly around a well-defined three-mile route on mostly private roads. Nick Reed, the project's coordinator, said that by offering people autonomous connections to the British capital's existing transportation network, his team was helping the city to meet public demand without having to invest millions, if not billions, in traditional subways or buses.""London is a megacity, we want people to use the public transportation that is already there,"" said Mr. Reed, academy director at TRL, a transit consultant firm in charge of the two-year trial in London. ""If we can connect people through autonomous vehicles, it's a big plus.""Not all of the autonomous vehicles being tested for public transport in Europe are glamour-free.In December, Carlo Ratti, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, stood on the banks of a picturesque canal in Amsterdam to test his team's latest contraption: a driverless boat.The machine \xe2\x80\x94 painted bright orange and measuring less than two feet in length \xe2\x80\x94 darted swiftly between parked boats and a flock of ducks. Called the Roboat, the initial prototype was remote-controlled. Later versions are set to incorporate sensors and other technology to make the boat fully autonomous. The machines will eventually reach up to 16 feet in length.Mr. Ratti's goal is to bring a fleet of these driverless boats to the Dutch city by the end of the decade, where they will be used to ferry people and goods around Amsterdam's miles of canals. If everything goes to plan, the researcher also hopes the autonomous boats will be able to automatically dock with each other, creating on-demand bridges and walkways whenever necessary.""There are rivers and waterfronts in most cities, so the applications are quite wide,"" said Mr. Ratti, whose team is split between Amsterdam and Boston, where they use a university swimming pool to try out their latest version of the Roboat. ""Not many people have looked at self-driving boats.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/30/the-future-of-european-transit-driverless-and-utilitarian.html
61,Donald Trump's border wall: A progress report,Politics,30-05-2017,"VIDEO0:5100:51Donald Trump's border wall: A progress reportNews VideosMore than four months into his term, how close is President Donald Trump to making good on his signature promise to build a wall between the United States and Mexico?Let's take a look.More from NBC News: Portland mayor wants to cancel alt-right ralliesGermany's Merkel signals deepening rift with U.S. under Trump Mike Dubke, White House communications director, resigns after 3 months on jobHas construction begun?Doesn't look like it. On his fifth day in office, Trump ordered construction of the wall to begin using cash on hand.  ProPublica reported last month that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) had just $20 million in their coffers for the project, which isn't much when cost estimates for building a border wall range from $1 million to $21.6 million per mile.The border between the United States and Mexico is more than 1,900 miles, and there's already 694 miles of existing fence. CBP did not respond to inquiries about whether any stretch of new wall has been built, although there are no signs of any activity. Repairs to 40 miles of older fencing were approved in the 2017 funding bill passed earlier this month, but funds for the concrete barrier that so energized Trump's voters have yet to materialize.In March, CBP put out a call for proposals that asked for two different design options: the very solid, concrete type that Trump described on the trail, and the alternative-material, see-through wall favored by border experts. Finalists will be announced in June, and prototypes will be built shortly afterward.For the project to truly get off the ground, Trump needs to convince either Mexico or Congress to give him the cash. Few lawmakers in either party have said that funding for the wall is a priority.Is Mexico paying for the wall?During the campaign, Trump promised that Mexico would fund it up front. Now, the president says Mexico will eventually pay for the wall, so any money Congress allocates is just a temporary expenditure.But Mexico says nope.""Mexico, of course, will not pay,"" Mexican President Enrique Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto said in January, reiterating what he has said repeatedly for the last two years,  including to Trump directly during a campaign trail visit.The president insists the U.S. can force Mexico to pay, perhaps by taxing remittances \xe2\x80\x94 cash residents send from America to friends or relatives in Mexico. One Republican representative has suggested taxing all transfers between America and Latin countries,  NPR reported.The Border Wall Funding Act of 2017, introduced on March 30 by Alabama Republican Rep. Mike Rogers, would put a 2 percent tax on all person-to-person wire transfers to Mexico, the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean. Remittances are a big deal; $28.5 billion flows into Mexico every year in remittances.So, who is really going to pay for the wall?Taxpayers are expected to pick up the initial tab and, barring a reversal from Mexico or a remittance tax, likely in the long run, too.How much will it cost?No one knows for sure, in part because the CBP has yet to chose a design. The  Department of Homeland Security reportedly has estimated a wall would cost about $21.6 billion, not including maintenance, while Republican leader Mitch McConnell recently estimated it would cost up to $15 billion. Senate Democrats released a report last month estimating that it would cost about $70 billion to build, and $150 million a year to maintain.Federal records show that existing fencing built a decade ago cost between $1 million and $3.9 million per mile, with the costs widely varying due to terrain and fencing type. The president's 2018 budget proposal asks Congress for around $21.6 million per mile to build 74 miles of his wall.What will the wall look like?Trump promised voters ""a big, beautiful wall."" But it might not look like a wall at all. It might look more like the 694 miles of fencing already built.The CBP proposal requirements indicated that the wall would have to be at least 18 feet high and able to withstand significantly physical force, prevent climbing and tunneling and be aesthetically appealing on the American side.The Wall Street Journal obtained a slew of the sketches, including one Parthenon-inspired design as well as a double-wire mesh fence design that would offer Americans, but not Mexicans, visibility to the other side.There's some indication that fencing may indeed rule the day. Touting the funding secured to repair 40 miles of existing border fencing secured in the omnibus-spending bill Congress passed this month, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney showed images of 20-foot cyclone fencing and told reporters this kind of steel fencing might be the ""wall"" in the end.""This is the wall that DHS said they wanted, sat in the Oval Office with the president, we talked about bricks and mortar, we talked about concrete, and this is what they wanted,"" Mulvaney said, noting that the DHS believes see-through fencing is safer for border agents. ""It's also half of the cost, so we can build twice as much of it.""Who actually owns the border?This is where things get messy.Much of the nearly 2,000 mile-border is  owned by private citizens and businesses, whose property will be bought out from under them by the federal government armed with eminent domain laws that can force owners into deals.""Are people concerned about the federal government coming in and trying to grab their land? Yes, they are."" Texas Rep. Will Hurd told NBC News. The Republican congressman's district stretches 820 miles along the southern border. ""Private property rights are pretty damn important to us.""The last time the federal government built up fencing along the southern border with the Secure Fence Act of 2006, eminent domain laws were used to buy up a significant amount of land, often at a discount of the land's value.  A CNN investigation reviewed 442 lawsuits involving 678 property owners; the property owners all lost their land, though some cases remain open to this day. In the end, CNN reported, they expect it to cost more than $103 million to the taxpayer for the government to buy up 600 parcels of land and settle unresolved transactions and litigation expenses.The Trump administration is revving up for a similar fight. The Department of Justice requested $1.8 million for 2018, enough to staff 20 positions, including 12 attorneys, ""to meet litigation, acquisition, and appraisal demands during the construction along the border."" The department currently has just two attorneys and a budget of $329,000 for dealing with eminent domain issues.What about eminent domain?""I think  eminent domain is wonderful,"" Trump  told Fox News in 2015, breaking with much of his party, who see it as government abusing its power.As a businessman, he infamously used it to try and force an elderly widow to sell her property so he could build a parking lot for limousines. He lost the case.Will a wall deter illegal immigration?That's the multi-billion-dollar question.""Walls work, just ask Israel,"" the president said last week at a joint presser with the Colombian president, in his most recent public remarks about his signature promise to America. The administration is quick to note that illegal border crossings are down significantly this year.  DHS Secretary John Kelly credited this last month to ""confusion"" about how the new administration will handle immigrants, and the president's tough rhetoric on enforcing immigration laws.Critics say it's a really expensive way to secure the border, which could be more cheaply done with technology, border agents and fencing.""My goal is that when we look at border security, we do not have a one size fits all solution, we look at every mile of the border differently than we looked at the one before it,"" Hurd said.Existing fencing has not, so far, stopped immigrants from crossing the border. Existing fencing was breached 9,200 times between 2010 and 2015. The government itself says it has yet determine a way of measuring how effective segments of the border walls are at slowing or stopping illegal crossings.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/30/donald-trumps-border-wall-a-progress-report.html
62,City grandees strike increasingly sanguine Brexit tone ahead of UK general election,UK Election 2017,30-05-2017,"Gary Yeowell | The Image Bank | Getty ImagesThe British public has grown accustomed to dire warnings over the Square Mile's fate in a post-Brexit environment, told that the City will become smaller, poorer and less relevant to a global world. HSBC's Douglas Flint summarized the mood when he described U.K. financial services as a Jenga tower, potentially fatally undermined when a stray brick tumbles to Frankfurt or Paris.This made the tone of leading financiers at the annual City Week conference Thursday all the more remarkable, indicative of a broader sentiment shift that has swept across London in recent weeks. The Chairman of Lloyds Banking Group turned Flint's vivid metaphor on its head, telling the conference that: ""rather than a Jenga tower, I think of a Tower of London, with deep foundations."" Norman Blackwell went on to highlight the capital's legal expertise, talent pipeline and infrastructure as features that would safeguard its role as Europe's pre-eminent financial hub.Aberdeen's CEO Martin Gilbert struck a similar note on the panel, choosing to emphasize the fact large asset managers were arguably the sector best prepared for an EU divorce, with his firm already selling funds into Europe from a Luxembourg base. He went on to tell CNBC that while moving functions such as euro-clearing from the U.K. would mean job losses, ""this is not a hugely significant point\xe2\x80\xa6.. it may be a handful of jobs rather than anything more."" Catherine McGuinness, Chairman of the City of London Corporation, was equally bullish on jobs, stating that ""we are not detecting any great flood of people away from London.""VIDEO3:1703:17Exporting will be the way we survive and make a success of Brexit: CEOSquawk Box EuropeWhile a few C-suite comments can't mask the fact the bulk of the City is deeply concerned by its future services relationship with Europe, there has been a notable, broad sentiment improvement on the issue. Positioning is key to explaining this, as Joe Prendergast, Head of Financial Market Analysis at Credit Suisse, told CNBC the government's hard-line rhetoric on Brexit negotiations meant much of the downside risk is priced in.Positive developments, such as the snap election declaration that was widely viewed by traders as heightening prospects for a soft Brexit, have been strongly welcomed by a market conditioned to expect the worst. Sterling reflects this new mood, trading at 1.285 to the USD, up over 6 percent from mid-January's lows. Emmanuel Macron's comfortable victory in the French election has also helped sooth rattled nerves, with the prospect that the benign environment portrayed by the VIX can become reality as political risk subsides.However, two clouds linger over this less anguished Brexit view. The first is the political profile of the financiers championing it; Lord Blackwell has been a long term, lone advocate of a new European relationship, placing him firmly outside the City mainstream.VIDEO2:0702:07UK's Brexit negotiation with the EU has a tough road aheadSquawk Box AsiaMartin Gilbert is known to value cosy relations with government, throwing his weight behind May's Brexit stance earlier this year and cultivating relationship with both Alex Salmon and Nicola Sturgeon in Holyrood.Euro-clearing is the second shadow troubling this benign outlook with even the most Brussels loathing, EM pivoting City figures accepting that the issue remains a chink in London's Brexit armor. It is increasingly clear to the market that other EU members will try hard to keep euro-clearing inside the European Union.Many in Brussels have never been happy that the primary center developed outside the euro zone, with few foreseeing in the early 1990's the way the derivatives industry would exponentially expand. European regulators are also anxious for oversight given the systemic risk clearing houses can pose, brought into sharp focus for many bureaucrats in 2011 when the London based LCH suddenly raised margins on Portuguese and Irish debt, sparking further yield spikes in the midst of the euro zone crisis.Perhaps more comfort could be taken from the subtly more benign view the market and its leaders now advocate on Brexit if troublesome political leanings and daunting technicalities didn't remain in the way.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/30/city-grandees-strike-increasingly-sanguine-brexit-tone-ahead-of-uk-general-election.html

Stocks continue to be resilient no matter what quakes come out of Washington or how wobbly the economy looks.Investors on this holiday-shortened week will get a few key data points plus other glimpses into what is ahead. A June swoonJune is a historically meh kind of month for the market, with average returns for the  of just 0.7 percent. That puts it about in the middle of September's ugly 1.1 percent average loss and the robust 1.5 percent gains for July.This, however, has been no ordinary year. The market seems virtually oblivious to bad news, with investors capitalizing on even the smallest dips to rush back in and buy.A few nuggets to chew on as we come to the almost-halfway mark in the year: So far, 2017 has seen 17 new all-time closing highs for the S&P 500 and just 10 days where the index moved more than 1 percent in either direction. That kind of higher highs with low volatility always \xe2\x80\x94 yes, always \xe2\x80\x94 has been positive for the market, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.The previous 17 times that has happened, the market has averaged a 19.4 percent gain, with advances happening 100 percent of the time.So if you didn't sell in May and go away, you might not want to change your tune in June.All about the jobsGet ready for another exciting jobs report on Friday \xe2\x80\x94 investors are closely monitoring what's happening in the labor market.Economists are expecting May payrolls to grow by about 175,000, down from April's 211,000, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.4 percent according to FactSet. However, those aren't the main numbers the market will be watching.A ""now hiring"" sign is posted outside a store in San Francisco.Getty ImagesWhat will grab the most attention are the inflation-related indicators, particularly average hourly wages. Current expectations are for a modest 0.2 percent monthly rise.

If that begins to accelerate in response to a tighter labor market, that is some of the data on which the Fed is dependent,"" said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. ""If a genie appeared to me and said I will give you a perfectly clear crystal ball for any one data series the Fed is watching, I would choose the average hourly earnings report.""The market currently expects the Fed to hike its benchmark rate a quarter-point in June, and then to enact perhaps one more increase in December.Tuesday will be the second-biggest data day of the week when we'll find out a little more about inflation from the Personal Consumption Expenditures index.

66,Bitcoin is outperforming major assets but hedge funds are still staying away from the cryptocurrency,Tech Transformers,30-05-2017," hit an all-time high last week, marking a year-to-date rally of 180 percent and potentially stellar returns for those who bet on the cryptocurrency, but it appears hedge funds are still not ready to touch the asset class.The lighter supervision and more sophisticated client base enjoyed by hedge funds, as well as their ongoing search for market-beating alternative sources of return, provide just some reasons why such vehicles would be expected to venture more boldly into the booming but narrowly understood market for cryptocurrencies.Indeed, bitcoin's rally has far outpaced the , which is up 7.9 percent year-to-date, and the NASDAQ which has seen around a 15 percent rise. In the currency space, the euro has risen nearly 6 percent year-to-date against the dollar, while sterling is up around 4.2 percent. The euro and pound are the best performing major currencies so far this year. Yet aside from dedicated vehicles set up with a sole or majority focus on trading cryptocurrencies, many hedge funds are still very reluctant to dip a toe into the asset class.""To be honest, I just don't know enough about it,"" said a 16-year hedge fund portfolio manager veteran, who preferred to remain anonymous because he didn't want to publicly reveal investment strategy. This reflected the view of several people whom CNBC spoke to via phone and in person. Restrictive investment guidelines set internally was another reason cited by multiple managers.Hedge funds' reluctance to invest really boils down to concerns over volatility, security and perception, according to Louis Gargour, founder of alternative asset manager LNG Capital.VIDEO4:2504:25Here are three big risks to the bitcoin rally: TraderFast Money""Bitcoin's extreme volatility doesn't sit well with managers working on a risk-adjusted return basis. Furthermore, there are valid concerns that digital currency assets can be hacked or stolen. Finally, there's a perception that bitcoin remains a niche, retail investment that does not yet demonstrate sufficient quality to be seriously considered for many reputable institutions,"" says Gargour who has 25 years' of corporate bond experience and had experience at several of the biggest Wall Street names before starting his own fund.There's also the issue of reassuring investors, added Gargour, who says clients are vastly more comfortable with knowing their money is invested in tangible or institutionalized assets, such as gold or equities.A catalyst which could change the way cryptocurrencies are perceived and potentially open the floodgates for more hedge fund money is if the largest global banks provide services such as settlement for them.""Clearing banks need to adopt these crytocurrencies as payment methods to pique widespread institutional interest,"" suggested Gargour, adding that its ease of transfer could indeed make it a preferable alternative for banks to the cumbersome process of wiring money.With the firmer reassurance of such institutional backing, cryptocurrencies could then look more interesting to a broader investor base as potentially an alternative source of available credit risk.Rising investment interestDespite the current reluctance for hedge funds to get involved with bitcoin, there's a growing move to try to open up the cryptocurrency world to institutional investors. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, known for their lawsuit against Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, have been trying to get regulatory approval for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejected the initial application but is now reviewing the decision after an appeal. If such a product were approved, it could make bitcoin more palatable for hedge funds to invest.Chris Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFor now, there are ways to trade bitcoin through investment products. Companies like Global Advisors have a bitcoin fund that is listed on The International Stock Exchange on the Channel Islands (an archipelago in the English Channel), and Daniel Masters, a director at the company said that there has been rising interest from investors.Global Advisors also has two exchange-traded notes (ETNs) listed on the NASDAQ OMX in Sweden. These allow people to buy a product that tracks the bitcoin price. Masters said that there has been large interest from major brokers buying the ETN on behalf of clients, showing a rising interest in bitcoin investment products.""The interest is just going stratospheric,"" Masters told CNBC in a recent phone interview.""If you look at the brokers we are now getting to participate, it's coming from over a dozen different sources.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/30/bitcoin-price-hedge-funds-not-investing.html

68,Microsoft researchers are trying to humanize virtual assistants by studying multilingual speech,Tech,29-05-2017,"HYDERABAD, India \xe2\x80\x94 Voice-powered virtual assistants, underpinned by artificial intelligence, like Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Google Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana are becoming regular fixtures in people's lives. They're present at homes, on devices and watches and in cars, sending driving directions, weather updates, meeting reminders and the occasional joke or two when prompted.Beyond that, they remain limited in their ability to hold conversations with users, the same way real people might. Efforts are on, however, to use machine learning and real-time big data analytics to make virtual assistants understand multiple languages, accents, contexts and nuances to hold more human-like conversations. Drew Angerer | Getty ImagesInternational Data Corporation predicts global spending on cognitive and AI solutions will see significant investments over the next several years, and could achieve a compound annual growth rate of 54.4 percent through 2020.Microsoft, for example, is turning to an unlikely group to bridge the gap between human-machine interactions: bilinguals. Of specific interest is the practice of code-mixing, which is when speakers switch back and forth between multiple languages in a single sentence or conversation. It's commonly found in multilingual societies. A handful of Microsoft researchers in India started Project M\xc3\xa9lange, where they are studying the use of code-mixing among Indians online. They are trying to figure out how virtual assistants might be taught to respond to a user switching between, for example, English and Hindi in a conversation.""Compartmentalization of mixed languages (by multilinguals) have gone away with each coming generation,"" Kalika Bali, a researcher at Microsoft, told CNBC in an interview. ""So younger people use mixed languages in more and more phases of their lives.""""To have a digital assistant, something like Cortana, you have to be able to understand (the user base),"" she said, adding current systems weren't trained to pick up multiple languages in a single conversation.Microsoft's philosophy is that virtual assistants should not be too intrusive on a user's space and time, and only show up when they need to, Sundar Srinivasan, general manager of the AI division in India at Microsoft, said in a recent interview. Srinivasan's team works on Cortana and Microsoft's search engine Bing at the company's development center in Hyderabad.""A personal assistant is only as effective as you want her to be,"" he said.Cortana is available on Windows 10 and in selected smartphones running on the Windows operating software. It has about 140 million monthly active users versus about 500 million devices currently running Windows 10. The program is not available in many regions, but Srinivasan said Microsoft plans to expand it into other markets and onto more devices in the future.By comparison, Google Assistant is available on both Android and iOS platforms, which support about 99.8 percent of all smartphones in the world.Srinivasan explained that Cortana was not like other Microsoft products such as Office, where the company could add features as and when needed. Instead, Cortana ""needs to really understand human beings, and the bar for that is very high because that means we have to train the assistant with lots of human speech data,"" he said.""It's going to take us time.""Bali said the researchers' code-mixing study was inspired by observations from an anthropologist who was looking at the use of technology among Urdu-speaking youth in Hyderabadi slums. They were found using the internet to befriend and interact with girls from Brazil, who primarily spoke Portuguese. English, however, was the primary language for that communication, which piqued Bali's interest and she had asked to see the data collected by the anthropologist.""When I started seeing this data, I saw that not only were they using this very pidgin English kind of thing, but (they were) effectively communicating with each other,"" Bali said, referring to the type of code-mixing that was happening in these conversations.The team looks at every aspect of code-mixing, including text, speech, understanding and recognition. Bali said they also look at generational variations and why people switch between languages in a single conversation \xe2\x80\x94 for example, sometimes it's for humor and at other times it's to change topics.But it may take years before a voice-powered virtual assistant can eloquently switch back and forth in multiple languages to respond to users. The biggest challenge now for Bali and the researchers is getting access to adequate data sets for study.""Trying to solve just mono-lingual natural language processing and understanding has taken years. Now we're talking about mixed stuff and where are we going to get data from?"" Bali said. ""Because everything is data-driven. And what are we going to do? It just seemed like a very difficult problem to solve but we were all so excited about this that we just went on.""Currently, the team uses data collected from Twitter to study how users would switch between languages. Studies, Bali said, already showed Indian men who spoke English and Hindi tended to switch to the latter when they had to express negative sentiments or abuse. Women who are having a conversation in English, however, tended to stick with that language even when the content took a negative turn.Teaching machines to interpret code-mixing could also potentially lead to developments in areas of opinion mining, customization and a better interpretation of nuances and context, Bali said.""I think this would definitely help to bridge the gap in the human-computer interaction. The fact that you can actually talk to a machine the way you would normally talk to your friend is something we still need to wrap our heads around.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/29/microsoft-is-studying-multilingual-speech-to-humanize-virtual-assistants-like-cortana.html

The judge also struck down Navalny's motion to request the national property registry office to release the property deeds which he says prove the link.""If tens of thousands took to the streets in Moscow, then Medvedev needs to respond to this,"" Navalny told the court. ""Medvedev should be held responsible for this, not Usmanov.""Usmanov did not appear in court on Tuesday. Proceedings began cordially as Navalny snapped a selfie with Usmanov's attorney, Genrikh Padva, one of Russia's best known lawyers who used to represent former jailed oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky.Earlier this month the reclusive Usmanov released a YouTube video dismissing Navalny as a ""loser"" and concluded the 12-minute clip with ""I spit on you.""

The global economy is growing, the Fed and other central banks remain accommodative even though they are gradually tightening monetary policy, and there is a lack of ""excesses"" in pricing or sentiment.If anything, he believes market structure rather than fundamentals could prove the biggest issue ahead.""With all the technology and all these (exchange-traded funds) and quantitative systems that have been introduced, I do have concern that technology has outpaced the market's ability to handle it,"" Cooperman said. ""When we get into the next bear market, it could be a messy affair.""He also is advising against bonds.

72,Here's why the chances of a snap election in Italy are increasing considerably,Elections,30-05-2017,"PD Secretary Matteo Renzi attends the 'L'Arena' TV show at Cinecitta Studios on May 14, 2017 in Rome, Italy.The likelihood of Italy holding a general election by the fall has increased considerably, according to a political risk analyst, as lawmakers moved closer to an agreement on a new electoral system.""The biggest obstacle to early elections has so far been the lack of a workable electoral law\xe2\x80\xa6 yet after months of dithering, it seems that the main parties are edging towards an agreement to endorse a German-inspired electoral system, using proportional representation with a 5 percent threshold,"" Wolfango Piccoli, a political risk analyst at Teneo Intelligence in London, said in an email.Italy's four main political parties are set to begin discussions on the introduction of a new proportional voting system on Tuesday. The euro zone's third largest economy seems to be in favor of revamping its electoral system in order to mirror the so-called 'German model', whereby a 5 percent cut-off threshold would be introduced for smaller parties.While an agreement on a new electoral system seems to increase the likelihood of a weak coalition that would struggle to enact domestic reforms, it could trigger snap elections before a tough budget accentuates anti-EU sentiment among Italian voters.Should Italy's lawmakers reach a deal in June, it would effectively remove the biggest obstacle to the possibility of snap elections.Piccoli suggested talks between the main parties had raised the prospect of an early election ""considerably"" and estimated there was now a 45 percent chance Italian voters would be required to return to the ballot box by the fall.Voting with Germany 'makes sense for Europe'Michal Fludra | NurPhoto via Getty ImagesFormer Prime Minister Matteo Renzi argued Italy holding an election in September, at the same time as Germany votes to elect a new premier, would ""make sense"" from a European perspective.""Voting with Berlin would make sense for many reasons on a European level, and would allow the new parliament to set five years of economic policy without losing a day,"" Renzi told Il Messaggero in an interview published on Sunday.Renzi, having regained the leadership of the center-left Democratic Party (PD) in April, said he would not fight for early elections but described himself as unafraid of the possibility. President Sergio Mattarella is the solitary figure in Italian politics with the power to dissolve parliament and has previously said elections would only be held in the country after a new electoral system had been passed.""Renzi has apparently given up his preference for a majoritarian electoral law (which, at least on paper, would have yielded greater stability and better governance) in exchange for snap polls,"" Teneo's Piccoli added.The Florence born politician, previously dubbed the ""demolition man"" for his ambitious reformist policies, had stepped down as prime minister in December after a jarring constitutional referendum defeat. In an apparent contrast to his self-titled ""modernizer"" approach to Italian politics, Renzi warned that even if the four major political parties could agree on a new German-inspired electoral law, the possibility of a coalition in power would be ""very risky"".The latest opinion polls put Renzi's PD party neck-and-neck with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (5SM) party, which has made Italy the biggest risk for the euro zone in the eyes of investors.Amid reports Rome could be on course to call an early election in September, Italy's 5 and 10-year bond yields fell to their lowest level in five months.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/30/heres-why-the-chances-of-a-snap-election-in-italy-are-increasing-considerably.html

And that, he said, is where bitcoin comes in.""Governments are potentially having long-term issues with debt repayment, and the world is suffering so much debt. Maybe the world needs an alternative \xe2\x80\x94 in the sense that [bitcoin] is an asset-backed currency with limited supply,"" he told CNBC's ""Capital Connection"" on Tuesday.Preiss said he believes the technology backing bitcoin has the potential to go beyond financial markets, into a new social structure, with the fourth industrial revolution and developments in artificial intelligence.With the rise of populism, he said, it is evident that trust is becoming less prevalent in society globally. As the current social contract appears to fray at the seams, a network-based decentralized system, such as bitcoin, has increasing potential.Bitcoin is already occupying a considerable position in global financial markets, according to Preiss. ""Bitcoin's market capitalization overtook Deutsche Bank just as of last week, so that shows you how to some extent the world and things are changing,"" he said.While Japan recently legalized the cryptocurrency for retail transactions, which was one of the reasons cited behind its surge to an all-time high last week, other countries remain skeptical. China's central bank has cracked down on its domestic bitcoin market and has warned against risks and volatility.The demand for cryptocurrency in this month's Wannacry ransomware attack further raised skepticism about investing in it as a mainstream security.Preiss said concerns about the use of bitcoin in illegal activities are valid, but he compared it to the U.S. dollar to explain how not all cryptocurrency is bad. The dollar is the most common medium for criminal transactions, but it wouldn't make sense to shun that currency, he said.Moreover, Preiss said bitcoin transactions are actually traceable because of the publicly viewable blockchain technology on which it runs.""The question that always comes is: Is it a currency?"" he said. ""Well that's maybe too limiting \xe2\x80\x94 it's much more than that, it's actually a token. It's distributed trust and distributed consensus.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/30/bitcoin-could-help-the-world-says-investor.html
74,Some venture capitalists are prioritizing mental health -- and are willing to pay for therapy,Tech,30-05-2017,"Jetta Productions | Getty ImagesSilicon Valley investors are starting to take the mental health of start-up executives quite seriously.Venture firms including Refactor Capital and Slow Ventures have agreed to pick up the tab for portfolio company founders to get an initial visit to a therapist. They're offering an option via a startup called Kip, which provides a curated list of therapists online.Once users book a session, they see the therapist in-person. Kip is currently available in San Francisco. Erin Frey, the company's founder, said Kip wants to work with entrepreneurs to demonstrate the benefits of mental health services.""This is a low-cost way to ensure you have a high-performing executive team,"" Frey said. ""Think of all the money that is spent on things like Macbooks, compared to dealing with anxiety, stress and depression."" Kip's therapists charge a flat rate of $165 per session and do not take insurance. Kip keeps about 25 percent of the fee.Approximately one in five Americans face a mental illness each year, according to the National Alliance of Mental Illness. Across the country, policymakers and advocates are questioning whether the Trump Administration will prioritize mental health care as it aims to slash spending and revamp the health system.Meanwhile, in Silicon Valley, founders are increasingly speaking out about burnout and emotional toll of entrepreneurship. Founders are encouraged to speak confidently about their businesses in pitch meetings, rather than to open up about their weaknesses or challenges.Zal Bilimoria, Refactor's managing director, said the therapy sessions are the ""right thing to do,"" and they also maximize a company's chances of success.""All founders face challenges in building and running their companies,"" Bilimoria said.Frey said that Kip captures ""data between sessions,"" so health providers can track how their clients are progressing. That data is self-reported, but in the future, Frey hopes to incorporate data from wearable health trackers.Unlike most mental health startups, Kip's sessions don't take place via a video consultation. The reason for that, Frey said, is that it can be challenging for therapists to pick up on subtle cues, like fidgeting under the table. Many of the providers specialize in cognitive behavioral therapy, which tends to be short-term, as well as goal-oriented.Frey said founders should start to see their mental health as a priority.""We hope this is one way to fight the stigma,"" she said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/30/venture-capitalists-are-paying-for-mental-health-services-like-kip.html

But U.S. consumers remain optimistic on the whole.  The index now stands at 117.9, down from its April reading, the group said. Economists were expecting the index to drop slightly to 119.8 for the month of May, according to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates. The Consumer Confidence Index last fell to 120.3 in April after hitting 125.6 in March, its highest level since December 2000.""Consumer confidence decreased slightly in May, following a moderate decline in April,"" Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, said in a statement. ""However, consumers' assessment of present-day conditions held steady, suggesting little change in overall economic conditions. Looking ahead, consumers were somewhat less upbeat than in April, but overall remain optimistic that the economy will continue expanding into the summer months.""Economists closely monitor the mood of consumers because their spending makes up about 70 percent of U.S. economic activity.Those individuals saying business conditions are ""good"" edged down from 30.8 percent to 29.4 percent in May, but those saying business conditions are ""bad"" was unchanged at 13.7 percent, The Conference Board said.

76,Trump misses a key point when he urges the Senate to blow up its rules,Politics,30-05-2017,"VIDEO2:5902:59Spicer: Trump wants to see bills move through CongressPower LunchPresident Donald Trump's call to end the filibuster in the Senate misses a big point: Republicans can already pass tax reform and Obamacare replacement bills without a single Democratic vote. On Tuesday, the president tweeted that the Senate ""should switch to 51 votes immediately"" to ""get health care and TAX CUTS approved, fast and easy."" He presumably means changing rules to scrap the use of the legislative filibuster, which requires 60 votes for a bill to advance. Trump tweet:  The U.S. Senate should switch to 51 votes, immediately, and get Healthcare and TAX CUTS approved, fast and easy. Dems would do it, no doubt!Press secretary Sean Spicer expanded on the tweet Tuesday afternoon, saying Trump has had ""long-standing"" concerns and ""frustration"" with the pace of the Senate and wants to see ""action."" He also said that Senate Democrats have obstructed and delayed many of Trump's nominations, though their ability to do so is limited.Trump and Spicer both did not address a critical part of the health-care and tax-reform processes: The Senate already has the ability to pass both bills with a majority vote. The GOP is using a process known as budget reconciliation in trying to pass bills to overhaul the Affordable Care Act and the tax system. Through reconciliation, the party can approve its plans with only a majority vote in the Senate, in which it controls 52 of 100 seats. Democrats have so far shown no enthusiasm about joining in with Republicans on plans that would repeal parts of the ACA or chop tax rates for wealthy Americans. While Republicans can pass both proposals without a Democrat supporting them, the GOP has struggled to reach a quick consensus on either issue. The American Health Care Act, the House GOP plan to replace Obamacare, was pulled from the floor in March as the party failed to muster enough support to pass it. It got approved early this month by a narrow 217 to 213 vote after a series of amendments to appease both conservative and moderate Republicans. Still, key GOP senators have signaled the plan they will craft will have major differences from the House proposal. The Senate may not pass a bill as quickly as Trump wants, either.""I don't know how we get to 50 (votes) at the moment. But that's the goal,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told Reuters last week. The pace of tax-reform passage has led to doubts about how quickly the tax plan will pass, as well. Republicans have signaled that they want to pass a health-care bill before they move on to tax reform. The Trump administration initially set an August goal for passing a tax overhaul, but has since pushed the timeline to sometime this year. Still, Spicer said Tuesday that the administration has seen ""progress"" in crafting a tax reform plan with congressional leaders.

""They want it to be memorable and part of the local scene, not like they are tourists.""The moves are also an extension of a trend where hotels are moving away from a uniform experience, no matter where they are, to one in which properties blend into their communities and offer travelers access to local artists and businesses.Hotel operators already have a trove of data about the preferences and behavior of their frequent guests, said Bjorn Hanson, a professor at the Jonathan M. Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism at New York University. Now, he said, the hotels are using that data to get travelers to spend more money when they visit. ""Growth is slowing, so they have to shift their model to target more spending"" per guest, he said.Last year, Airbnb started its own Trips booking site, on which local ""experts"" sell experiences they put together, like a seven-hour day working and dining in an urban garden with a Los Angeles documentary filmmaker, or a three-day burlesque dancing class in London, complete with a workshop on making nipple tassels.TripAdvisor, the online travel booking site, bought Viator three years ago.

87,This blame game is driving up health insurance costs,Health Insurance,30-05-2017,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) speaks during a media briefing on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC.Joshua Roberts | ReutersThe Senate is taking baby steps toward a health care bill amid serious disagreement among lawmakers. But the health care industry waits for no one, and insurers are growing increasingly rattled by a combination of inaction in Congress and outright threats of sabotage from the White House.Customers could  soon be paying the price.Insurance companies, which are reaching deadlines to submit premiums for the individual health care market and to decide whether to sell policies at all, say the uncertainty is driving their premiums higher and their participation lower. These complaints come on top of existing problems in Obamacare markets that would have demanded attention if Democrats had won.More from NBC News:Portland mayor wants to cancel alt-right ralliesGermany's Merkel signals deepening rift with U.S. under Trump Mike Dubke, White House communications director, resigns after 3 months on jobRegardless of what lawmakers do in the long run, the  time may have already passed for Congress to rescue the 2018 insurance market from the negative effects of the current debate. Insurers are putting in their initial bids for premiums and will finalize their plans in September. That means even a temporary fix would likely fail to shield customers from the effects of uncertainty.""We needed to have the answers three months ago,"" Bob Laszewski, president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates, a consulting firm in Washington, D.C., told NBC News.With the market rapidly reaching a point of no return, the political fight in Washington could shift from the future of health care to which party is to blame for its present.The costs of uncertaintyLast week, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina announced that it would seek a 22.9 percent increase in premiums for 2018 plans. But it pointedly added that the hike would be just 8.8 percent if Congress and the Trump administration guaranteed subsidies that they're owed for paying out-of-pocket costs for low-income customers.The company also reserved the right to withdraw entirely because of the ""undecided future"" of the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare.In other states, insurers are already pulling out of the market. When Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City withdrew, it left 25 counties without an insurer and many others with only one. In announcing the move, the company cited major losses of more than $100 million but also the ""uncertain direction"" of the market.President Donald Trump has repeatedly hinted that he might cut off the cost-sharing payments, which are the subject of a House Republican lawsuit against the Obama administration, as a way to  put political pressure on Democrats.America's Health Insurance Plans, or AHIP, the nation's leading insurance lobby, has demanded that the White House and Congress resolve the subsidies immediately \xe2\x80\x94 or take the blame for hurting consumers.""This uncertainty is arguably the single most destabilizing factor in the individual market, and millions of Americans could soon feel the impact of fewer choices, higher costs, and reduced access to care,"" Cathryn Donaldson, a spokeswoman for AHIP, said in an email.Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, has urged lawmakers to address the issue.""Those subsidies are not only important to stabilize the insurance markets, but they're absolutely vital to low-income individuals,"" she told NBC News.But others see any fallout as the Democrats' fault for drafting their bill improperly, which is the basis of the lawsuit: Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming, blamed former President Barack Obama for ""making illegal payments"" when asked about the recent insurer news.The situation is growing turbulent enough that Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, told NBC News that he could support separate legislation to shore up markets while Congress works on a full Obamacare replacement.""If we have to break this and do something short term to stabilize the markets, I would support that,"" Johnson said.But Johnson added that his take ""may be a minority view"" within the Republican Party, which is uneasy with any move perceived as bolstering the Obamacare framework. Given Trump's discussion of using failing insurance markets as a political cudgel against Democrats, the president could also veto such an effort.Blame gamePolicy experts say the cost-sharing subsidies are only one of many factors upsetting the markets. Insurers are also concerned that the White House might decline to enforce the individual mandate or refuse to adequately advertise during enrollment periods, something that happened briefly after the inauguration.Then there are the many variables in Congress: AHIP and some insurance executives criticized the House bill that passed in May, and there are few clues as to how the Senate will respond, or when, or whether it will be able to get legislation to the president's desk at all.""Republicans haven't really done anything to signal that the non-group market will ever become a viable business proposition,"" said Joe Antos, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.Finally, there's Obamacare's own problems.In many places, the insurance markets have attracted more sick customers and fewer healthy customers than had been hoped. Even before Trump took office, there was a rash of premium hikes averaging 25 percent nationwide this year, as well as a major decline in the number of available plans, although no counties were left with zero options.Obamacare's subsidies made up the difference for many customers, but those whose incomes were too high to qualify have faced steep new costs.The stew of factors muddies responsibility and has left each party rushing to tar the other with negative headlines.""Obamacare is collapsing under its own weight, and BCBS [Blue Cross/Blue Shield] itself is leaving Kansas and Missouri as a consequence,"" a White House spokesman said. ""The rising costs of health care predate the Trump administration.""Republicans were quick last week to bring up the North Carolina and Missouri news as evidence that Obamacare needed to be replaced.""This plan simply hasn't worked, it isn't working, and it is going to get worse before it gets better,"" Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, said in a floor speech.But Democrats were eager to bring up the news, as well. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York spoke on the floor warning of Republican ""sabotage"" and predicted that his rivals would face the wrath of voters if they tried to pawn off responsibility.""When people get a  bad health care bill, you can blame anyone you want,"" he said last week. ""You are in charge.""Looking to seize the legislative high ground, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, introduced a bill that would allow people in counties that lack insurers to access the same exchange plans as members of Congress.""I knew that the president had expressed his desire to sabotage people's insurance coverage, so I anticipated that this would happen,"" she said, referring to the pullout of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City. The measure, she said, ""is an immediate fix, and we ought to get an immediate vote.""The state of playDespite Obamacare's ongoing struggles, outside analysts said the exchanges appeared to be in better shape earlier this year as insurers adjusted their prices to meet the environment.Sabrina Corlette, a professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University who has been tracking insurers' quarterly earnings, said companies' comments to shareholders have grown more upbeat even as they warn that uncertainty in Washington raises new risks.""There's probably some blame on all sides, but my perspective is that while many carriers faced significant challenges in the rollout of Obamacare's marketplaces, things were starting to stabilize financially,"" she said.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reached somewhat similar conclusions in its evaluation of the House health care bill last week.Buried in the report, the CBO assessed that the markets should be ""stable in most areas"" in the absence of any changes. But the agency added that ""several factors could lead insurers to withdraw from the market \xe2\x80\x94 including lack of profitability and substantial uncertainty about enforcement of the individual mandate and about future payments of the cost-sharing subsidies.""There's also the question of whether the Republican plan would address the growing consumer difficulties on the insurance market. The House bill would cover 23 million fewer people while raising out-of-pocket costs for many customers and hiking premiums for older low-income Americans, according to the CBO.Democrats, for their part, have suggested a variety of alternative fixes. headlined by a public insurance option, but there's little sign that the two parties would cooperate without a major shift in the political landscape.""We're not going to waste our time talking to people who have no interest in fixing the problem,"" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said last week.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/30/this-blame-game-is-driving-up-health-insurance-costs.html

89,June swoon not in the forecast for summer stock market,Market Insider,30-05-2017,"VIDEO4:4804:48Closing Bell Exchange: Need a more broad-based rallyClosing BellIt's more likely stocks will take a pause and move sideways this summer than roll over in a ""June swoon,"" according to a number of strategists.June is on average a flattish month and the fourth worst in terms of S&P 500 performance, but it also marks the start of the weak summer season for equities. September is historically the worst month and August the second worst, followed by February.""It's very possible this market is range bound for the summer. If we don't get a significant amount of upside in earnings or the second quarter ends up being a little less strong than the first quarter, or if there are people distracted by politics, or there is a little bit of market fatigue, it's possible we are range bound,"" said Kate Moore, chief equity strategist at BlackRock. ""But I have a hard time, from valuation or sentiment perspectives, seeing reasons for a big swoon.""Stocks have moved higher without regard for the type of events that might normally trip up the market. The controversies swirling around President Donald Trump's campaign and Russia; Federal Reserve rate hikes; and a potentially stalled out congressional effort on tax reform are not seen as impediments to the stock market, which could grind slowly higher.""The magnitude and duration of sell-offs more recently has been very disappointing to the bears,"" said Moore. She said the economic and earnings fundamentals are the bigger catalysts behind the stock market's move.""Earning are very strong in the first quarter. Companies did a good job of reaffirming or improving on the outlook for 2017,"" Moore said. ""This is really not contingent on significant policy stimulus coming out of D.C. ... People were trying to explain away the pickup in business sentiment after the election with great expectations for tax reform and stimulus. But at this point, management teams are just as aware of the extended delays in this policy reform.""Wednesday is the final trading day of May, and the  on pace for its sixth positive month out of seven and its best-performing month since February. Nasdaq, up 2.6 percent for May so far, was on pace for a seventh month of gains, its best winning streak since May 2013.Seasonally, June stock markets have traded lower just under half the time, but the losses have been minuscule \xe2\x80\x94 averaging a 0.005 percent decline in the S&P 500 all the way back to World War II, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. ""Despite the rhyme, stocks generally just mark time,"" Stovall said of the June swoon. ""June has the second-worst frequency of advances. However, the average price change is basically nonexistent.""June also follows the month of May, which has has often heralded in weakness, and is known for the old adage, ""sell in May."" However, the S&P 500 has gained more than 1.2 percent in May so far and was very near it's all-time high in Tuesday trading.Despite the market's quiet climb higher, some strategists do see risks. China's debt bubble is noted as one, but it's not a new risk. Some strategists say the market could react if Congress looks unlikely to pass tax reform this year, but how much the market is still counting on a plan in 2017 is up for debate. ""Trump came in with high expectations and has done nothing but be a disappointment,"" said investment strategist James Paulsen, formerly with Wells Capital Management. ""The market has no expectation for anything to be done this year. It may be a positive surprise if they actually get something done.""Strategists also say the Federal Reserve could eventually pose a problem for the market if the economic data do not pick up, and the Fed is seen as moving ahead with interest rate hikes in a soft economy. The central bank has forecast two rate increases and expects to begin the process of shrinking its balance sheet this year. Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan reiterated that forecast Tuesday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" and the market expects the next interest rate hike June 14.""The thing is there are not a lot of risks out there that are identifiable. If the Fed raises rates, they're boosting them to around 1 percent, and normally in this kind of inflationary environment, we should be at 3.5 percent. So the Fed is being extraordinarily accommodative,"" said Stovall.  Strategists say the market has also been lifted by strong U.S. earnings growth and a synchronized global economic recovery, but it is at a high valuation level and that could keep the market from rising much more.""As retail flows continue to move out of U.S. equities and into international equities, led byEurope and EM, SPX [S&P 500] upside following a stronger-than-expected Q1 earnings seasonappears capped heading into the historically quieter summer months,"" wrote Julian Emanuel, UBS equities and derivatives strategist, in a note.One concern for the market has been the concentrated gains in a handful of tech names. The  is up more than 7.5 percent for the year so far,  but the ""FANG"" stocks are up much more than that. One of those, Amazon. com broke the psychological $1,000 mile marker Tuesday, and is up 33 percent for the year so far. The other stocks in ""FANG"" are Facebook, Netflix and Alphabet, parent of Google.""FANG is leading the market, but in general the proportion of the market being led by technology is not greater than the normal proportion of the lead sector in other up years. You generally get a third of the performance in the equity market from the strongest sector in a year when the market advances,"" said Moore.Trump could also become a risk if his threats about trade become hard stances, said Paul Christopher, chief international investment strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.Christopher is of the view there could be a summer sell-off. He said he expects the market to peak soon, and a catalyst could be disappointment with Washington on the policy front, the Federal Reserve's rate hikes, or a political unknown.""We think the market is ignoring the valuations. The fact we expect more Fed rate hikes, and into 2018. At some point they have to be dealt with,"" he said. ""Maybe we just readjust back to more average P/Es."" The price-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 was 17.6 for 12-month forward earnings.

90,Lee Cooperman: My Settlement with the SEC,Halftime Report,30-05-2017,"I appreciate this opportunity to discuss my recently settled case with the SEC and my stock market outlook. What I hope to accomplish here this morning is, first and foremost, to highlight the abusive nature of the agency's enforcement practices and, in doing so, attempt in my small way to spur changes in the way cases like mine are pursued. My gripe is with the process, which is wantonly and unnecessarily destructive.As you are aware, I have entered into a ""no admit / no deny"" settlement, which prohibits me from commenting on the government's allegations or the strength of my defenses. I believe that the outcome speaks for itself. So today, let's focus on the process. I hope the new Chairman of the SEC, Jay Clayton, is watching today, because he is the one individual best positioned to effect changes in that process. I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well.Let's discuss the background and facts:We received the original subpoena from the SEC in March 2015. Through our attorneys, we informed the SEC that if they withdrew the subpoena, we would meet with them voluntarily and answer all their questions, and that if they weren't satisfied with our answers, they could reinstate the subpoena. They refused.Over the course of the next 18 months or so, with the subpoena hanging over our heads while the government took its time reviewing our document production, my business bled investor assets because of the anxiety occasioned by the subpoena \xe2\x80\x93 something that the government didn't seem to care about. Then, in September 2016, the SEC filed suit, and between then and the settlement, a total of about $4 billion in assets left the firm. Now, let's understand what that means in dollars and cents. With a 1-1/2 and 20 fee structure, that's about $140 million per year of lost income. That is less relevant to me than to the 40-odd Omega personnel who saw a starkly diminished earning opportunity that impacted themselves and their families.As you know, I am a signer of the Buffett/Gates Giving Pledge. At the time I did so, I told Warren Buffett that asking for one-half of one's wealth wasn't asking for enough, as I subscribe to the sentiment of Andrew Carnegie, who more than a century ago famously said, ""The man who dies rich, dies disgraced."" I have a number of charitable involvements, with my signature activity being Cooperman College Scholars, a program I founded and underwrite that identifies talented but needy students in Essex County high schools, helps them navigate their ways to college, pays a substantial amount toward their college tuition, and provides support during college to help ensure that they don't fall by the wayside before reaching their academic goal. My initial objective was to serve up to 500 youngsters in this way. With what the SEC cost me, I could have increased that number to 2,500. This is meaningful, because the average lifetime earnings of a college graduate are more than $1 million over those of a non-college graduate.Shortly before charges were filed, the SEC's original ask in settlement talks included a five-year industry bar, which at my age would effectively have ended my career, and an $8 million fine, which in combination with the bar would have been construed by many people as an admission of wrongdoing. We rejected the offer, the government filed, and we proceeded to prepare for trial.About six or seven months later, the government came to us with a new ask \xe2\x80\x93 no bar, no admit / no deny, and a $4.9 million payment. I'm not permitted to speculate on what might have caused this about-face, so I'll leave it to your viewers to infer what they will. But I would like to ask the SEC: ""What did you learn between your initial settlement offer and your final settlement offer that caused you to change your position so radically? Since I would have accepted your final offer had it been on the table initially, and in the interim you destroyed my business, this question is a matter of more than idle curiosity for me.""I now had to make a decision of going to trial or settling. I was advised that going to trial could cost me another $15-20 million in legal and expert-witness fees and remain a distraction, while continuing to cause my investors anxiety, and that the smart move was to settle. Though highly conflicted, I was convinced in the end to accede to their logic.If the SEC had originally asked for what we settled for in the end, I would have accepted, knowing the damage that the lingering uncertainty would do to my business and to the lives of my colleagues. By the time we settled, the damage had already been done.Forget for a moment about Omega and Lee Cooperman. Let's talk about the legendary Hank Greenberg, a war hero and philanthropist who founded AIG and built it into the world's most profitable insurance company. Twelve years ago, the New York State Insurance Commission went after him and, to get the matter behind, him, he offered a settlement of $16 million to resolve the case. They rejected his offer, asking instead for billions. He refused, over the next 12 years spent about $100 million in legal fees \xe2\x80\x93 God only knows how much taxpayer money the Insurance Commission squandered fighting him \xe2\x80\x93 and they ended up settling for $9 million, $7 million less than he originally offered. I'm not a fool. I know the State Insurance Commission is not the SEC. But where Hank's case and mine meet is on the battlefield of abusive enforcement processes that appear to be running amok at taxpayers' expense.In the end, the government pays no price for what they do. The taxpayer foots the bill; the government enjoys sovereign immunity, so I can't sue them; and the damage they inflicted cannot be undone, though I'm committed to doing my best to try. Unlike the United Kingdom, our legal system doesn't mandate that the losing party pays. This is simply wrong and has to be changed.I can now understand what was going through the mind of Ronald Reagan's former Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan, the first sitting cabinet officer to be indicted, who was charged in the 1980's on state charges of fraud and grand larceny. When he and his co-defendants were acquitted at trial of all charges, this is what he said: ""It's a cruel thing they did to me. The question is, should this indictment have ever been brought? What office do I go to, to get my reputation back? Who will reimburse my company for the economic jail it has been in for two and a half years?"" Different office of a different government, but Secretary Donovan's questions are just as relevant today, in my case and others like it, as they were 30 years ago.I feel very comfortable about my reputation, but I don't feel good about the process.Despite all this and the loss of assets under management that it occasioned, the Omega organization remains vibrant. Our senior investment team, as well as our senior operating, legal, compliance, accounting, database management, technology, trading, and investor relations teams, remain virtually intact.

91,"Global real estate booms again, and the big housing bargains are outside the US",Global Investing Hot Spots,30-05-2017,"After years of being hammered, housing prices in Europe \xe2\x80\x94 and Asia, too \xe2\x80\x94 are finally surging.And they're rising faster than in the United States, where the housing market has been hot, even in faraway places like Iceland.Residential properties stand on the city skyline in Reykjavik, Iceland.Arnaldur Halldorsson | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesYet investors are mostly sticking to equities that invest in the U.S. residential housing market, which is a microcosm of the provincial approach investors take when it comes to investing in stocks. And at a time when investors are flocking to international equity bets overall as a way to find better valuations than in the U.S. market.With international real estate, investors are forsaking big income bets, giving up higher yields and better returns at a lower price-to-earnings ratio. Last year 18 of the 23 European housing markets boomed, according to the research firm Global Property Guide, and show no signs of slowing. New Zealand, China and Canada were also strong.""There is a real opportunity here,"" said Duncan Rolph, a managing partner at Miracle Mile Advisors in Los Angeles. ""International real estate funds are priced less than U.S. [funds]. Yet they pay dividends over 4 percent.""The Vanguard Global ex-US Real Estate ETF (VNQI) fund is the best example. The fund currently has a 12-month yield of 4.58 percent, according to Morningstar, and has notched a price return of 12.12 percent as of May 19. And the expense ratio is a measly 0.15 percent.Price to prospective earnings ratios of real estate ETFs Vanguard Global ex-US Real Estate: 13.45 iShares International Developed Property: 14.35 iShares Europe Developed Real Estate: 12.40 WisdomTree Global ex-US Real Estate: 12.54 WisdomTree Global ex-US Hedged Real Estate: 12.59  Guggenheim China Real Estate: 10.24Vanguard REIT ETF (U.S.): 34.17(Source: Morningstar, data through 4/30/2017)Most of the fund's $4.2 billion in assets are invested in developed markets in Asia and Europe. Japan, where housing prices in Tokyo rose 9.3 percent last year, is the largest country holding. By contrast, the massive $33.8 billion US-centric Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ) price is nearly flat. ""There's a lot of room for funds to flow internationally,"" Rolph said.This low-risk Vanguard Global real estate fund is a favorite, said Todd Rosenbluth, senior director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. ""You're getting global diversification in developed markets,"" he said. ""And many holdings in it are attractively valued."" He doesn't rely on price-to-earnings metrics for this view, but generally noted that a bottom-up view of stock investing leads CFRA to be positive on broadly-based VNQI. More from Global Investing Hot Spots:China's big investment in SpaceX competitors 21st-century utopias to house 100 million The billionaire who is saving BethlehemThe nearly identical iShares International Developed Property ETF (WPS) has similar holdings to Vanguard Global ex-US. But assets are only $137 million and the expense ratio is higher at 0.48 percent. ""You're getting similar country exposure at a higher cost,"" Rosenbluth said.He suggested the iShares Europe Developed Real Estate (IFEU) ETF as a better alternative. It yields less at 2.5 percent, but it has had a 13.3 percent price increase this year. Most of the holdings are in the U.K., France and Germany, which provides a contrast to the Asia-centric real estate ETFs, Rosenbluth said. It's also relatively rare to find a European sector focus in ETFs. ""If investors believe there's a rebound there, this is a good way to play it,"" he added.VIDEO1:4301:43Why do Chinese house prices keep rising?Capital ConnectionThe WisdomTree Global ex-US Real Estate ETF (DRW) has an even more appealing yield of 5.2 percent. It's much smaller \xe2\x80\x94 $80 million in assets \xe2\x80\x94 and the expense ratio is higher at 0.58 percent. But the fund has notched a 16.5 percent return so far this year.The fund also has a few compelling twists, say experts. Though Hong Kong is the top country holding, nearly one-quarter of fund assets are invested in emerging markets like Mexico and South Africa. And the fund index is dividend-weighted based on real estate company cash payouts. These companies have $1 billion-plus market capitalizations. Country exposure is capped at 25 percent.""We build our own index,"" said Chris Gannatti, associate director of research at WisdomTree Asset Management. ""And so we think about diversification and liquidity.""As governments in India and elsewhere become more stable, investors should think about transitioning outside the US, he said.There's also the WisdomTree Global ex-US Hedged Real Estate ETF (HDRW). It yields 5.19 percent. ""The benefit is that it protects against currency downsides,"" Rosenbluth said. However, he adds, assets are only $2.7 million, meaning it's much less liquid as a trading vehicle than the other options in this space.In the Asian market, China housing prices in Shanghai rose an eye-popping 21.3 percent last year. And the Guggenheim China Real Estate ETF (TAO) has had a blowout year so far, too, rising 22.8 percent. But Neena Mishra, director of ETF Research at Zacks Investment Research, worries that China real estate is in a bubble. ""There's a lot of speculation in China real estate,"" she adds. ""So be apprehensive.""Rosenbluth said that CFRA analysts who cover many Chinese real estate stocks locally have sell recommendations on some in the ETF, including Henderson Land Development and China Overseas Land, both of which are top 10 holdings in TAO. While theses stocks have low P/E ratios, just like TAO, Rosenbluth said investors should also look at cash-flow metrics \xe2\x80\x94 the REIT industry uses funds from operations (FFO). Last week Moody's downgraded China's credit rating based on the risk that there will be too much debt used to fuel the economy as China's growth rate slows.""There are better places to invest,"" Rosenbluth said, adding that investors are paying a high price of 0.70 percent annually for the fund. He pointed back to VNQI, which is a much broader way to invest in global real estate that includes exposure to China but does not concentrate its bets there.Mishra said analysts usually prefer to use cash flow and capitalization rates to value REIT stocks rather than P/E ratios alone. And there are many other factors that will influence price swings in specific markets around the globe. Currency is one: the British pound's fall after Brexit led to a rise in Chinese purchases of London properties since those properties became much cheaper in yuan. Macroeconomic policy also plays a big role: Japanese REITs may continue to go up due to massive purchases by the Bank of Japan and ultra-low interest rates, even though they look expensive.""I think the main reason why investors should consider adding some international real estate exposure in their portfolios is the diversification benefits,"" Mishra said.Rosenbluth said investors should consider making a move into global real estate funds because, ""Prices are moving higher."" \xe2\x80\x94 By Constance Gustke, special to CNBC.com",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/30/biggest-real-estate-price-bargains-in-world-are-not-homes-in-us.html

The video was taken at a staff meeting in Seattle in February, Business Insider said. In the video, Schultz tells employees that there is ""a tremendous amount of pressure and anxiety in America."" He goes on to speculate that these feelings are hurting consumer behavior. Schultz went on to tell employees that the coffee chain can provide ""an antidote"" by providing a ""sense of community"" to its customers. Starbucks replied to a request for comment and confirmed the remarks captured.""We can confirm that these comments were made by then-CEO Howard Schultz during a private meeting at the Starbucks Support Center in Seattle with our business leadership team on February 17,"" Starbucks said in an email to CNBC.""It's important to note the timing of these comments, as they were made over three months ago and were centered around the sensitivity required for success in the retail business during that period of time. Also important to understand the full context for this comment as Howard also said: 'We have an antidote. We always have. And that's the sense of community, the third place, and the environment that we create around family.' ""The 63-year-old Schultz stepped down as Starbucks' CEO in early April, but remains the coffee chain's chairman. Schultz has proclaimed himself a ""life-long Democrat,"" and was an outspoken supporter of Hillary Clinton in her bid for the presidency.Still, in December, Schultz told CNBC that he didn't think think the Starbucks brand was ""at odds with the president-elect or his supporters."" He was also quick to criticize Trump's refugee policy earlier this year. Schultz, who was still CEO at the time, pledged in January to hire 10,000 refugees over the next five years after Trump's executive order suspended the U.S. refugee program and halted immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. The federal courts have temporarily blocked Trump from enforcing that order. This Starbucks policy sparked calls for a boycott when it was announced and it was the focus of criticism by some investors at the Starbucks' annual meeting in March.

95,Why Vladimir Putin's Russia likes seeing a damaged German-American alliance,Politics,30-05-2017,"VIDEO1:0001:00Why Vladimir Putin's Russia likes seeing a damaged German-American allianceNews VideosGermany's Angela Merkel has directly and publicly questioned the United States' commitment to Europe \xe2\x80\x94 and in all likelihood that very much pleases Russia's Vladimir Putin. At a series of diplomatic meetings last week, President Donald Trump disappointed European allies on issues related to defense, Russia and climate change. Merkel, typically a careful speaker seen as a key defender of a united Europe, then said at a campaign event Sunday that the ""times in which we could rely fully on others"" are ""somewhat over.""Trump has repeatedly expressed apparent animosity toward the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, institutions that have checked Russian influence in the region for decades. His decision not to explicitly endorse the NATO commitment to defend allies if they're attacked raised particular alarm among former diplomats, especially since his failure to do so comes just as Russia has become more militarily assertive.'Probably very pleased'Putin, Russia's president, sees opportunity in a weakened trans-Atlantic alliance. Russia \xe2\x80\x94 including the Soviet Union before it \xe2\x80\x94 has found itself set against a united West since at least 1949. The Americans, Western Europeans and Canadians militarily blocked the Soviet Union up to 1991, and have economically dwarfed it ever since. Moscow also has long resented European and American criticism of its human rights record.A divided West is easier to confront than a united one, and the United States and Germany are the two biggest economies in the Western alliance.Speaking to MSNBC on Tuesday, former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul said, ""I think the Russians are laughing"" in the wake of Trump's meetings last week with European leaders from NATO and the Group of Seven major industrial nations. VIDEO0:4500:45Trump fires back at Merkel, says Germany is 'very bad' for the USNews Videos""They're laughing at how easy it is and how our president, unfortunately, is helping with their agenda,"" McFaul said. ""Let's just be clear that NATO and G-7, those are our clubs ... that we set up to advance our national security interests, to advance our prosperity, and the result of this trip has been discord in both of those groups.""On Sunday, Trump tweeted that the trip to Europe was ""a great success for America."" Press secretary Sean Spicer added Tuesday that Trump and Merkel ""get along very well"" and said her call for Europe to take care of itself is what Trump wanted. ""More countries are stepping up their burden sharing. That's a good thing for them, that's a good thing for NATO, that's a good thing for America,"" Spicer said. But leaders like Merkel and newly elected French President Emmanuel Macron have shown that fracturing Europe could prove tough regardless of whether Trump is involved, according to Frances Burwell, a fellow at the Atlantic Council who focuses on EU-U.S. relations.""I do think that President Putin was probably very pleased to see the way the meetings went this past weekend. But it's far more important to note that his [anti-EU] candidate"" \xe2\x80\x94 Marine LePen, who is believed to have received assistance from the Kremlin \xe2\x80\x94 ""lost the French election,"" she said.""For the moment,"" Burwell said, ""I think what's going to matter is that Europeans stay together.""The Russian embassy press office in Washington directed CNBC to a tweeted statement from press secretary Dmitry Peskov, who said the U.S. and the EU should ""tackle their relations by themselves"" and that those ties are ""not our concern."" He said that Russia has ""always relied only on itself throughout centuries."" Trump, who won the White House with an anti-global message, has repeatedly bashed NATO and the European Union, which have formed the basis of U.S.-Europe cooperation for decades. While the White House says that the president is committed to alliances, he appeared to irk NATO members by publicly reprimanding them for not meeting their defense spending targets.Merkel has shifted recently by pushing for Continental self-reliance in the face of anti-EU movements within Europe, including the United Kingdom's vote to leave the union, Burwell said. Still, it is important to note that Merkel expressed her doubts about U.S. support at a campaign event in Germany, where anti-Trump rhetoric plays very well generally.Trump on Tuesday again attacked Germany for not meeting defense spending targets mandated by NATO and for its trade relationship with the U.S., contending \xe2\x80\x94 without any explanation \xe2\x80\x94 that ""this will change."" We have a MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany, plus they pay FAR LESS than they should on NATO & military. Very bad for U.S. This will changePutin is likely hoping that, if U.S. support wanes, ""Europe will begin to falter,"" Burwell said. But she added that ""Europe is becoming more united than we expected it to be,"" especially after Macron's win over far-right candidate Le Pen. Macron aimed to show that when he met Putin in France on Monday. The French president pressed his Russian counterpart on LGBT rights, Moscow's support for the Assad regime in Syria and alleged misinformation spread by Russia-funded media outlets in the French presidential campaign, according to The Associated Press.

""On a production job, I can make up to $3,500 a month after taxes,"" Strauss, 24, explains.Her income sounds cushy for a recent grad with less than $1,000 in student loan debt. But as a freelancer, her take-home pay can dip to $1,500 a month. She may have an acting or production gig for a time, followed by a waitress job, she says.""Honestly, I'm living month to month,"" says Strauss, whose bills include rent, food, cell phone, and car and health insurance. The rent is manageable at $850, but Strauss also spends $400 to $600 a month to buy organic groceries, and another $100 per month for personal upkeep, including salon appointments for her hair, nails and eyebrows. It sounds so L.A., but Strauss says, ""It's the cost of doing business as an actress.""Still, she's tried to cut back. ""I cancelled out my gym and yoga memberships, rarely eat out, and drink coffee at home instead of buying lattes,"" she says. For emergencies, like recently needing new tires for her 2008 Toyota Camry, Strauss' mom helps out.For now, saving and investing aren't happening.""I don't invest because I literally don't have any extra money,"" she says. ""But I've been listening to business guru Tony Robbins, so once I can afford to, I plan to invest.""Now in their 20s and early 30s, young Millennials like Strauss have yet to embrace investing in stocks to reach long-term goals, like funding retirement, surveys show. Nearly half of this generation \xe2\x80\x94 America's largest \xe2\x80\x94 say that investing is too risky, a BlackRock study reports. And just like Strauss, four of ten say they don't have enough spare income to put aside for the future, according to a just-released survey from Stash, a financial app.In the fall, she aims to start putting money in index funds, a type of mutual fund designed to match the components of a broad market index like the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.""I used to have the 'money is evil' mentality, but as I get older and read more about investing, I realize there's nothing wrong with wanting to be comfortable and not having to worry about your finances,"" Strauss says.The expert\xc2\xa0adviceRianka R. Dorsainvil, a certified financial planner and founder and president of Your Greatest Contribution, a financial planning firm in Washington, D.C., applauds Strauss for being a go-getter. She says savings must be a priority. Dorsainvil offers steps that Strauss and other young Millennials can take to jump-start their savings.Understand your cash flow. ""You have to assign every dollar a job, so start with a budget,"" Dorsainvil says. She recommends the You Need a Budget app. Users learn how to stop living check to check, get out of debt, and save more. It's free for 34 days, then costs $50 per year.Pay yourself first, period. Save 5% in an emergency fund and 10% in a retirement account, Dorsainvil says. ""For Kate, I would suggest a Roth IRA because she is in a very low income tax bracket, which means she will pay less on the contributions she makes today than she would 10 years from now when her salary increases,"" she says.Enlist an accountability partner. ""Find someone you strive to be like financially,"" she says. ""They are intentional about their spending, they are saving, and they are open to teaching you what they are doing."" Choose a person who wants to see you win.Avoid lifestyle creep. For instance, if Kate lands a new acting role, and her salary increases by $20,000, she may want a larger apartment. But, Dorsainvil warns, ""Instead of ditching your roommate and renting a more expensive apartment, stay where you are and continue to live off of your starting salary as long as possible,"" she says. Put your raise to better use by saving 50%, applying 30% toward paying off debt and spending 20% on what you want.Learn money basics.

Setyan downgraded B-Dubs shares to underperform from neutral and cut the price target to $115 from $150. Shares of the company recently changed hands at $144.63, down more than 4 percent.According to the analyst, if the company were to continue along its current strategy, same-store sales would likely grow at a slightly positive rate, but would be driven by discounting and promotions, which will ultimately drive the average check lower and place more pressure on Buffalo Wild Wings' margins. In addition, he pointed to growing wing costs and labor inflation as headwinds for Buffalo Wild Wings in coming quarters.All of this is a potential threat to the wing chain's ability to meet its earnings forecasts as the company is unlikely to be able to offset its higher costs by raising prices. As a result, Setyan reduced his 2017 earnings forecast to $5.16 a share from $5.48. His 2018 forecast dropped to $5.78 a share from $6.23 a share. Both estimates are far below the Wall Street consensus estimates. According to Thomson Reuters survey of analysts, B-Dubs is expected to earn $5.54 a share this year, and $6.79 a share next year. However, Setyan said the hedge fund's plan is not ""a viable alternative"" to the company's strategy.Marcato wants to boost Buffalo Wild Wings' franchised stores from 50 percent of its fleet to 90 percent, a strategy Setyan said is ""no longer compelling"" and likely won't boost the stock up significantly over current prices.""In recent presentations, Marcato has implied that the lower end of their expected 2-5 year range for the process of refranchising may be more realistic,"" he wrote. ""Even the lower end of that range is a meaningful amount of time for unit and area managers to deal with uncertainty in a highly competitive restaurant labor market.""Meanwhile, both sides continued to make their cases, just days ahead of the June 2 vote. Buffalo Wild Wings CEO Sally Smith addressed shareholders Tuesday, touting her nearly 21-year tenure with the company. She blamed slowing mall traffic, a decline in sports viewership, and millennial consumers who cook at home more frequently and order delivery for why sales have been sluggish.""Despite these headwinds, Buffalo Wild Wings continues to perform well, achieving positive same-store sales growth in the first quarter of 2017 and generating substantial free cash flow,"" she said.Smith also touted strategies the company is employing to improve its results such as testing smaller locations that can be opened in more heavily populated areas to focus on takeout and delivery. The chain also is trying marketing programs that are aimed at boosting check size and looking for ways to cut costs. On the other side, Marcato founder Mick McGuire boasted in a letter to shareholders Tuesday about the support it received from independent proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Egan-Jones.Egan-Jones supported all four of the board candidates proposed by Marcato, but ISS only supported three of the four. ISS backed McGuire, Scott Bergren, a former Pizza Hut CEO, and Sam Rovit, CEO of CTI Foods, who is also on Buffalo Wild Wings' slate. ISS did not support Lee Sanders, former chief development officer of TGI Fridays, saying that Sanders did not need to be added to the board because the proxy advisor did not feel Marcato needs to fully implement its refranchising strategy. Like Setyan, ISS said refranchising such a high percentage of restaurants could be risky as the transition period is very disruptive.In his research note, Setyan cited the experience that Jack in the Box had when it refranchised a smaller number of restaurants than is proposed for B-Dubs. Jack in the Box's employees felt insecure and were less productive during the conversion, according to the chain's CEO Lenny Comma. Marcato, which now owns 9.9 percent of the outstanding shares of Buffalo Wild Wings, continues to push for refranchising, which it believes will create significant value for shareholders. Both Buffalo Wild Wings and Marcato encouraged investors to vote for their proxy card ahead of the vote Friday.

100,Venezuela's political opposition finds a new weapon against its leftist dictator,Energy,30-05-2017,"VIDEO1:3401:34Goldman Sachs under scrutiny for Venezuela bond dealSquawk on the StreetVenezuela's opposition party is refining a new weapon against the government of embattled President Nicolas Maduro: threatening that the country's lenders may not get their money back after Maduro is removed from power.The leader of Venezuela's National Assembly, Julio Borges, criticized Goldman Sachs after the company bought the distressed debt of PDVSA, the country's state-owned oil company. Borges suggested that a future government might not honor the bonds.The letter accuses Goldman of ""making a quick buck off the suffering Venezuelan people"" by helping to prop up the Maduro regime. Venezuela's government has mismanaged the country's economy, leading to severe food shortages and staggering inflation, but despite those hardships it has continued to make debt payments.This is by no means going to dramatically change the political, economic or social dynamics on the ground.Risa Grais-TargowEurasia Group Latin America directorThe repayment threats are the only leverage the opposition has right now, beyond supporting the huge street protests that have rocked the country, said Risa Grais-Targow, director of risk consultancy Eurasia Group's Latin America practice.The opposition is trying to hasten Maduro's end by starving the government of financing and making his rule untenable.The Development Bank of Latin America reportedly held off disbursing $440 million in loans earlier this year due to maneuvering by Venezuela's opposition-held National Assembly. Politicians refused to approve debt financing and then warned that future governments would not be obligated to pay back the money if Maduro secured the funds without assembly approval.This shows the strategy is working, said Grais-Targow.An opposition activist clashes with the police as they block the Francisco Fajardo highway in Caracas during a demonstration against President Nicolas Maduro's government on May 29, 2017.Juan Barreto | AFP | Getty Images Goldman Sachs bought $865 million worth of the PDVSA bonds at 31 cents on the dollar, CNBC confirmed.The bank purchased the bonds ""on the secondary market from a broker and did not interact with the Venezuelan government,"" it said in a statement, adding, ""We recognize that \xe2\x80\xa6 Venezuela is in crisis. We agree that life there has to get better, and we made the investment in part because we believe it will.""It is not uncommon for an asset management arm to buy distressed corporate debt in that way, but the bonds were being held by the Venezuelan central bank at the time of purchase. Goldman Sachs had not been aware of that, the bank said, but that likely played into the reaction by Venezuela's opposition.Either way, the purchase is small relative to Goldman Sachs Asset Management's total managed assets of $1.3 trillion, $40 billion of which is in emerging markets. The asset management unit itself accounts for 19 percent of Goldman Sachs revenue.VIDEO1:1301:13Venezuela protests turn deadlyDigital OriginalDany Bahar, fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the bonds purchased by Goldman are ""vastly undervalued.""""This is a sign of desperation from the Venezuelan government,"" he told CNBC, adding that a default is inevitable if the current administration remains in power.Venezuela faces a ""brutal debt service schedule,"" with $3.5 billion in payments coming due in October and November, noted Eurasia Group's Grais-Targow.Staying on top of Venezuela's debt will almost certainly be the ruling party's priority, she said, though the influx of hard currency into the central bank could also fund imports and ease pressure on the state oil company, which has struggled to maintain production.However, Goldman's bond purchase could at best help around the margins at PDVSA, said Grais-Targow. Nor is it sufficient to quell street protests.""This is by no means going to dramatically change the political, economic or social dynamics on the ground,"" she said.\xe2\x80\x94 CNBC's Fred Imbert contributed reporting to this story.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/30/venezuelan-opposition-threatens-not-to-repay-bonds.html

Speaking at the New York Association for Business Economics luncheon on Tuesday, Brainard also said recent inflation numbers are lower than expected and there is little sign of wage inflation heating up.The Fed did not raise the bank's key interest rate in May, after raising rates in December and March. An interest rate hike is widely expected in June,  a move that would push the target range up to 1 percent to 1.25 percent.Brainard, a member of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee, said President Donald Trump's tax cuts could equal 2 percent of GDP in the first few years, and the cuts would boost demand at full employment. The Trump administration said its pro-business agenda would hit 3 percent GDP.Brainard's comment came after Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan told CNBC earlier Tuesday he does not think the economy is about to take off. He sees growth of about 2 percent.""Two things drive GDP: growth in the labor force and growth in productivity,"" he said on ""Squawk Box."" ""The problem is labor force growth is very sluggish. And my own judgment and our economists at the Dallas Fed think it's going to continue to be sluggish the next 10 years because the population is aging and labor force growth therefore is slowing.""The FOMC's next meeting is June 13-14.\xe2\x80\x94CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/30/brainard-rate-hike-likely-appropriate-soon-but-slowing-inflation-could-prompt-rethink-on-hikes.html
105,North Carolina's largest health insurer puts a price tag on ongoing uncertainty,Health and Science,30-05-2017,"VIDEO5:0005:00Blue Cross NC files for 22.9% rate increase for ACA in 2018Closing BellNorth Carolina's largest health insurer is warning its Obamacare members that it may have to hike rates more than 20 percent for the second year in a row, and the reason has everything to do with mixed messages from Washington over subsidy funding.""This is an urgent situation, and we simply need to know what the rules of the game are going to be for 2018 in order to hit affordability as well as stability,"" said Brad Wilson, CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina.While Republicans have pointed to health insurer exits from Affordable Care Act exchanges as signs that Obamacare is in an irrevocable death spiral, executives at Blue Cross Blue Shield North Carolina say that's not the whole story.Blue Cross detailed what went into its rate requests in a blog, telling its members that the key driver of their 2018 rate request has to do with uncertainty over cost-sharing reduction subsidies for low-income enrollees, which are built into the ACA. Source: Blue Cross Blue Shield North Carolina Wilson said his company wrote the blog because customers need to understand the situation. ""We felt it was important as we go into the rate approval process for 2018 that our customers understand the importance of the CRS funding, hence disclosure of the information,"" he said. More than two-thirds of its 500,000 Obamacare customers rely on CSRs to help with out-of-pocket costs. Insurers on the exchange make the payments up front \xe2\x80\x94 an estimated $7 billion this year \xe2\x80\x94 and up until now the federal government has reimbursed them. If CSRs are funded next year, Blue Cross NC said it will only need to raise rates by 8.8 percent: 5.8 percent for rising medical costs, and 3 percent for the health insurance industry tax.But if the Trump administration pulls the plug, the insurer said, it will need to increase rates by an additional 14.1 percent, for a total of 22.9 percent rate hikes.""We feel it's important that we work very hard to try to continue the stability that we're actually seeing in the North Carolina marketplace,"" Wilson said. ""What we're doing is we're saying the same thing to our elected officials in Washington that we're saying to our customers,"" he continued. ""We're explaining what makes up a rate. Yes, it's the CSR money. It's also the ever-increasing volume and pricing of our medical underlying health-care expense. And also part of this rate is a reflection of the health-insurer tax, which will come back in 2018.""A federal judge ruled in favor of House Republicans, who sued the Obama administration over funding for CSRs, ruling that they had to be authorized by Congress. The administration appealed the decision. But now it's up to the Trump administration to decide whether it wants to continue that appeal. Earlier this month, the Trump administration asked the court to keep the case on hold until next September, but the president has not made clear whether his administration plans to continue paying for CSRs in 2018.Nationally, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that defunding CSR payments would cause insurers to raise premiums on mid-tier Obamacare plans by as much as 23 percent next year.According to Kaiser, cutting CSRs would actually increase federal Obamacare costs by more than $2 billion, because higher premiums would result in bigger tax credits for both low- and middle-income enrollees.Health insurers must submit rate requests by June 21 for 2018 plans. So far, Aetna, Humana and a handful of others have pulled back from the exchanges, citing the uncertainty. Those insurers who do submit rate requests do not have to commit to staying on the Obamacare exchanges until late September.Wilson said there are a number of factors that will influence Blue Cross NC's decision, but ""a fair and competitive rate is critical to that.""""For all practical purposes, we are certainly the largest and effectively the only ACA alternative for most North Carolinians,"" Wilson said. Wilson also urged Congress to focus on affordability and stability in any health-reform legislation that they consider, and to act quickly. While the House passed an Obamacare repeal bill known as the American Health Care Act by a narrow one-vote margin, the Senate may consider crafting its own legislation.\xe2\x80\x94CNBC's Michelle Fox contributed to this report.

We can't make a judgment, and who knows what will happen if the bears are wrong and the president actually gets his way on some tax reform, any tax reform,"" Cramer said.

Consumer spending was previously reported to have been unchanged in March.When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.2 percent last month after advancing 0.5 percent in March.Consumer spending grew at its slowest pace in more than seven years in the first quarter. That helped to restrict gross domestic product growth to a 1.2 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year. GDP growth estimates for the second quarter range between a rate of 2 percent and 3 percent.Minutes of the Fed's May 2-3 policy meeting, which were published last week, showed that while policymakers agreed they should hold off hiking rates until there was evidence the growth slowdown was transitory, ""most participants"" believed ""it would soon be appropriate"" to raise borrowing costs.The U.S. central bank hiked rates by 25 basis points in March. Expectations of further policy tightening next month are also supported by steadily rising inflation.The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rebounded 0.2 percent in April, reversing March's 0.2 percent drop. In the 12 months through April, the PCE price index increased 1.7 percent after rising 1.9 percent in March.Excluding food and energy, the so-called core PCE price index also bounced back 0.2 percent after dipping 0.1 percent in March. In the 12 months through April, the core PCE price indexincreased 1.5 percent after rising 1.6 percent in March.The core PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation measure. The central bank has a 2 percent target.Personal income rose 0.4 percent last month after gaining 0.2 percent in March.

Euro zone finance ministers' failure to agree on Greek debt relief with the International Monetary Fund last week also added to risk aversion.""The ongoing political uncertainty in the market is really driving safe-haven buying at the moment,"" said ANZ analyst Daniel Hynes. ""Weaker equity markets certainly have played their part, but support from that has been sporadic and we're continuously seeing a strong level of safe-haven demand being the primary driver still.""Political uncertainty in Europe also weighed on world stocks and kept the euro under pressure.

Of note: Amazon is more than four times more valuable than those 14 other companies combined.Amazon has split three times since its IPO in 1997. In 1998, it issued a 2-for-1 split. In January 1999, it issued a 3-for-1 split and in September 1999, it split 2-for-1. When Amazon hit $1,000, it's technically the equivalent of a $12,000 share price in today's terms.Amazon topped estimates in late April when it posted revenue of $35.7 billion and an earnings per share of $1.48, sending the stock on its upward trend. Amazon said sales increased 23 percent during the quarter and its Amazon Web Services business sales increased 42 percent, showing increased demand for its cloud services business.Alphabet isn't too far behind; shares of its Class A stock are trading above $995.-- CNBC's Peter Shacknow contributed to this reportWATCH:\xc2\xa0An inside look at how Amazon Prime Now delivers food and household items in less than two hoursVIDEO1:5701:57Inside Amazon's Prime Now hub in SeattleDigital Original",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/30/amazon-shares-hit-1000.html
112,Fed's Kaplan says he sees two more rate hikes for 2017,Federal Reserve,30-05-2017,"VIDEO2:4802:48Fed's Kaplan: I see two more rate hikes in 2017Squawk BoxDallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, in an interview Tuesday with CNBC, set out a course for a fairly aggressive path of rate hikes coupled with reductions in the central bank's balance sheet for the remainder of the year.However, he doesn't think that's because the economy is about to take off.Instead, Kaplan sees growth likely continuing on the path of about 2 percent and not the 3 percent or more boom in gross domestic product that President Donald Trump and his economic advisors have been forecasting.""Two things drive GDP: growth in the labor force and growth in productivity,"" he said in a live interview on ""Squawk Box."" ""The problem is labor force growth is very sluggish. And my own judgment and our economists at the Dallas Fed think it's going to continue to be sluggish the next 10 years because the population is aging and labor force growth therefore is slowing.""Still, Kaplan said he foresees two more interest rate increases in 2017  and a start to the process of unwinding the Fed's $4.5 trillion bond portfolio, most of which was accumulated after the financial crisis.""I think that removal of accommodation should be done gradually and patiently,"" he added.Kaplan is president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and a voting member of the Fed's policy-setting committee.The Fed is widely expected to hike its benchmark interest rate in June, a move that would push the target range up to 1 percent to 1.25 percent. The market has not priced in another hike this year, though, with an additional move in December currently being given just a 49 percent chance, according to the CME.In addition, central bank officials at their meeting earlier this month agreed on a process to start letting a to-be-determined amount of the bonds on the balance sheet to roll off each month.The balance sheet ballooned during three rounds of bond buying the central bank conducted in an effort to boost the economy after the Great Recession. While stock market values soared during the quantitative easing effort, broader economic growth has been mired around the 2 percent range.Kaplan said the balance sheet should be ""substantially less"" than it is today but conceded that it likely will remain above $2 trillion. ""I don't want to put a specific number on it. If somebody says in the 2s, that sounds about right to me,"" he said.On the economy, Kaplan was less enthusiastic about the prospects for significantly stronger growth.Trump has laid out a pro-growth agenda of tax cuts, reduced business regulations and stronger infrastructure spending that he believes can lift the economy out of its post-financial crisis malaise.While Kaplan said some of those ideas would be positive for the economy, he warned that restrictions on immigration could be a negative, as would tax cuts that are financed by increasing the government's budget deficit.""If it's tax reform, I think that could be helpful. If it's a tax cut financed by increasing the deficit, my concern is that may give a short-term bump to GDP growth, but not a sustainable bump to GDP,"" he said. ""And over the horizon we'll have similar growth that we have now, except we'll have more leverage, we'll have higher debt to GDP and I think that will be negative for economic growth.""Get the market reaction here.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/30/feds-kaplan-says-he-sees-two-more-rate-hikes-for-2017.html
113,Germany\xe2\x80\x99s Merck KGaA chooses Israeli deception technology,Investing in: Israel,30-05-2017,"iStock | Getty Images PlusDark web intelligence, bio-authorization and even plain old cloud security: Cybersecurity commands a futuristic and slightly dystopian-sounding lexicon. One term that may well become more familiar is deception technology. It's a small but growing field that has sparked the interest of some of the largest multinational companies.Israeli startup illusive networks, which is the way they spell it - no capital letters for a deception technology firm, and Germany-based pharmaceutical and life sciences company Merck KGaA, Tuesday announced a deal for the use of illusive's ""Deception Everywhere"" cybersecurity technology.  Merck, a company with over $15 billion in net sales last year, has an extensive network to protect that stretches across six continents and has intellectual property worth millions. A 2015 Ponemon Institute study found that together with the financial services industry, pharmaceutical companies suffer the highest cost from data breaches.Companies such as illusive don't come into play at the first, most basic level of defenses against cyber threats, explains Merck's Branden Newman, head of business technology security.VIDEO2:0302:03Why the need for cybersecurity is risingStreet Signs Asia""The idea is that if an advanced attacker makes it past these standardized controls, there is a next level of protection that really protects our crown jewels,"" says Newman, who used to work for the U.S. Army Cyber Command. This level is where illusive fits in, as well as on the level of the continuous monitoring the system undergoes.Illusive networks is the first company to come out of Israel's team8, the cybersecurity startup incubator set up by of veterans of the Israeli military's Unit 8200, says illusive's founder and CEO Ofer Israeli. He explains that the deception technology developed by illusive is really attractive to high-risk clients, like those in the financial services and pharmaceutical industries""The types of attacks that we are catching and that we have been built to mitigate are really those low probability high-impact attacks. The ones that won't hit you every day but when they do hit you it can go to tens and hundreds of millions of dollars,"" says Israeli.The value of the deal has not been disclosed but Merck's Newman says that the extra layer of protection afforded by illusive does not come at a huge price. ""Monetarily it's a relatively a low investment compared to the overall the security portfolio.""That's partly because deception technology is not yet as widespread as more standardized cybersecurity solutions. Gartner research estimates that by next year one in ten companies will deploy deception technology and various reports estimate the market for it by 2021 to be between $1.33 billion and $1.7 billion.There are several reasons why Merck went for illusive over two or three other candidates, says Newman. Among those are the Israeli technology's ""proactive approach"" and ""ease of deployment"" that obviates the need for a mass install across Merck's systems.He likens the technology to a corridor with lots of doors. If attackers enter the corridor, they don't know which door to go through and if they even lightly jar one, the system is alerted.Merck keeps a close tab on Israeli cybersecurity startups, says Newman. ""We have a very close connection to the U.S. startup scene but we also do keep an eye on the Israeli startup scene, particularly in the cybersecurity area because they have a very strong cybersecurity startup scene.""In the meantime, illusive has spread its wings beyond Israel, especially in terms of sales and marketing, says Ofer Israeli. ""From an R&D perspective, Israel is a perfect fit. For sales and marketing there's a much clearer fit in other portions of the world such as the United States,"" says Israeli.The company has gathered more than $30 million from early investors, including Microsoft Ventures, Cisco, Citi Ventures and NEA.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

116,US senator calls for probe into promotion of Kushner Cos deal,Politics,30-05-2017,"Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.Getty ImagesThe chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee has called for an investigation into ""potentially fraudulent statements and misrepresentations"" made by companies promoting investment in a property development involving the family company of White House advisor Jared Kushner.Citing a May 12 report by Reuters, Chuck Grassley, a Republican senator from Iowa, requested a review of claims made by Chinese migration agency Qiaowai and the U.S. Immigration Fund (USIF) in the marketing of the One Journal Square project in Jersey City, New Jersey to potential investors in China.Grassley flagged his concerns to the Department of Homeland Security and the Securities and Exchange Commission in a May 24 letter that was later posted on his website.Jupiter, Florida-based USIF contracted with Beijing-based Qiaowai to market projects including One Journal Square to potential investors through the controversial EB-5 scheme. The program offers qualified foreign investors the chance at a green card in exchange for a $500,000 investment in a U.S. business.Kushner Companies is also working with KABR Group, a private equity fund, on the One Journal Square project, according to marketing materials on Qiaowai's website. The developers are seeking to raise $150 million, or 15.4 percent of the funding, from EB-5 investors.Because the SEC considers some EB-5 investments securities, companies, and individuals that market these investments must comply with U.S. securities laws.EB-5 schemes must also comply with immigration rules. Under United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) guidelines, EB-5 investors must put their capital at risk and the green card is not guaranteed. USCIS is part of the Department of Homeland Security.In an emailed response to a request for comment on Grassley's letter, Stu Loeser, a spokesman for USIF, said: ""Qiaowai and U.S. Immigration Fund are fully in compliance with all laws relating to the sale of securities to immigrant investors. These allegations are gross distortions and unsupported by the facts.""White House senior advisor Jared Kushner (C) sits alongside U.S. President Donald Trump (L) and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross (2nd L) as they prepare to meet with Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and the Saudi delegation at the Royal Court in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia May 20, 2017.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersReuters previously revealed that Qiaowais promotional materials online and on social media, including for the One Journal Square project, sometimes referred to a green card guarantee or safeguard and the safety of capital invested in EB-5 projects.After Reuters contacted Qiaowai for comment, these phrases were deleted. Qiaowai has also dropped the phrase ""government-supported"" from its online promotion of the One Journal Square project.It is a fundamental rule of the EB-5 program that an applicants investment must remain at risk up to the end of the aliens conditional permanent resident status, and a guaranteed investment fails this basic EB-5 test; if Qiaowai is in fact guaranteeing the safety of the investment principal, all related EB-5 petitions should be rejected by USCIS, wrote Grassley, who has long advocated for reform of the EB-5 program.Qiaowais assurances to investors that their green cards were guaranteed and their funds were safe appeared to violate U.S. securities laws, Grassley's letter said. It also cited a report on the project's promotion by The New York Times.Kushner Companies and the SEC declined to comment. Qiaowai, KABR Group and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment over the weekend.Chinese investors account for around 80 percent of the nearly 10,000 EB-5 visas issued annually.Criticism of the program has centered on instances of fraud and the fact that most of the funds in a program originally intended to help impoverished areas have instead gone to wealthy urban districts. Despite these concerns, earlier this month, Congress extended the EB-5 program until September 30.The Chinese road show for One Journal Square earlier this month also attracted criticism. Kushner Companies apologized for Nicole Kushner Meyers reference to her brother, President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, during the road show.The company stressed that he was only mentioned in order to make clear that he was not involved with the project. Kushner Companies representatives skipped some later road show events.Jared Kushner, whose White House portfolio includes relations with China, sold his stake in Kushner Companies to a family trust early this year.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/30/us-senator-calls-for-probe-into-promotion-of-kushner-cos-deal.html

Given that it's currently at 97, there's no question that these support levels are indeed holding,"" Cramer said. ""As much as we might want a weaker dollar, the charts seem to suggest that it is not in the cards.""Beyond that, Boroden thinks the dollar could even be due for a bottom based on the length of its past moves.The currency's latest downtrend lasted for 20 weeks since the peak, she noted \xe2\x80\x94 very similar to its past four declines, which ranged from 21 weeks to 24.""It may sound really glib to say, 'Hey the dollar index just dropped for 22 weeks last time around, so now that we're 20 weeks into this decline it's probably ready for a rebound.' But that analysis would've actually worked the last four times!"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.To further cement her point, Boroden used her signature method, running Fibonacci ratios, to determine if the dollar index's decline is really ready to turn into a rally.The ""Fibonacci Queen"" spotted a number of cycles that come to pass around the first week of June, yet another sign that the dollar's pullback could be ending soon.""In fact, she says it's entirely possible that the dollar index already bottomed last week,"" Cramer said. ""So if this long-term uptrend in the greenback remains intact, she wouldn't be surprised if the dollar index ... can go from 97, where it is now, to 105, which would be a pretty substantial move for a currency even if it doesn't sound like very much.""Overall, Boroden's analysis suggests that the next few weeks could bring back the dollar's tailwinds, in turn putting pressure on companies with international operations, because a strong dollar means overseas earnings are converted into fewer dollars for U.S.-based players.""As much as I like to focus on the fundamentals of individual companies, the truth is that big-picture issues like currency do matter to the stock market,"" Cramer said. ""If you thought the terrible, horrible, super-freaking-strong dollar had finally gone away, the charts, as interpreted by Carolyn Boroden, say 'Not so fast.' She thinks the dollar's decline is running out of gas, and it will soon resume its long march higher. Perhaps it bottomed already.""Watch the full segment here:VIDEO6:3406:34Cramer's charts reveal why the US dollar might be due for another upswingMad Money with Jim CramerQuestions for Cramer?

""Remember, Amazon is the ultimate non-Trump stock.""In fact, what attracts investors to stocks like Amazon's is they seem like they will grow regardless of whether President Donald Trump's economic agenda is fulfilled or not.Cramer argued that lower corporate taxes would not move the needle much for Amazon, since the company does not need to make more money right away to continue its global expansion.Bringing back cash from overseas, otherwise known as repatriation, would likely not interest the e-commerce giant either because of its focus on growing international operations.And deregulation does not affect the not-very-regulated Amazon, though Trump's hardliner stance on some of the United States' trading partners, like Germany, could bring tariffs on some goods, which could cause the company to lose money.""In short, Amazon is a stock that performs better than a lot of others when it seems like Trump is incapable of getting anything done, and we just need to adjust to the status quo of slow growth with two interest rate hikes from the Fed, including one possibly coming next month,"" Cramer said.Jeff Bezos speaking at the new New York Economic Club luncheon with Charlie Rose in New York on Oct. 27, 2016.Adam Jeffery | CNBC While Amazon is perhaps an over-appreciated tech stock, Cramer also takes pleasure in finding under-appreciated names like Autodesk, a computer software company serving an array of industries from engineering to entertainment.The stock of Autodesk has run up about 95 percent over the last twelve months, a rally that made the ""Mad Money"" host want to take a closer look after pounding the table on the stock in February.""Would I take more profits? Well, Autodesk is hitting its targets. The subscription business continues to grow rapidly. [The] piracy crackdown is working. Basically, it's on track to be a pretty compelling growth story,"" Cramer said.But the stock is very expensive, trading at 12 times sales \xe2\x80\x94 ""nosebleed territory,"" by Cramer's account \xe2\x80\x94 so much so that any hit to the $113 stock price could send it tumbling.""I am still a huge fan of the stock of Autodesk and the company, but if you bought the stock after I recommended it in February, I'm blessing taking some off the table,"" Cramer said. ""Given the long-term growth targets, I'd hold onto the rest. And for those who don't own any? When we get the inevitable Nasdaq pullback, keep this one on your shopping list. Why? Because Autodesk a winner.""Stripes of one dollar notes travel through a large examining packaging equipment machine after receiving a $100 currency strap at the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington.Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFirms that do business overseas have been breathing sighs of relief as the U.S. dollar trends lower, but Cramer's charts suggest that the decline may not last.To find out more about the currency's movements, the ""Mad Money"" host turned to the charts of Carolyn Boroden, the technician behind FibonacciQueen.com and Cramer's colleague at RealMoney.com.First, Cramer examined the weekly chart of the U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the greenback's value against other foreign currencies.Boroden noticed that the dollar index has been hitting higher highs and higher lows for some time, a sign that the dollar could be gearing up for a rally if it holds those lows.""Perhaps more important, Boroden sees three major floors of support for the dollar index, all of which run from 95 to 96 and change. Given that it's currently at 97, there's no question that these support levels are indeed holding,"" Cramer said. ""As much as we might want a weaker dollar, the charts seem to suggest that it is not in the cards.""MiguelMalo | Getty ImagesWith stocks pulling back modestly as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq slip from their 7-day rallies, Cramer said one index will prove whether the rally still has legs: the Dow Jones Transportation Average.The ""Mad Money"" host noticed that the group has been trading lower since its March 1 peak, which he attributed to the narrowing of the overall market rally as investors move to faster growing stocks.Looking closely at the stocks that make up the transports index, Cramer found a few key trends.""The first thing you notice with the transports is how few stocks are really doing the heavy lifting of the plus-13 percent, and two of the best performers are related to each other: the railroads CSX, up 50 percent, and Norfolk Southern, up [15 percent],"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.Other leaders in the group, however, were sparse.Philip Morris International: Smoking in a Smokeless World?In light of the World Health Organization's World No Tobacco Day, Cramer addressed one ""sin"" stock, cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris International, to track its unexpected gains.Although the world is largely moving away from smoking cigarettes, Cramer said that Philip Morris has been very well managed, with its stock rallying over 30 percent year-to-date.As the tobacco industry consolidates and innovates to hold on to a retreating audience, Philip Morris has developed its own smoke-free tobacco platform, iQOS, a growth product that has gained popularity overseas.The ""Mad Money"" host said that he might like to see Philip Morris and Altria merge, undoing their breakup from a decade ago. He said the move could be helped by deregulation from the Trump administration.""That may not be so great from a public health perspective, OK? but this is 'Mad Money' here. It means the United States will likely become a much less toxic place for the tobacco companies to do business, so it's easy to see why Philip Morris might want to gobble up Altria in order to get some gigantic U.S. exposure,"" Cramer explained.And the company pays shareholders a healthy dividend of roughly 3.5 percent, an attractive benefit compared to bond yields, which have been slammed in the past several months.""Here's the bottom line on this very tricky, hard-to-understand story: Philip Morris International is on the upswing, and it's on the upswing for good reason \xe2\x80\x94 the company's smokeless tobacco technology is taking the world by storm, it's got incredible momentum, and the business is on track to grow its earnings nicely even as the core cigarette business continues to shrink,"" Cramer said. ""The stock's had a big run, but I think it's worth buying, particularly into any weakness the next time we get a nice worldwide pullback.""Lightning Round: In Retail, it's a Dog-Eat-Dog WorldIn Cramer's lightning round, he rattled off his take on caller favorite stocks, including:Camping World Holdings: ""I've got to tell you, I think it's well run, but boy, there is a lot of competition in that space, which is why the stock has been under pressure. I can't recommend a stock when there's that much competition. It's just a dog-eat-dog world in that segment right now.""Dycom Industries: ""I don't know, man. That was not just a regular [earnings] miss. I would hold off on that one. That was a nasty miss. They've got to do a better quarter before I would commit to that.""Questions for Cramer?

""Kids petted it, people were taking pictures with it. A few were upset and kicked it.""Gardega said he created his clay and faux bronze ""Sketchy Dog"" as an act of solidarity with guerilla artist Arturo Di Modica, who created Wall Street's iconic ""Charging Bull"" statue.""I have a lot of empathy for the creator of the bull, Arturo. He is very upset,"" Gardega said.Di Modica finished ""Charging Bull"" after the 1987 stock market collapse, and placed it in front of the New York Stock Exchange as a symbol of American resilience. The city initially removed it, but later re-installed it in its current location near Wall Street in the Financial District.Conversely, the ""Fearless Girl"" statue, was  commissioned by one of the world's largest banks \xe2\x80\x94 State Street Global Advisors \xe2\x80\x94 as a way to call attention to the gender pay gap and a lack of women on corporate financial sector boards, according to the company.State Street is also the creator of  the Gender Diversity Index SHE, which tracks gender diversity in companies. An inscription at the feet of ""Fearless Girl"" reads, ""Know the Power of Leadership, SHE makes a difference.""""That piece, ['Fearless Girl'] was not made by some individual artist making a statement,"" Gardega said. ""It was made by a billion dollar financial firm trying to promote an index fund. It is advertising/promotion in the guise of art. That was my only point.""But Gardega said there is some value in the ""Fearless Girl"" sculpture. He said it's clear that it makes children happy, and ""art is supposed to make kids happy.""After approximately three hours, Gardega took his ""Sketchy Dog"" down.""I didn't want to leave it to be taken and certainly had no rights [sic] to bolt it to the ground,"" he said.Gardega also said that there's nothing inherently wrong with the ""Fearless Girl,"" and he created ""Sketchy Dog"" with a sense of humor, but he said neither piece should interfere with Di Modica's work.""I'm a pretty happy person, not seething or angry and certainly not anti-feminist. My piece is not without a sense of humor but I do feel for Arturo and the integrity of his art,"" Gardega said. ""There is plenty of room for 'Fearless Girl.'

127,Here's why the 'immaculate rotation' across sectors is driving the market,Investing,30-05-2017,"Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe pat and popular stock-market story this spring goes like this: A small group of lavishly capitalized tech stocks, anointed by the pundits and adored by the momentum crowd, have dragged an otherwise sluggish tape to a grudging record high.  This is both inaccurate and less interesting than the reality.  For sure, Big Tech has been the clear leader, returning 20 percent so far this year. But between March 1, when the  first touched 2,400, and last week, when it closed slightly above that level three days straight, the market has been held aloft by a fairly broad but constantly shifting collection of stocks and sectors.  The running tally of rising stocks versus decliners, known as the cumulative advance-decline line, is at an all-time high along with the S&P 500. The equal-weighted version of the index, gauged by the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP), is just half a percent below its record peak.  Goldman Sachs maintains a market-breadth index to track the inclusiveness of the market trend. It's now at 25, on a hypothetical scale from zero to 100. The 30-year average is 35, so the market has been somewhat less broad than usual. But in 2015, the year of the mania over high-tech FANG stocks, the index sank to 5, signaling acute narrowness.  Meantime, today, five of the 10 traditional S&P sectors have outperformed the index itself year to date. And, crucially, U.S. stocks have won affirmation from foreign markets, with the MSCI All-Country World Index also stretching to a new high recently.  So, finding winning stocks is not quite like shooting fish in a barrel, but dropping a line in will usually draw enough bites to keep it interesting.  The odd wrinkle right now is the way, on a given day, it's as if sectors take turns holding up the market. The unusual combination of high-momentum tech and boring, defensive sectors have shared leadership. Bespoke Investment Group notes the uncommon setup right now: The market is in record territory, yet the most ""overbought"" groups are consumer staples and utilities.  On days when Treasury yields rise a bit and those ""bond-proxy"" sectors take a breather, the lagging bank and transportation stocks will bounce and keep the market from losing much ground, if any. Think of a basketball team whose bench players keep the game close while the stars sit out to rest.  One traditional technical sign of a powerful daily move is 90 percent or more of stocks surging or selling off in near-unison. There hasn't been a ""90 percent day"" since Oct. 11, and the last one on an up day was July 8.  Larry McMillan of the investment-advisory service The Option Strategist says: ""It is unusual to go this long without a 90 percent day of either kind, but it is an accurate reflection of the type of market that has existed since the election: No matter which way the market goes, there always seem to be a decent number of stocks going the other way.""  So what's the larger message of this ""immaculate rotation"" that's been animating the market?  For one thing, it suggests little urgency for investors to exit stocks even when the occasional data release is poor or the Treasury yield curve flattens a bit more. Money seems to slide around to another part of the market, even as new inflows to stock funds have been tepid and uneven.  This might indicate a broad agreement right now on the global macro outlook. Not blind group-think, but a preponderance of evidence that worldwide growth has firmed, credit markets remain sturdy and most of the risks or stress points are not yet imminent threats (whether an inflation overshoot, dip into deflation, central-bank tightening or a financial accident in China).  The push-pull of equity rotation is also a key factor in keeping volatility at such a numbingly low idle in recent months. When there is a lot of offsetting action among stocks and sectors, index-level volatility is stifled. This never lasts forever, and the odds say the tape will become more jumpy \xe2\x80\x94 and almost can't get more calm. But this isn't a very helpful observation for timing or sizing the next significant move.  The almost coordinated-seeming oscillation among sectors has also, for better and worse, kept the market from undergoing a nice cleansing washout for months. The little 3 percent dip in March was mild and fleeting, and never really flushed the market to create a nice oversold condition that could reset investor sentiment and set up a slingshot move higher for a high-energy run higher.  That's well and good, and breakouts to new highs are always to be respected, even if they come in the recent grinding fashion.  Urban Carmel of the Fat Pitch blog points out that the recent extreme calm and a variety of other factors argue against the idea that a significant market top is near. For one thing, bull markets tend to falter and weaken in more visible ways before peaking, he says.  Yet, if the S&P 500 goes another 3\xc2\xbd weeks without sliding by 5 percent, it will become the longest streak without such a setback since 2009, and one of the dozen longest periods without a 5 percent drop since the 1930s.  This is both a sign of strength, and a suggestion that the odds continue to get longer for stocks to remain this unflappable. This is an expensive market that has been impressive in refusing plenty of excuses to get spooked. We've used up the likely best quarter of earnings growth this year: June brings a tougher seasonal record, bank stocks are struggling and hints of complacency are growing.  The key is not to start betting on an immediate market failure, but to recognize the market is selective in its rewards and expect a stiffer downside test relatively soon. Chances are, it won't be The Big One.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/30/heres-why-the-immaculate-rotation-across-sectors-is-driving-the-market.html
128,Conagra makes takeover approach to Pinnacle Foods: Sources,Deals and IPOs,31-05-2017,"Reddi-wip whipped cream owner Conagra Brands has approached Pinnacle Foods, the maker of packaged foods such as Vlasic pickles, to express interest in an acquisition, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.Conagra's approach shows that Pinnacle Foods remains an acquisition target, three years after its $4.3 billion sale to Hillshire Brands was canceled after Hillshire agreed to sell itself to Tyson Foods Inc for $7.7 billion.A can of ConAgra Foods Inc. Hunts brand organic diced tomatoes is arranged for a photograph.Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesHillshire was led at the time by Sean Connolly, who is now chief executive of Conagra. His second attempt at an acquisition of Pinnacle Foods underscores the need for further consolidation in the frozen food and condiments sectors, as sales continue to decline with consumers opting for healthier choices.Conagra's approach to Pinnacle Foods took place in the last few weeks, the sources said. There is no certainty that Pinnacle Foods will choose to engage, or that Conagra will pursue a potential deal further, the sources said on Wednesday.The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Conagra, which has a market value of $16.2 billion, declined to comment. Pinnacle Foods, which has a market value of $7.2 billion, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Chicago, Illinois-based Conagra, whose brands include Frontera salsa and Orville Redenbacher's popcorn, has been seeking to reinvent itself since selling its private label unit for $2.7 billion in 2016 to focus on its branded food business.Last year it spun off its $6.9 billion frozen potato business, Lamb Weston Holdings Inc. It has also divested a number of its smaller underperforming brands, and this week agreed to sell its Wesson oil brand to Folgers coffee maker J.M. Smucker for $285 million.Parsippany, New Jersey-based Pinnacle, whose brands include Duncan Hines baking products and Birds Eye frozen vegetables, has made a push towards healthier offerings. It bought Boulder Brands, owner of Udi's Gluten Free Bread, for $975 million last year.Conagra and Pinnacle Foods are among the companies weighing offers for Reckitt Benckiser Group's North American food business, estimated to be worth around $3 billion, Reuters reported earlier on Wednesday.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/conagra-makes-takeover-approach-to-pinnacle-foods-sources.html

""So I'm not sure that the correlation is necessarily in sync at this point in time.""Previously when the dollar fell, crude would rise as each barrel would be worth more in dollar terms. But the absence of higher prices for crude despite a falling dollar leaves Yamada believing that the commodity will likely be stuck in a range, even if it doesn't tumble substantially.According to Yamada, this range is likely to be $45 to $55, meaning that ""[there isn't] a compelling directional indication at this point"" that would suggest a big move for crude.Crude continued its losing streak on Wednesday, falling by more than 3 percent on news that Libya was raising production at a time when oil oversupply is still a concern for OPEC.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/a-break-in-an-age-old-correlation-could-suggest-that-oils-troubles-arent-over-yamada.html
131,Want financial security? Home equity and retirement accounts are key,Personal Finance,31-05-2017,"A realtor holds an open house in Somerville, MA.Pat Greenhouse | The Boston Globe | Getty ImagesIt might seem obvious, even simplistic. But having home equity and retirement accounts are key to most families' financial assets and \xe2\x80\x94 by extension \xe2\x80\x94 retirement security.According to new research from the nonpartisan Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI), home equity and retirement accounts \xe2\x80\x94 401(k)-type plans and IRAs \xe2\x80\x94 account for nearly all the assets that many families have to depend on in retirement outside of Social Security and traditional pension plans.In its research, EBRI looked at the level of assets held by families with a working family head ages 25\xe2\x80\x9264 in so-called ""individual account"" retirement plans and compared those levels with all of their financial assets, as well as equity in their homes.More from USA Today:President Trump expected to withdraw from Paris climate agreement What is covfefe? Not even Merriam-Webster can explain Donald Trump's tweet Portland train stabbing victim: 'I'm just trying to heal and recover'And what EBRI discovered was this: Families with individual account retirement plans and home equity will have something to draw from for retirement expenses, outside of Social Security, while those families without retirement plans won't.So, what might those saving for or living in retirement do or not do given EBRI's findings?For those saving for retirement. Sterling Raskie, a certified financial planner with Blankenship Financial Planning recommends that you start saving for retirement as early as possible using either an employer-sponsored plan such as a 401(k) or an individual plan such as an IRA.And don't worry if you're not socking away as much as possible in your retirement accounts when you're in your late 20s, early 30s. The EBRI research seems to suggest that you'll build your nest egg over time. In fact, in the EBRI research, assets in retirement accounts represented 47.1% of all financial assets held in families with a working head of household ages 55-64.Buy a house. Consider buying a house if you don't own one, paying down your mortgage as fast as possible. Why? ""Home equity is a very important asset for American retirees, and so it is important to think about how to make best use of home equity in retirement planning,"" says Wade Pfau, professor of retirement income at The American College of Financial Services and author of Reverse Mortgages: How to use Reverse Mortgages to Secure Your Retirement.Others also say home equity is an important part of a sound retirement plan. ""Social Security and home equity are major pieces of the retirement puzzle,"" says Randy Bruns, a private wealth adviser with HighPoint Planning Partners.""But for most individuals, the primary focus is all too often how much has been saved in their retirement accounts.If you ask me, that's one of the biggest flaws I see in retirement planning.""Raskie also says homeowners who pay down their mortgage faster can boost the chances of a better retirement outlook. Paying down the principal on your mortgage will increase the value of your home equity. ""This can be considered a guaranteed rate of return with no risk,"" he says.Also, homeowners might evaluate what effect upgrading homes over the years might have on the value of their home equity. ""Understand the impact upgrading homes during a career or taking out a mortgage just before or in retirement can have on long-term financial goals,"" says Raskie.For those in retirement. Retirees who are concerned about cash flow \xe2\x80\x93 about having enough income to cover their expenses \xe2\x80\x93 might consider downsizing their homes if they don't need as much space, says Raksie.There are tax benefits to selling one's house worth noting as well. According to the IRS, if you sell your home at a significant profit (gain), some or all of that gain could be taxable. However, in most cases, if the home you sold counts as your main home, the first $250,000 of gain isn't taxable\xe2\x80\x94$500,000 if you are married and filing jointly. Read Publication 523, Selling Your Home.""Additionally, those with high amounts of home equity can consider using a reverse mortgage to insulate their retirement portfolio withdrawals and decrease the chances of portfolio failure,"" says Raskie.Randy Bruns, a private wealth adviser with HighPoint Planning Partners, also says a reverse mortgage is an important tool in the retirement-income toolbox. ""Reverse mortgages have become a critical component of retirement planning,"" he says. ""A reverse mortgage line of credit can greatly reduce sequence of return risk by providing timely access to cash so you won't have to sell investments until after markets have recovered. The hope is that a reverse mortgage line of credit can act as a standby source of liquidity in the kinds of instances that would otherwise lead to financial ruin for your portfolio.""Consider if and when debt useful. For those saving for and living in retirement, Raskie recommends ""carefully considering if and when any debt is necessary."" The EBRI research seems to suggest that those who prioritized savings versus debt, are in a much better position for retirement.Read EBRI's report,  Importance of Individual Account Retirement Plans and Home Equity in Family Total Wealth.Consider a balanced approach to retirement planning. ""The risks you'll face in retirement are unlike any you faced during your working years,"" says Bruns.""The more flexibility you build into your cash flow, the more likely you'll be to manage those risks.That's why a balanced approach using financial assets, home equity, and the optimal Social Security claiming decision deserves considerable attention as you transition into retirement.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/want-financial-security-home-equity-and-retirement-accounts-are-key.html

134,Planning your estate when you've got no children or heirs,Portfolio Perspective,31-05-2017,"Certified financial planner Mike Keeler has a client, a retired teacher, who saved diligently for her golden years and will leave behind a sizable estate when she passes away. Her estate-planning challenge, though, is that she has no children.It's a situation financial advisors come across frequently: Childless clients who are unsure what should happen to assets they leave behind or whom to appoint as their proxy decision-maker.""Sometimes there is no close family, and the person doesn't know who to leave their estate to,"" said Keeler, CEO of Peak Financial Solutions. ""They also don't know who to name as executor of their will or who they trust to make decisions for them if they are [incapacitated while still living]. These can be tough decisions.""Childless investors face unique challenges when making estate and health-care planning decisions.Hero Images | Getty ImagesWhile specific data on estate planning among the childless is hard to come by, studies show that most people fail to put in place even the most basic part of estate planning: a will. For instance, a 2016 Rocket Lawyer study conducted by Harris Poll shows that 64 percent of Americans lack that basic document.The problem with having no will (called dying intestate) is that your state's court system decides who gets your assets. And on top of property-related considerations are other important estate-planning components, regardless of marital or parental status.But decisions that can be hard enough for people with family ties or close friends become harder for those without those relationships. When that's the case, advisors start by encouraging people to focus on their interests and tie them to charitable giving.""I find out what they're passionate about,"" Keeler said. ""When they start thinking about the possibilities and the gears start turning in their heads, it can be a fun conversation.""More from Portfolio Perspective How to start saving for retirement in your 50s What makes an advisor trustworthy? Buying stock? Ask yourself this question firstKeeler's client, the retired teacher, decided to establish a foundation to award scholarships to college-bound kids who attended the at-risk middle school where she was a teacher. The scholarships will come with certain stipulations, all determined by the client.Keeler encouraged her to immediately establish her legacy so she can enjoy it while still living. The plan, Keeler said, is for the foundation to award its first scholarship this year.""I told her if you start gifting money now, you get to see the fruits of your labor,"" Keeler said. ""People don't have to wait until they're gone to do this.""Part of appropriately directing assets involves naming beneficiaries on financial accounts such as 401(k) plans and life insurance policies. Be aware that those accounts do not pass through the will. For instance, if you named your ex-husband as the beneficiary on your 401(k) plan and never updated that information, he will get that money even if your will names your new spouse as your only heir.An even trickier task than asset considerations can be choosing someone to have medical power of attorney. That designation lets the chosen person make important health-care decisions if you cannot.Married couples typically name each other as their health-care proxy. But after the death of one party to the marriage, the living spouse with no children faces the challenge of naming someone else. Same goes for childless singles who have never married.""They might feel like they are putting someone in a really difficult position,"" said Justin Halverson, co-founder of Great Waters Financial. ""Or they don't know who they would trust to make such an intimate decision"" when it comes to medical-care choices, he said.Another helpful tool is a living will, which states your wishes if you are on life support or suffer from a terminal condition. This helps guide your proxy's decision-making.In addition to a health-care power of attorney, it's important to give someone durable power of attorney to act as your agent if you become unable to tend to your finances. Advisors say many clients name different people to handle each health-care and financial decision.Additionally, naming an executor for your estate \xe2\x80\x94 regardless of its size \xe2\x80\x94 can be challenging.Doing something is better than doing nothing. Don't let the fact that you don't know the perfect way ... make you do nothing at all.Justin Halversonco-founder of Great Waters FinancialSometimes called a personal representative, the executor is the person legally charged with handling your estate. Duties can range from filing a will with the court to selling your house, paying your debts and distributing assets as directed.That individual will be asked to take on the responsibility no matter what else is going on in his or her life. This should be someone you not only trust, but a person with the capacity to handle the responsibility.Halverson said that if you struggle with naming someone, it's worth talking to your bank's trust division to explore naming the bank as executor or setting up a trust. Be aware that while family members or friends typically serve as executor for free, banks will charge a fee.The good news is that once you make these decisions, you don't have to think about your estate plan too often. Advisors say you should check it every three to five years unless you face a major life change.""The important thing is to document what you want to happen and review it periodically,"" said CFP Kevin Meehan, regional president of Wealth Enhancement Group. ""Relationships with people and charities can change.""For instance, one of Meehan's clients initially planned to leave a good chunk of her assets to nieces and nephews. But, he said, she recently changed her will.""That relationship has changed over time, and as [the nieces and nephews] are less interested in her, she's become less interested in giving her assets to them,"" Meehan said.While estate planning might be about as appealing as a root canal, advisors say that putting a plan in place gives you control that you otherwise won't have.""Doing something is better than doing nothing,"" said Halverson of Great Waters Financial. ""Don't let the fact that you don't know the perfect way to do [an estate plan] make you do nothing at all.""\xe2\x80\x94 By Sarah O'Brien, special to CNBC.com",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/estate-planning-when-youve-got-no-children-or-heirs.html
135,Departure of communications aide could be first in Trump shake-up,Politics,31-05-2017,"President Donald TrumpNicholas Kamm | AFP | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump's communications director is leaving the job, the White House said on Tuesday, as the president considers wider staff changes to try to contain political damage from investigations into Russia and his presidential campaign.Mike Dubke confirmed reports he had resigned, saying in a statement, ""It has been my great honor to serve President Trump and this administration."" Dubke, who had been in the job just three months, gave no reason for leaving.Trump, who returned to Washington on Saturday after a nine-day trip to the Middle East and Europe, has been expected to shake up staff to tackle the firestorm over investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and communication between Russia and Trump's campaign and transition team.Trump plans to bring in new aides to the White House, adding experienced political professionals including a former campaign manager, according to administration officials and people close to the president.Dubke, who was joined the White House in March to head the office that runs press and other public relations issues, oversees the White House's message strategy while spokesman Sean Spicer, a more high-profile figure, handles daily media briefings.The Republican president came home to face more questions on Russia after media reports about communications during and after the campaign between his son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, and Russia's ambassador to Washington.Spicer was asked on Tuesday whether Trump knew about reported efforts by Kushner in December to set up a back channel for communications with Russia.""What your question assumes is a lot of facts that are not substantiated by anything but anonymous sources that are so far being leaked out,"" he told a news briefing.More changes?Asked about a possible staff shake-up, Spicer said: ""I think the president is very pleased with his team and he has a robust agenda.""Dubke resigned just before Trump left on his foreign trip but will stay on until a transition is concluded, Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, said.Other potential staff changes could be in the works, according to Axios News, which first reported Dubke's departure, including fewer on-camera news briefings by Spicer, the White House press secretary.Trump also will take more questions directly from the media, Axios reported.""Ultimately the best messenger is the president himself,"" Spicer said on Tuesday.Senior adviser Kellyanne Conway told Fox News the White House will continue to bring in Cabinet secretaries and other top officials to handle news briefings on topics in their patch.Conway also dismissed persistent speculation that Spicer, who has been pilloried on TV comedy shows since Trump took office on Jan. 20, was on his way out.Controversy over the Russia issue deepened after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey earlier this month, leading to allegations by critics that the president sought to hamper the agency's investigation of the matter.Moscow has denied U.S. intelligence agencies' conclusion that it meddled in the campaign to try to tilt the election in Trump's favor.The president has denied any collusion, repeatedly denouncing the probes by a special counsel at the Justice Department, the FBI and several congressional panels as a Democrat-backed effort to explain Hillary Clinton's upset defeat in the White House race.Congressional investigations into the Russia issue have expanded to include Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, ABC News reported on Tuesday.Cohen confirmed he had been asked to provide information and testimony to investigators in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate but said he declined because ""the request was poorly phrased, overly broad and not capable of being answered,"" ABC reported.Cohen did not respond to Reuters' request to comment. The White House declined to comment, saying Cohen is not an employee of the administration.However, former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn, who resigned after failing to properly disclose his own contacts with Russian officials, told the Senate Intelligence Committee he will begin turning over some documents subpoenaed by the panel, a government source familiar with the matter told Reuters.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/departure-of-communications-aide-could-be-first-in-trump-shake-up.html

In fact, the fear of the machines taking over has been a familiar one throughout history.""This is the panic every 25 to 50 years,"" Andreessen said Tuesday evening at Recode's annual Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. ""It never comes true.""Andreessen, who developed the Netscape web browser and is the co-founder of VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, likens today's obsession with robots displacing people to the automobile 100 years ago and the fear that a new form of transportation would replace human labor. Instead, the auto industry turned into one of the nation's biggest employers and spawned a whole new market for people like street pavers.The self-driving car, Andreessen said, will not only save lives but increase productivity in ways that perhaps we're not even considering. The real problem in the labor market isn't an oversupply of people, but ""we don't have enough workers"" to fill the existing jobs. That situation could get a whole lot worse if ""immigration policies continue,"" he said.As with any emerging trend in technology, Silicon Valley is throwing excessive amounts of money at artificial intelligence. Venture investors are funding robots of every shape and size, creating ""one of the biggest booms I've ever seen,"" Andreessen said. And like with the early days of the internet and mobile, there will be a ton of losers, but a few big transformative winners.""Of course we're going to overdo it,"" he said. ""Out of that will come defining companies of the era.""Andreessen, who coined the phrase ""software is eating the world,"" is also investing in industries that have yet to experience the types of efficiencies that technology is supposed to create. The three markets of healthcare, education and construction account for 88 percent of all price inflation and are threatening to ""eat the economy,"" he said.Andreessen said he's investing in companies that are trying to drive down costs in those areas.

With Rubin's system, consumers could theoretically buy smart gadgets from a variety of brands and everything will just work together.Of course, there's always the chance Apple says no. Recode's Walt Mossberg asked what Rubin would do in that case. ""I'm gonna try. I have to lead the way. Consumers don't just want a single product in the living room.

That activity, along with consolidation in the space and positive margins, encourages her that there's more room to run.When it comes to Nvidia, which has risen nearly 36 percent so far this year, Gilbert said she ""loves the story"" but recognizes it's currently carrying a valuation akin to that of an established technology brand like Intel without the same kind of revenue.""We love the name; we like it more on a pullback,"" she said, and said selling upside calls (or selling downside puts for an entry point) is a better way to play the name than simply buying the stock, ""where we think valuation-wise it's just gotten ahead of itself.""

""In 2014 alone, pharmaceutical companies spent $168 million through sales reps peddling prescription opioids to win over doctors with smooth pitches and glossy brochures that downplayed the risks"" of the medicines,"" DeWine said at a press conference Wednesday. Last year, he said, 2.3 million people in Ohio, or about a fifth of the state's population, were prescribed opioids.In a statement, a spokesman for Purdue Pharma, which manufactures OxyContin, said the company shares the attorney general's concerns about the opioid crisis and that it is ""committed to working collaboratively to find solutions.""""OxyContin accounts for less than 2% of the opioid analgesic prescription market nationally, but we are an industry leader in the development of abuse-deterrent technology, advocating for the use of prescription drug monitoring programs and supporting access to Naloxone \xe2\x80\x94 all important components for combating the opioid crisis,"" he said.

""Janssen has acted appropriately, responsibly and in the best interests of patients regarding our opioid pain medications, which are FDA-approved and carry FDA-mandated warnings about the known risks of the medications on every product label,"" said Jessica Castles Smith, a Janssen spokeswoman.

DeWine said the Ohio suit, filed Wednesday morning in Ross County, ""would compel these companies to clean up this mess through several remedies,"" including an injunction to stop ""continued deception and misrepresentation in marketing,"" damages paid to the state for money spent on the crisis, and repayment to consumers.Sales of prescribed opioids \xe2\x80\x94 including oxycodone, hydrocodone and methadone \xe2\x80\x94 almost quadrupled in the U.S. between 1999 and 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, contributing to a more than quadrupling of deaths from prescription opioids in that same period. Almost 2 million Americans either abused or were dependent on prescription opioid painkillers in 2014, according to the CDC.In March, attorneys representing two West Virginia counties filed federal lawsuits against drug distributors, including AmerisourceBergen, McKesson and Cardinal Health, accusing companies of violating West Virginia law and threatening public health for distributing huge amounts of opioids in the state.The city of Everett, Washington, sued Purdue Pharma earlier this year, accusing the drugmaker of gross negligence and seeking payment for the costs of handling opioid addiction.

""But now that millennials feel the need to take selfies from cool locations all over the world, they're taking cruises like never before.""Watch the full segment here:VIDEO11:0511:05Cramer revisits this red-hot sector to see if it can cruise higherMad Money with Jim CramerCruise line executives are also driving the boom. Cruises have become more luxurious, stopping at more private islands and introducing celebrity chefs to their kitchens to draw customers.In fact, the industry is expected to spend $6.8 billion in 2017 on new ships that can handle 30,000 more passengers, an investment that is expected to continue through 2018 and 2019.""You don't spend that kind of dough unless you're feeling real confident about the future,"" Cramer said.Take Carnival, which turned around under the leadership of CEO Arnold Donald after one of its ships capsized off the coast of Italy several years ago, when cruises were much less popular.Carnival's purchasing power enabled Donald to cut costs by negotiating lower prices with suppliers. As cruises became more popular, Carnival also raised ticket prices because people were willing to pay up for experience and more on-deck amenities.This March, Carnival shares hit a record high on strong earnings and revenue beats, and the company raised its full-year earnings forecast, bullish signs that cruises are picking up steam.""And there's more cool stuff on the way \xe2\x80\x94 this fall, Carnival will be launching its Ocean Medallion program. That's an interactive platform that's meant to personalize your cruising experience. And, of course, they're still cutting costs while replacing old ships with more efficient new ones,"" Cramer added.Roger Frizzell, senior vice president and chief communications officer at Carnival, confirmed to CNBC that the market for cruising is expanding.""This is really a golden age for cruising,"" he said in an emailed statement. ""Cruising is the best vacation value available as well as an amazing vacation experience. We believe our new OCEAN Medallion concept rolling out in November will help transform the guest experience to even higher levels.""Then there is Royal Caribbean, which Cramer dubbed the group's best performer. In 2014, the company began an initiative to double its earnings by 2017 and reach double-digit returns on invested capital, and the ""Mad Money"" host said it looks like the company will pull it off.""In part, this strength is because of rising demand, but the company's also been very smart about cutting costs and providing customers with a superior product,"" he said.Royal Caribbean's last earnings report beat on earnings and was in line with revenue estimates. Like Carnival, it announced that bookings were up, on-board revenues were growing, and embracing technology was keeping the company's on-deck experience fresh.""The one piece of hair on this quarter? Well, it's kind of geopolitical,"" Cramer said. ""China and South Korea are feuding over this new Korean missile defense system, so Royal Caribbean has had to remove South Korean tour destinations from its Chinese cruises.""While that hurt Royal Caribbean's numbers, its strength in the rest of the world balanced the loss, Cramer said.Finally, Cramer turned to Norwegian Cruise, which came public in 2013. With a more modern fleet and strong routes that include an ""effective monopoly"" on Hawaiian cruises between the islands, the ""Mad Money"" host said the industry newbie has been showing its strength.""Now, Norwegian reported last \xe2\x80\x94 we got their results three weeks ago \xe2\x80\x94 and in a way it seemed like they were penalized for the strength of both Royal Caribbean and Carnival,"" Cramer said.Despite top and bottom line beats and strong guidance, Norwegian's stock slid after it reported, in part because of management's somewhat bearish commentary on the China-South Korea issue, and in part because investors were displeased with its large investments in marketing.""But I think it's been punished enough,"" Cramer said. ""The bookings were very, very strong worldwide on both volume and price, and marketing spending is just fine if it ends up pulling in more customers.""Andrea DeMarco, Norwegian Cruise Line's vice president of investor relations and corporate communications, said that she sees ""tons of potential"" in her company's growth prospects.""A lot of our metrics are industry-leading even though we're the smallest of the three cruise operators,"" she told CNBC, adding that as Norwegian is trading at the best value of the three major cruise lines, now would be a good time for investors to jump in.All in all, the cruise lines are not very expensive, with Carnival trading at 15 times next year's earnings, Royal Caribbean at 13 times, and Norwegian at 11 times 2018's expected numbers.""Here's the bottom line: even though the cruise stocks have roared higher this year, I think the whole industry has more room to run,"" Cramer concluded. ""The only problem is choosing among Carnival, Royal Caribbean, or Norwegian. I prefer Carnival \xe2\x80\x94 love that Arnold Donald \xe2\x80\x94 but really, I like 'em all and I bet they all go higher.""Questions for Cramer?Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

The company is one of the last big, national pizza chains not offering delivery. ""Our customers know that it is exceptionally fast to pick up a pizza [at Little Caesars] versus waiting 35 [to] 45 minutes or an hour for delivery,"" David Scrivano, CEO of Little Caesars, told CNBC.At a time when many other restaurant chains are adding delivery \xe2\x80\x94 including fast-food giants such as McDonald's \xe2\x80\x94 Little Caesars' business model relies heavily on ready-made pizzas, wings and crazy bread that customers can purchase with little to no wait time. Scrivano said its value proposition and convenience have made it one of the fastest-growing chains over the last decade.Many of Little Caesars' locations are in economically challenged communities, Darren Tristano, chief insights officer at Technomic, told CNBC. These customers are less likely to pay for delivery fees or tips, he said. ""Cost-conscious consumers will stop in as part of their regular routine and will find the Hot-N-Ready products within their definition of convenience,"" Tristano said. ""While everyone else is chasing delivery, Little Caesars is letting the customer come to them.""While the company currently has no plans to add an in-house delivery service, some customers can use third-party companies like Door Dash, GrubHub and Post Mates, among others, to purchase Little Caesars pizza and have it delivered. However, Scrivano said, the company doesn't create the online profiles for these delivery sites.""Not going into delivery does prevent Little Caesars from accessing a growing part of the market,"" Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, told CNBC. ""That said, the delivery market is already crowded and competitive, so the company would have to work hard to attain growth there, and may have to increase spending on advertising and marketing to do so.""Third-party services ease the financial burden of creating an in-house delivery operation and will placate customers who want the option of delivery, Saunders said.""In my view, the company considers its brand [to be] strong and unique enough to pull people into collecting from its stores,"" he said.While Little Caesars will not be developing its own delivery service, the chain is in the process of rolling out online and mobile ordering to its locations.""Everybody uses online ordering and expects to go on a mobile app,"" Scrivano said.Digital orders have increased by 45 percent since 2014, according to The NPD Group, and now account for nearly 1.7 billion in food service visits.In addition, mobile-order checks tend to be as much as 20 to 30 percent higher than a traditional in-store check. That's because customers have more time to consider their options, and restaurants are better able to offer upgrades and add-ons to meals to ring up a higher sale.Little Caesars' lower price point means a lower average check, but its convenience and innovative limited-time offers keep customers coming back.The chain has offered up bacon-wrapped pizza, bacon cheddar bites and pretzel pizza in the past for about $5 each. Most recently, Little Caesars has launched the ""ExtraMostBestest"" pizza, which is a regular-size pie with mozzarella, muenster cheese and more than 50 slices of pepperoni, for $6.""I think our customers like the variety, but come for the great value,"" Scrivano said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/why-little-caesars-doesnt-need-delivery-to-compete-in-the-restaurant-industry.html

That said, Microsoft's stock price has continued to go up under Ballmer's successor, Satya Nadella, who took over in February 2014. Ballmer said he thought Microsoft did do its part to drive up earnings, specifically producing profits. ""That's our controllable,"" he said. ""The stock price is not a controllable.""Nadella has been doing an excellent job as Microsoft's CEO, he said.Ballmer said he thought it was good that he stayed on the company's board when Nadella took over but then left the board when he bought the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team a few months later.""I've only been back on the Microsoft campus once, I think, since I've retired,"" Ballmer said.Speaking onstage on Tuesday at Recode's Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., Ballmer had told Recode's Kara Swisher and Kurt Wagner that Microsoft did not do enough to develop hardware capability during his tenure. In the interview, Ballmer built on those comments, saying that under his leadership the company did make a big investment in the HoloLens augmented reality headset, which was released in 2015.""Whether it's Microsoft or the competition, that's certainly what I've seen happen, but I'm glad to see energy happen on the topic, because it is the frontier of innovation,"" Ballmer said.Facebook and Snap are among the companies incorporating AR features into their apps.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/steve-ballmer-microsoft-stock-never-got-a-chance-to-move-when-i-was-ceo.html

147,Mary Meeker's 'future of the Internet' report shows how Silicon Valley thinks it can take over health care,Tech,31-05-2017,"VIDEO0:4500:45Here are the most interesting factoids from Mary Meeker's 2017 state of the internet presentationNews VideosMary Meeker, a partner at Kleiner Perkins, never much mentioned the medical sector in years past in her massive annual report on the future of the Internet. But this year, health care was a standout star with its own section. It's not all that surprising, given the rising interest from venture firms in the estimated $3 trillion sector. In 2016 alone, venture investors poured $4.2 billion into health-technology startups, according to the venture firm Rock Health.This year, internet in health-technology is showing no signs of letting up with Silicon Valley's venture capital firms increasingly hiring bio experts to help guide their investments, like computational biologists and doctors. Some tech firms are diving into regulated areas, in funding new diagnostic tests and drug discovery tools, while others are focusing on fitness, wellness and concierge medical care. Here are the highlights from the talk, which demonstrates how the tech sector thinks about opportunities in the space:Health data is going digital. The report cites a few examples of that, including measurements like blood pressure and electrocardiograms, which were once recorded on paper. Adoption of electronic medical records is also skyrocketing, in large part due to health reforms under the Obama Administration. And consumers continue to collect their own digital health data via wearables and apps. Hospitals and doctor's offices are finally starting to offer patients digital access to their own information. It's still early days in this trend, but it's happening in part due to pressure from technology companies and patients rights groups. Apple recently made it possible for consumers to access their medical records on a smartphone (more typically, it's shared on a CD-ROM or USB drive). Consumers are ordering more blood tests than ever before. Not mentioned in the presentation: The regulation hasn't caught up with this trend. Many lab tests are still in a regulatory grey area, meaning they can avoid federal oversight. That might well change in the coming years. It's also a trend that is concerning to many doctors, as any test comes with a risk of false positive or negative results. Hospitals increasingly have data storage and security needs on par with other industries. Meeker suggests that hospitals will have to deal with an average of 50 Petabytes of data. There's been a steady growth in clinical trials, which has attracted the interest of big tech companies. Apple's ResearchKit, for instance, is bringing us closer to mobile-based clinical trial recruitment. Moreover, with better data, Meeker cites research that suggests we can speed up the time it takes to bring a new drug to market. The rapidly-dropping price of whole genome sequencing has made Moore's Law look sedate. What cost hundreds of thousands, or even millions of dollars, just over a decade ago is now available for a few thousand dollars. Applied genomics has taken off, with more diagnostic tests on the market for genetic diseases than ever before.

And according to President and CEO Dion Weisler, it was a high school intern that prompted his team to create the company's new blockbuster printing device, the HP Sprocket.It started after a presentation HP's interns deliver to company executives, when Weisler asked the 14- and 15-year-olds if they print. Three of them said they did not \xe2\x80\x94 they had no need for it.""I said, 'Well, hang on a second, what about putting a photo on your wall?'"" the CEO told ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer on Wednesday. ""And with perfect innocence, this kid said to me, 'What, stick my phone on the wall?' And it was kind of at that point that we said, 'We've got to make print relevant. Emergency meeting, everybody. How are we going to do that?' and that's when the idea of the Sprocket came up.""Now the $129 device, which allows users to print photos directly from their smartphones, is on fire, perpetually out of stock at retailers like Amazon.Watch the full interview here:VIDEO7:3807:38HP Inc CEO says an intern helped spur 'the birth of a new category' in printingMad Money with Jim CramerAnd while Cramer said the mini-printer might be the ""hot gift"" of 2017 for those of the selfie generation, Weisler considers it as a symbol of something more.""We think it's just the birth of a new category,"" the CEO said. ""It's about reducing that glide slope of decline that we'd seen in home-based printing, and I think it's this kind of innovation that really is required and expected of market leaders.""And according to its latest earnings report, HP has been innovating since its split with Hewlett Packard Enterprises in 2015.The company saw revenues up 7 percent from a year ago, and this quarter marked the first time that the personal systems and print segments both rose for the first time since 2010.Weisler said that while innovation was the driving factor, cutting costs did play a role in what management called a ""breakthrough quarter"" for HP.""You've got to look at the market, you've got to be realistic. Get those costs under control. Then you start to think about, 'How can we innovate? How can we think through the lens of a customer and deliver sleek, beautiful designs, sprinkles of magic, deliver on a security promise across both printing and personal systems ... and, you know, do that in a cost envelope that really adds value to customers. And when you do that, it works,"" Weisler told Cramer.And as HP's 3-D printing business kicks off, Weisler sees massive opportunity ahead when it comes to changing the way companies manufacture products.""We see ways that we can really transform the way traditional manufacturing's done without warehouses and without tied-up cost to capital,"" the CEO said. ""In the future, we're going to democratize manufacturing in a way that really hasn't changed since the assembly line more than 100 years ago.""Questions for Cramer?

Because Hanoi maintains a strong position against Beijing's activities in the South China Sea, Trump may eye Vietnam as a potential counter to China in the disputed area, Baker explained.The world's second-largest economy claims 90 percent of the sea, home to over 250 islands and rich natural gas reserves, while Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan assert ownership of certain parts. And as Beijing ramps up island-building and military construction in the maritime region \xe2\x80\x94 reports recently emerged of Chinese rocket launchers in the Spratly Islands \xe2\x80\x94 Hanoi has not shied away from publicly denouncing the mainland.In 2014, Vietnam witnessed violent protests as demonstrators criticized China's assertiveness in the important waterway while Vietnamese officials lambasted Beijing in March after a Chinese cruise ship visited the Paracel Islands, which are claimed by both countries.China's territorial expansion has also irked Washington, with Trump promising vowing to halt Beijing's construction of artificial islands days after taking office. And while the president's hands are currently tied as he seeks the mainland's help on reigning in a hostile North Korea, the South China Sea issue still looms large \xe2\x80\x94 last week, the Chinese navy deployed two missile frigates to a U.S. Navy warship that sailed near the China-claimed Spratly Islands.The Vietnamese PM's visit to Washington ""adds momentum to a U.S.-Vietnam relationship that is moving in an increasingly strategic direction,"" Jonathan Stromseth, senior fellow at Brookings, described in a recent note.VIDEO1:2301:23Vietnam PM goes to Washington: What to expectSquawk Box AsiaIndeed, the two allies have already initiated a series of bilateral military exchanges that could raise eyebrows in Beijing.""Within the past week or so, Washington has delivered small vessels to the Vietnamese coast guard, there have been naval exchange visits (and) the U.S. has also waived some restrictions on arms exports to Vietnam,"" said Baker, adding that he expected this type of military cooperation to continue.Of course, Vietnam isn't Trump's sole ASEAN ally in the maritime conflict.The White House has been visibly cozying up to several Southeast Asian nations ""in the context of rising Chinese influence and growing concerns about the U.S. staying power in the region, particularly after (Washington's) withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership,"" Stromseth explained.Over the past month, Vice President Mike Pence has visited Indonesia, Trump has telephoned several ASEAN leaders, including controversial Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has hosted ASEAN foreign ministers in Washington.The White House's demonstrated commitment to the region could ""foster conditions that enable constructive multilateral engagement with China in the Asia-Pacific, helping to mitigate strategic rivalry between Washington and Beijing over the long term,"" Stromseth said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/trump-may-turn-to-vietnam-for-help-on-south-china-sea.html

(GAC) Trumpchi GS4 vehicle stands on display at the Auto Shanghai 2017 vehicle show in Shanghai, China, on Thursday, April 20, 2017.Qilai Shen | Bloomberg | Getty Images ""We called it Trumpchi in 2010,"" GAC Motor President Yu Jun told CNBC in his first international TV interview. ""We never imagined that seven years later the name would sound so similar to the name of President [Donald] Trump.""In China, Trumpchi (pronounced ""Trump-chee"") is an English take off the word ""Chuanqi"" which the president of Trumpchi prefers to translate as ""delivering goodness.""In case you're getting suspicious that the name is a Donald J. Trump brand rip-off, it's not uncommon for Chinese companies to fashion an English name out of Chinese one. For example in the car industry, Chery Auto is derived from ""Qirui"" in Chinese. Geely is ""Jili.""GAC's Yu said he plans to deliver a whole host of Trumpchi goodness to the U.S. when it enters the market in 2019. Trumpchi was the fastest-growing Chinese car brand in China last year and ranked highest among Chinese auto brands in research firm JD Power's 2016 quality survey.Trumpchi's progress in China has given it the confidence to believe it can beat the odds and do what no other Chinese car brand has been able to achieve for more than a decade: conquer the U.S.""GAC Motor has dreamed of becoming a world class brand. We have made great achievements domestically within a short period of time,"" Yu told me at a showroom in the company headquarters. ""American drivers are like Chinese drivers. They both like big sizes, big spaces and luxury interior.""For years, the Chinese have been attempting to build a globally competitive auto industry \xe2\x80\x94 and they've struggled.Chinese car brands have sold in emerging markets, yet exports have recently softened. The U.S. has been an elusive market for them \xe2\x80\x94 it's fiercely competitive and Americans have established brand loyalty.On top of that, fairly or unfairly, the ""made-in-China"" label has an image problem. So Trumpchi's efforts will be a gauge to see if Chinese automakers can upgrade themselves and compete on the international stage.VIDEO0:3900:39SUV construction in China""[The U.S.] has the highest standards \xe2\x80\x94 which is a good test for us,"" Yu said. ""If we can succeed in the U.S. market, we can succeed anywhere in the world.""The plan is first to export cars from Trumpchi's factories in China, but Yu said he's considering partnering with a U.S. automaker to produce locally. He sees potential to build his own American factory down the road.Despite the anti-China rhetoric and threats of a trade war out of the White House, Yu said Trumpchi is in it for the win.""Even if Trump imposes tariffs on imported cars, this will not diminish our desire or decision to enter the U.S. market,"" he said.Is the Trump name a help or a hindrance?""It's hard to say,"" he said while laughing. ""We're still trying to figure that out.""If he does, Trumpchi and China's auto industry might feel they are finally one step closer to being on top of the world.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/chinas-trumpchi-cars-eye-the-us-market.html

153,The newest extra for serious travelers: A mini-gym inside your hotel room,Real Estate,31-05-2017,"VIDEO2:1802:18Check out Hilton's new line of fitness hotel roomsGetting out of bed to exercise can be tough, especially when you're on the road. But what if your bed were right next to a gym? That is exactly what the Hilton Hotel group is banking on. The company\xc2\xa0is test-driving a new room that includes a miniature version of a fully-equipped gym.  For a premium of $45.00 per night, guests can reserve the ""Five Feet to Fitness"" package, which is a normal-sized room with a gym on one side, where the carpet ends. The cost is about the same as one class at a boutique fitness studio, like SoulCycle.  In the test room at Hilton's McLean, Virginia, property, on a sound-proof, wood-laminate floor, stands a large metal ""bay"" that holds sandbags, weight balls, a yoga mat, foam roller, Bosu ball, TRX training system and various other small pieces of workout paraphernalia. In the center of the bay is a screen with on-demand videos using and demonstrating the equipment.  ""We have always wanted to do a room that was built around movement and mindfulness,"" said Ryan Crabbe, senior director of Global Wellness for Hilton. ""Travelers are more and more interested in wellness trends and maintaining those routines and activities on the road, and we wanted to give them a room that did that.""Source: HiltonThe room also has a stationary bicycle for cardio and a meditation chair for mindfulness. The space is compact, but the options are wide \xe2\x80\x94 11 types of activities and programs. After testing a yoga and cardio room at the Tysons Corner Hilton three years ago, the feedback from guests was that they wanted more.""They love the convenience, they love the fact they didn't have to worry about going down to the fitness center and worrying about capacity issues,"" said Crabbe.What guests are sayingDownstairs at the McLean hotel's regular fitness center, where a long row of treadmills and ellipticals faces an indoor pool, and about a dozen varied weight machines and dumbbells line the opposite wall, Jack Brennan was doing crunches on a medicine ball. At around 11:30 in the morning, he was the only one there. Brennan said he travels a lot and always uses the hotel gym. Would he pay more to exercise in his room?  ""No, absolutely not, because I can get it all here. Why would I pay more to have it five steps away?"" said Brennan.  Pat and Jake Gosa are retired and also travel extensively. Both exercise regularly and both were intrigued by the gym-in-the-room concept.  ""I do a series of stretches before I ever walk out of the room, so for me that would be very convenient,"" said Pat.  The Gosas like the concept, but only if it doesn't sacrifice the usual hotel room amenities.  ""I would try it so as long as the room was comfortable and met all the reasons you stay in a hotel,"" said Jake. ""I don't want to be stumbling over gym equipment.""  They were also concerned about cleanliness and smell. The fitness room does have a special air filtration system, and the cleaning staff has received special training for the equipment.Opportunity for fitness brandsThe fitness competition in the hospitality sector is only heating up. Westin recently announced a partnership with Peloton, the interactive, social cycling platform. Westin has already added the stationary bicycles to 50 of its properties in the U.S., and not only to its gyms but also to some guest rooms.  ""Hotels are looking for a way to differentiate themselves,"" said John Foley, CEO of Peloton. ""More people see fitness as part of their vacation. You don't want to go backwards when you're on the beach, you want to go forward.""  Peloton is exclusive with Westin for six months, but Foley clearly expects to expand the reach to other hotels around the world.  ""Over time, we'll see how it goes,"" he said, adding that the Westin Pelotons were already ""oversubscribed.""  The opportunity for fitness brands to capitalize on visibility at hotels is vast. Both equipment and digital video makers can introduce themselves to thousands of potential customers from around the world. Hilton's fitness rooms cost the hotel franchise owners upwards of $12,000 each to implement, but it should take only about a year to see a return on the investment, according to Crabbe. So far they are being offered in Hilton, Doubletree and Curio brands, but could move to other, lower-priced properties.  ""We have brands like Hilton Garden Inn, Embassy Suites and extended stay that have already told us their customers are hungry for this, so all of that stuff is currently being designed and researched,"" said Crabbe.  The room may be small, but the opportunity is not. As the global fitness craze expands and active baby boomers begin their years of retirement travel, more hotels will likely find more innovative ways to work in a workout.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/travel-hotels-pu-t-mini-gyms-inside-guest-rooms.html

155,Election shock? Why you now need to sit up and take note of UK politics,UK Election 2017,31-05-2017,"VIDEO4:1804:18Challenges the Conservatives face ahead of UK electionSquawk Box EuropeA hastily-arranged General Election in the U.K. - that was seen as a foregone conclusion - has suddenly sprung into life with polls tightening and some market analysts speaking about outcomes that would have been inconceivable just weeks ago.Britain's left-wing Labour party have steadily bridged a seemingly unassailable gap on the ruling right-wing Conservatives in the run-up to the election on June 8, with the latest opinion polls forcing investors to entertain the possibility of a third political shock in as many years.With investors resolutely aware of the predictably unpredictable nature of U.K. politics, CNBC takes a look at how the race for Downing Street has evolved and whether there really could be a shock in store.Polls continue to narrow""Investors are now starting to consider whether history might be about to repeat itself following an almost continuous decline in the government's opinion poll standing since the election was called,"" Paul Meggysei, strategist at JPMorgan, said in a note on Friday.Until two weeks ago, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May had appeared on track to secure a landslide parliamentary majority for the governing Conservative party. She had called the early vote, despite repeatedly saying she would not do so, in an attempt to secure a strong mandate during Brexit negotiations and presumably to increase the 17-seat lead that she currently has in the House of Commons.Prime Minister Theresa May attends the London Conference on Somalia at Lancaster House on May 11, 2017 in London, England.Jack Hill - WPA Pool | Getty ImagesHowever, on Wednesday, the latest average forecast from YouGov projected May's Conservatives could actually lose seats. While the recent opinion polls show the prime minister's party maintains a slender lead, the Conservatives' diminishing advantage is likely to spur on their political rivals with just eight days to go until the election. The YouGov projections show that she could even have 16 seats less than she needs for a majority, thus meaning that a coalition government would be needed to rule. This would decrease May's ability to push through any reforms and regulations.There's even a very unlikely outcome whereby the opposition Labour party could team up with the Scottish Nationalist Party in the result of a hung parliament \xe2\x80\x93 where no-one has a clear majority - and challenge the Conservatives for power.""When approaching the final few weeks of election campaigns momentum matters and it is currently with Labour,"" analysts at Nomura said in a note last week.""A surprise surge in the 'underdog' happened in 1997 and 2001 in the final two weeks of the campaigns. While that was to the detriment of the Labour party and not enough to provide an upset, it acts as a reminder that polls can continue to narrow even in such a short space of time,"" Nomura analysts added.Why is this happening?\xc2\xa0Martin Boon, the director of polling firm ICM, said Tuesday that he expected nerves to be jangling in the Conservative party headquarters.""The dramatic shifts in polling numbers have been argued in many places to be a function of a sudden surge in young voters and/or 2015 non-voters, motivated by Jeremy Corbyn's populist platform including the abolition of student tuition fees and return to state funded grants,"" Boon said.In a separate YouGov poll published Tuesday, the Labour party was projected to be 57 points ahead of the Conservatives among people aged under 25-years-old. While younger voters are traditionally viewed as being less reliable to turn out on election day, only 12 percent of 18-24-year-olds said they would vote Conservative on June 8 with 69 percent indicating Labour would receive their vote.Sterling 'heavily tilted towards the downside'VIDEO3:2203:22See sterling bouncing around high $1.20s for most of Brexit process: ProSquawk Box EuropeSterling slipped on Wednesday morning after the fresh polling data suggested a hung parliament. However, just a few hours later a separate poll published by research firm Panelbase showed the Conservative party held a 15 percentage point lead. As a result, the pound trimmed some of its losses to trade 0.1 percent lower against the dollar for the session.""The near-term risks to sterling remain heavily tilted to the downside,"" Samuel Tombs, chief U.K. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a research note on Tuesday. ""Sterling is about 2 percent higher than when the election was called suggesting markets remain positioned for a big Tory (Conservative party) win that - in theory - would strengthen May's hands in Brexit talks,"" Tombs added.JPMorgan analysts suggested in a research note published Friday that sterling would most likely rise in the immediate aftermath of a Corbyn victory, whereas Nomura researchers argued it was more likely investors would sell the U.K. currency, leading to an immediate fall.Yet strategists from both banks predicted a softer Brexit stance from Labour would ultimately be positive for sterling beyond the near term.Labour's Corbyn has vowed to pursue a so-called softer approach towards Brexit, when compared to the Conservative party, as he has pledged to secure the benefits of the EU's single market \xe2\x80\x93 a tariff-free trading bloc for goods and services - and promised a more open immigration policy.""The last two weeks have been traumatic for the Conservative campaign ... Attention has veered off Brexit after deeply unpopular education and social care plans were announced in the Conservative manifesto, while the Labour Party's own policy proposals appear to have been effective at attracting (center-left) Liberal Democrat voters,"" Deutsche Bank analysts, led by chief economist Mark Wall, said in a research note on Tuesday. Pollsters 'off my Christmas card' listWhile the polls show an increasing uptick in support for Corbyn's Labour party, historically these same polling forecasts have typically overstated the popularity of the left-wing party.Two years ago, then Labour leader Ed Miliband suffered a disastrous result in the General Election as, despite predictions of a hung parliament. Conservative leader David Cameron pulled off an unexpected victory to become prime minister. He defied bookmaker odds of around 90 percent for a hung parliament.In response to the latest opinion polls, Miliband said on Twitter, ""The pollsters have been off my Christmas card since 2015 #justsaying.""Tweet 1For those who have completely lost faith in opinion polling given the numerous political surprises in recent years, the betting markets could prove a more reliable source of analysis as political gamblers weigh the probabilities of each potential outcome.""Before getting carried away, it should be noted that the betting markets still have the Conservatives as overwhelming favorites to secure a majority, even though the odds on this have fallen by 5% to 86%,"" JP Morgan's Meggysei added.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

157,"Moody's raises outlook for Singapore banks to stable, as drag from oil and gas exposure eases",Banks,30-05-2017,"VIDEO2:2102:21Moody's raises Singapore banks' outlook to stableSquawk Box AsiaMoody's Investors Service raised Singapore banks' outlook to stable from negative on Wednesday, citing stabilizing commodity prices and improving growth conditions.The ratings agency said deterioration in the asset portion of balance sheets had peaked, particularly among oil and gas exposure.""Economic growth in Singapore is picking up and growth is also picking up in other parts of Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), so this is positive for the banks,"" Eugene Tarzimanov, a senior credit officer at Moody's, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Wednesday.""Another factor is we think new NPL (non-performing loan) formation, or the rate that banks get new problematic assets: This rate is decreasing. So that's a good thing. Banks will get less problematic assets this year and next,"" he added.Tarzimanov said bank profitability was also expected to improve ""mildly"" as net interest margins (NIM) could rise as interest rates increase, in line with monetary tightening in the U.S., and the amount of provisions needed should decrease.Moody's said it expected Aaa-rated Singapore's real gross domestic product growth to rise to 2.2 percent this year and 2.5 percent in 2018, from 2 percent in 2016, with credit growth rebounding to mid-single digits after being flat in 2016.The oil and gas sector proved a drag on the sector after the sharp drop in oil prices forced Singapore oil service player Swiber Holdings into bankruptcy. Another Singapore oil-service company, Ezra Holdings, also failed to repay debt.Singapore's three banks \xe2\x80\x94 DBS, United Overseas Bank and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. \xe2\x80\x94 were required to put aside more money to cover their exposure to bad loans to the beleaguered sector.But after earnings were released earlier this month, DBS CEO Piyush Gupta told CNBC that, although he expected more bad loans from the oil services sector, the worst was likely over.Automated teller machines of the three Singapore-listed banks: OCBC, DBS and UOB.Munshi Ahmed | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhile Moody's expected domestic problem loans would mainly come from the vulnerable borrowers in the corporate sector, it expected household loan delinquencies should remain low. ""Household credit growth in recent years was constrained by macroprudential measures. These loans are dominated by secured loans, namely mortgages, which enjoyed low non-performing loan levels of 0.4 percent,"" Moody's said.It noted that the average mortgage loan-to-value (LTV) ratio was at 53 percent at the end of last year, while less than 5 percent of housing loans had LTV ratios above 80 percent, with banks prohibited from originating those loans in Singapore since 2013. In December, Moody's downgraded the three banks to a1 from aa3, citing increased asset quality and profitability risks.But the ratings agency kept the banks' senior debt rating at Aa1, three notches above the baseline rating, as Moody's expected the Singapore government would step in with strong support if the banks needed it.At the end of last year, the three banks had a domestic loan market share of around 50 percent and around 63 percent of the domestic deposit market, Moody's noted.

Hillary Rodham Clinton isn't merely in a state of denial. She has become Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense. Politically speaking, she is dead, but she doesn't know it. Her staffers are so many Haley Joel Osments \xe2\x80\x94 too kind (and too attached to their salaries) to tell her that her career is over. She doesn't need briefings. She doesn't need to do interviews. She doesn't need to write the book she is writing (after so many indigestible volumes, why bother with one more?).Clinton was eager to show the Washington political hacks that she is still a tough operator, a leader of the anti-Trump movement, a player.\xc2\xa0She doesn't need to stake out a politically nuanced position on James Comey's firing or scramble to get out in front of the Resistance parade. She lost two exceedingly winnable presidential campaigns in Hindenburgian fashion. There is no demand for her to run again and there is nothing left for her except to receive whatever ceremonial honors and sinecures may come her way. She has been handed her political retirement papers by the American people. She's done.  Clinton tells Traister, vaguely, ""Take me out of the equation as a candidate. You know, I'm not running for anything,"" and indeed she isn't, right now, since this isn't an election year. Yet nothing Clinton does these days makes sense unless you keep in mind that she actually thinks she could run again.VIDEO5:2505:25Clinton: Democrats can take the House backClosing BellTake her Wellesley address on Friday: utterly bonkers for a commencement speech. Newly minted graduates expect to hear something useful or at least funny or informative or, failing all else, sentimental. Clinton did a bit of this, then started lobbing word-mortars far over their heads at Donald Trump, making the kinds of Nixon comparisons that every Democrat, and lots of non-Democrats, have been making for months.Why bother pursuing such a trite theme? Because Clinton was eager to show the Washington political hacks that she is still a tough operator, a leader of the anti-Trump movement, a player. She was, in other words, campaigning. To all appearances, the game is long over. Yet she is still on the field, because the game isn't over to her. Hey, there's another election in three and a half years, folks. And need we remind you who won the popular vote?In Traister's profile, Clinton (again) deflects attention from her own self-evident flaws to blame her defeat on others. She again blames James Comey, with zero acknowledgment that her own actions to evade scrutiny of her e-mail were the cause of Comey's entirely justified and indeed shockingly forgiving criminal investigation. She (again) blames the Russians, even though even she acknowledges that the actual content of the WikiLeaks e-mails from her own fellow Democrats was ""inconsequential.""She (again) blames misogyny, a non-falsifiable theory with no evidence behind it except that citizens supposedly came up to her and said things like, ""Gosh, I'm not sure we're ready for a woman president,"" with the added fillip that women who voted against her are internalized misogynists. She blames ""the suppression of the vote, particularly in Wisconsin,"" channeling an investigation from progressive fantasists published in The Nation that is so lacking in credibility that it was debunked by Slate and ignored by most of the Hillary-friendly media.Clinton does not mention that she made more campaign stops in Arizona than in Wisconsin. She forgets that she ignored the advice of her own husband that it was unwise to write off white working-class voters. She does not allude to her having hidden from the public a bout with pneumonia until she was forced to release information when a random bystander happened to make a video of her collapsing on a mild day in New York City. She doesn't reflect on her uninspiring speeches or her off-putting personality. Traister doesn't press her on any of these matters, and the anticipation of that treatment is why Clinton agreed to speak to someone like Traister in the first place.In lieu of all of this, Clinton seeks to present herself as the most forceful opponent of the Trump administration. Should the president be impeached, she'll be able to say: Hey, I called it! But she isn't leading the national conversation, she's mouthing along with it, like any other retiree talking back to cable news at home. Even if the Trump administration proves to be the catastrophe she foresees, there is no reason the Democrats would turn back to her for a third run. Every time she draws attention to the Trumpian flaws that were conspicuous to all during the campaign, she doesn't hear the obvious rejoinder echoing in every American's mind: Then why couldn't you trounce him?Commentary by Kyle Smith, critic-at-large at National Review.

160,"The high-yielding utilities sector is surging this year, and some say the best is still ahead",Trading Nation,30-05-2017,"VIDEO2:4702:47Trading Nation: Record high for utilitiesTrading NationIs a good defense the best offense? The ""defensive"" utilities sector has beaten the market this year, and hit an all-time high Tuesday.The impressive performance led Evercore ISI technician Rich Ross to comment Tuesday on CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" that ""regardless of what you think about the world or interest rates, in isolation the charts of the utilities are a buy.""On a chart of the utilities-tracking ETF XLU, Ross points out that the sector has broken out of a ""12-month base of support"" with XLU forming a ""bull flag"" over the last few months, a pattern that normally precedes another rally. According to Ross, these short-term technicals are pointing to potentially $60 for utilities, a 12 percent rally from Tuesday's levels.But he also points out that he sees another indicator that utilities are headed for more record highs. Not only has the XLU held a ""150-week moving average now for almost seven years,"" but a rise in bond yields hasn't tempered the rally.""You're at a new all-time high on the utilities, but the yields are not back down near their lows of 1.30 percent,"" the technician said. ""So yes, clearly [utilities] are a proxy for interest rates, but whether those interest rates have been rising or just moving sideways, utilities continue to move forward. [That is] a bullish divergence that tells me you want to be a buyer here of this breakout.""Like many high-yielding stocks and sectors, utilities do tend to enjoy a close relationship with interest rates. The XLU has a dividend yield of more than 3 percent, which is significantly above that of the  and of the U.S. 10-year Treasury note. Stocks with high yields often rise when interest rates fall, since the lower yields in the bond market can make holding high-dividend stocks a more attractive prospect.Susquehanna's Stacey Gilbert, however, doesn't necessarily believe that the sector is a buy. The head of derivatives strategy said that since the sector's valuation is ""rich,"" she would not ""love adding more money to it.""Gilbert did, however, suggest a way to play the sector.""One of the areas that I do think is interesting that I really like that investors are implementing is looking at the individual names and overwriting, selling upside calls against long holdings,"" she said. ""[That enhances] some of that yield more rather than recognizing levels where they think the stocks have gotten ahead of themselves. I think that's the right way to play the sector now.""For a trader who owns a stock and sells a call option, upside is capped, but in return for that, the trader receives extra yield as well as a bit of protection to the downside. The S&P 500 utilities sector is now up 9.6 percent year to date, while the S&P 500 has risen by 7.8 percent.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/30/the-high-yielding-utilities-sector-is-surging-this-year-and-some-say-the-best-is-still-ahead.html

The move is no surprise, said analysts, given Trump campaigned on boosting fossil fuel output and reviving the coal industry.""Domestically Trump does probably have quite a lot to gain from his core base by pulling out of something that is seen to negatively affect the prospects of coal,"" said Paul McConnell, research director of global trends at energy research firm Wood Mackenzie.The notion of a trade battle over climate change is something everyone's tried to avoid for two or three decades. That's why we have an international agreement to put everyone in the same frameDirk ForristerInternational Emissions Trading Organization president and CEOBut backing out of the deal will do little to increase demand for fossil fuels, he said. In the United States, higher energy efficiency, falling renewable energy prices, abundant natural gas, and the rise of electric vehicles and smart grids will continue to displace coal and oil, McConnell and other analysts told CNBC.VIDEO4:1504:15Trump considering exit from Paris climate change dealPower Lunch""Will pulling out of the Paris Agreement save coal? I suspect that renewables and gas will have more to say about that than anything else,"" he said.Trump could actually cut off a path to making coal more viable, said Jonathan Elkind, former assistant secretary for the U.S. Energy Department's Office of International Affairs under President Barack Obama. Without the United States at the table, necessary investments in clean coal technology and next-generation nuclear plants could take a backseat to wind and solar energy.A ""risk that arises from the U.S. leaving is that people take what I think would be an inefficient and unwise but kind of bumper sticker-friendly approach to the climate issue,"" said Elkind, who is now a fellow at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.Indeed, coal companies like Cloud Peak Energy and Peabody Energy argued for staying in the Paris Agreement to influence coal's role in the global energy mix.A U.S. exit from the Paris Agreement also raises the risk of trade disputes.VIDEO2:1302:13Trump leans toward pulling out of Paris climate dealPower LunchThe United States is the world's second-largest emitter of carbon dioxide. Its trade partners could argue they are at a disadvantage if the United States frees its companies from the burden of climate regulations, analysts said.Many of the biggest U.S. trade partners, including the European Union, Canada, Mexico and China already have or will soon implement carbon trading systems to cap the amount of CO2 companies are allowed to emit.Dirk Forrister, president and CEO of the nonprofit International Emissions Trading Organization,  noted that some foreign officials have raised the prospect of imposing a ""carbon tariff"" on U.S. products, but said that is uncharted territory and would have serious consequences.""The notion of a trade battle over climate change is something everyone's tried to avoid for two or three decades.

Instead, she thinks more targeted tariffs on parts of the U.S. economy could gain momentum.But Elkind, the former Obama official, suggested some nations may have little patience for the United States, given that the Paris Agreement gives signatories significant flexibility to set climate policies based on their individual circumstances.""If one of the biggest emitters doesn't wish to take advantage of that flexibility and stay part of the solution, I bet it will only embolden those who want to reach for more punitive approaches,"" he said.Watch: Will Musk dump Trump over Paris climate dealVIDEO4:1104:11Will Musk dump Trump over possible Paris climate deal withdrawal?Fast Money",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/trump-has-much-to-lose-by-backing-out-of-paris-agreement-analysts-say.html
164,"The ultimate dream escape: An undersea luxury hotel for $2,500 a night",Iconic Tour,31-05-2017,"Right now it's only a dream. But if Planet Ocean Underwater Hotels' founder and managing director, Tony Webb, gets his way, it could change the way people think about their next vacation \xe2\x80\x94 and help the environment at the same time.In April the company announced its intention to partner with the hotel industry and open the world's latest underwater luxury boutique hotel. Furthermore, the company said that it had already submitted its business plan to both the U.S. State Department and the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control, in order to gain approval to operate in Cuba's waters.Planet Ocean has chosen 15 undersea sites for its hotels and the coral reef restoration efforts that are part of its stated mission. The proposed sites include locations in the Indian Ocean, the Persian Gulf, the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean. Each hotel will sit 30 feet below sea level and afford its guests intimate views of exotic undersea life. According to its business plan, Planet Ocean plans to invest 5 percent of the total hotel construction cost in marine conservation, with a commitment of 10 percent of guest room proceeds to be invested in coral reef restoration.It's an ambitious concept and the brainchild of Webb, a former tech executive and space expert, who wasn't even thinking about creating tourist sites on the planet Earth. ""In the year 2001, I hired a lottery consultant for my international space tourism lottery,"" Webb told CNBC. ""He was also very well versed with miniature submarines.""More from iCONIC:The best city for small business is not in Silicon ValleyWhy Peter Thiel, believes in this 22-year-old's plan to clean up the oceans  This guy is keeping Elon Musk's employees healthy \xe2\x80\x94 and raking in $30 million a yearThe two men had intended to discuss space tourism, but the topic of ""inner space"" \xe2\x80\x94 which the Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines as ""space at or near the Earth's surface and especially under the sea"" \xe2\x80\x94 kept intruding on their conversation.  ""From there on, inner space was always on my mind,"" he said.Although Webb had spent more than a decade developing a space tourism model, the idea of building hotels underwater simply wouldn't let go. So in 2013 he shut down his space tourism effort and gave his undivided attention to the world beneath the sea. He was awarded a patent for his idea two years ago that would make the hotel \xe2\x80\x94 modeled after the International Space Station \xe2\x80\x94 a movable, modular vessel composed of 12 rooms that can be moved if possible, to keep guests safe from hurricanes.Each pod would come with a king-size bed, bathroom, internet and massive panoramic acrylic windows looking out onto the ocean floor. And they would be outfitted with flotation side bags so there would be no risk of sinking. Guests would take an elevator down from the surface level into the main lobby, which would also have a restaurant, event rooms and observation areas.A new frontier in tourismThe idea of an underwater hotel is certainly novel, and one could be forgiven for thinking it's far-fetched. However, the hotel industry has always attracted people who have looked at the untamed wild and asked, ""Why not?"" Even legendary hotelier Conrad Hilton once famously intended to put one of his facilities on the moon.  If a new frontier is to be conquered, then its technical challenges must be met. An underwater dwelling is no different, but Webb has drawn upon years of experience in the construction industry to help him meet these challenges.""The two basic fabrication materials are steel and acrylic,"" Webb said, noting that the structure must be able to withstand the punishment dealt out by hurricanes and cyclonic storms. But if a weather event should take place that's truly biblical in nature, the hotel has been designed to rise to the ocean surface and wait it out.""Using our top-secret ballast-control system, we have the ability to quickly surface the underwater hotel, attach our support vessel towlines, and use our 10 internal-battery bank electric power propulsion systems that are welded to the underwater hotel,"" he said. ""We will arrive safely to our pre-planned hurricane protection hole.""High cost of luxuryNeedless to say, a project of this sort can't be done on the cheap. However, Webb's estimate for the price of each facility seems low, when put in context.""We are selling 15 locations for $3 million each,"" he said. ""With previous proposed underwater hotels, their costs were above $200 million. ... My objective is to fabricate at cost, so the daily room rate will be affordable.""Webb isn't worried about attracting investors. He anticipated that the hotel industry as a whole will want to be a part of the adventure, and he specifically mentioned Sir Richard Branson as someone who would be naturally predisposed towards investing in such a forward-looking venture. He added that room rates will be so reasonable that the hotel should have no trouble attracting guests.""In my document to the Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control, we showed a two-guest room rate of $2,500,"" he said. ""Our original rate was from $3,000 to $6,000.""  Webb suggested that those balking at this rate should log on to Google and enter the terms ""what is the most fascinating luxury room in the world"" in the search field.  ""You will discover our rates are very reasonable,"" he said. Since his suggested Google search turns up such results as the $86,000-a-night Grand Penthouse at New York City's Mark Hotel, one must conclude that he knows what he's talking about. He also added that compared to space tourism, Planet Ocean room rates are a steal, and the environment allows guests to enjoy their stay the right way.  ""In my 13 years of dedicated space tourism, the suborbital space flight cost is 50 times greater and there will be no sex in space,"" he said.Webb said that he was certain that once the investors have come aboard and the hotel is open to the public, keeping the rooms booked won't be a problem.""I have received thousands of comments from the public,"" he said. ""There are millions of people who would love to stay the night. I am certain that the day we begin fabrication and begin to accept reservations, we will be sold out in the first week.""\xe2\x80\x94 By Daniel Bukszpan, special to CNBC.com",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/the-ultimate-dream-escape-an-underwater-luxury-hotel-for-2500.html

The reality is that for any business it needs also to invest and innovate and what you find is the cost of regulatory change is starting to crowd out your ability to make other investment,"" he asserted.VIDEO3:3903:39Asset management industry is very strong: Janus-Henderson co-CEOSquawk Box EuropeAnother key pressure seen to be driving a wave of consolidation within the asset management space - which is expected to only intensify in coming years - concerns fees, with passive and low-cost fund options growing in scope, availability and popularity.Yet Formica claims that fee pressure is just ""the nature of our industry"" and that the threat from passive management \xe2\x80\x93 which currently claims around 38 percent of assets under management according to Bernstein Research \xe2\x80\x93 is not necessarily driving the long-term trend towards fund manager consolidation.Important clients of asset managers, such as banks and insurers who often act as intermediaries are also confronted by pressures which prompt consolidation and are increasingly keen to secure a more limited pool of global financial partners to work with, according to the co-CEO.""The changes they face from regulation are changing the way they look to partner with firms such as ours,"" he noted, speaking to the rationale for the wave of consolidation sweeping through the broader global financial landscape.Bill Gross, portfolio manager, Janus Capital.Source: Janus CapitalFormica joins from Henderson, where he had been CEO since 2008. The U.K.-based fund management firm had not delved into machine learning techniques before but now has Janus's INTECH as part of its expanded combined product suite. The quantitative equities platform, which has been managing institutional money since 1987, will be part of a larger focus for Janus Henderson on opportunities in the machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data space going forward, says Formica.""You will see us continue to invest in new areas and see if we can improve the way our fund managers deliver the returns they do for our clients,"" he declared, adding that it was ""absolutely"" a key area of focus for the firm.""When I started in the industry 25 years ago you went out and sought ideas. Now there is so much information available the question is how to use it and become effective in that,"" he explained.This summer will mark three years since PIMCO-founder and legendary bond investor Bill Gross departed his home of over forty years in Newport Beach to join Janus in Denver, Colorado.

166,Kremlin gathers experts to tackle Russia\xe2\x80\x99s anaemic growth,World Economy,31-05-2017,"Russia's President Vladimir PutinMikhail Klimentyev | TASS | Getty ImagesBusiness leaders and government officials from Russia and abroad are likely to get an unexpected exposure to raw political campaigning at the country's largest annual economic conference in St Petersburg on Thursday.Russia's struggling economy is at the centre of a beauty contest arranged by president Vladimir Putin, who has ordered a clutch of advisers to submit competing plans for a strategy to pep up growth.Russia emerged from a two-year recession at the end of last year but growth remains anaemic \xe2\x80\x94 far below the 3 per cent the Kremlin would like \xe2\x80\x94 and the exchanges over rival plans are getting increasingly heated as Mr Putin seeks the policies to decorate what is expected to be the formality of a comfortable election victory next March.More from Financial Times:  EU and China strengthen climate ties to counter US retreatStrong debut boosts Macron's prospects in French national pollsAlphabet's Nest launches update to home security camera""In the autumn, when the president officially decides to run, he will use these materials for his campaign programme,"" says Yevgeny Gontmakher, an economist and former government official.Russia's challenges are well known. It is over-dependent on oil and gas exports; it is failing to secure enough investment to modernise its ageing infrastructure; and productivity is struggling to keep up with wage growth driven by a shrinking labour force.But the debate over meeting these challenges has gained new urgency because Mr Putin has failed to deliver on promises he made at the start of his current term to create millions of high-end jobs, improve education and health services and steeply raise real wages. As a result of the latest recession, triggered in 2014 by the oil price crash and western sanctions, real incomes have dropped sharply.Russia is one of the five countries with the highest level of social security contributions for employers in the world.Vladimir Nazarovdirector of the Financial Research Institute, a think-tank backed by the finance ministryThe Russian government says gross domestic product will increase by 2 per cent this year, but only 1.5 per cent annually in the following years. The World Bank expects only 1.3 per cent growth this year and 1.4 per cent in 2018 and 2019.The Kremlin says the dim outlook is even becoming a security concern, with an economic security strategy approved this month citing slow growth, budget imbalances and widening income disparities as security risks.Mr Putin's advisers are showing varying degrees of ambition in their proposals. Although Mr Putin asked for comprehensive policy strategies and each politician is lobbying hard for his respective plan, Kremlin officials have said the president might cherry-pick individual measures.Alexei Kudrin, one of Mr Putin's most senior economic advisers, argues that modernising the bureaucracy, reforming the courts, rolling back the state's role in the economy, and radically overhauling education and the labour market are indispensable. His strategy would entail far-reaching changes to the institutions of governance \xe2\x80\x94 leading many to think it is too political for Mr Putin to embrace in its entirety.The Stolypin Club, a group headed by Boris Titov, ombudsman for entrepreneurial rights, has put forward proposals that steer clear of politics. But the group's calls for a partial rollback of the flexible exchange rate system, a looser monetary policy and subsidised corporate loans call into question the key policies of the Central Bank, whose governor Elvira Nabiullina has earned Mr Putin's trust by helping the country weather the storm of oil price shock and western sanctions.Prime minister Dmitry Medvedev, meanwhile, has submitted a policy agenda that analysts call the most realistic and flexible but also the least ambitious of the three, since it largely entails minor tweaks in various sectors. Its one big structural reform idea is a proposal to cut employers' social security contributions and raise value added tax, aimed at making Russian manufacturers more competitive and formalising parts of the large grey economy.However Mr Titov warns a VAT increase would strangle badly-needed consumer demand, while Mr Kudrin fears that cutting employers' social security contributions will complicate reform of Russia's pension system.The government has clamped down on public discussion of its plan until after the election but internally, the cabinet appears to be moving ahead. ""They are ready to push the button as soon as the election is over,"" said an economist briefed on the issue.Vladimir Nazarov, director of the Financial Research Institute, a think-tank backed by the finance ministry, says: ""Russia is one of the five countries with the highest level of social security contributions for employers in the world."" He points to Germany's success in making its exporters more competitive through labour market and social security reforms. However some experts caution that the plan may fail to improve productivity unless Moscow also makes the labour market more flexible. Proposals by Mr Titov for improving the investment climate have broad support in the business community and government. But observers say his plan is discredited by his association with Sergei Glazyev, a presidential adviser who has floated radical ideas such as completely cutting Russia off from the dollar.""There is no way that Putin would support something like that,"" says Oleg Kouzmin, an economist at Renaissance Capital in Moscow. ""Russia's successful adaptation to lower oil prices has convinced him that orthodox macroeconomic policy works.""So far Mr Putin is keeping his options open: he had his aides present their rival plans behind closed doors on Tuesday. But Mr Kudrin and Mr Titov have been sparring publicly. Mr Kudrin mockingly wrote last week that his competitors were behaving ""like medieval alchemists [offering] to instantly turn heaps of lead into piles of gold"".Mr Titov hit back. ""Maybe somewhere, some day, when the conditions are right, the 'institutions' will improve,"" he said of Mr Kudrin's advice. ""But here and now, everyone will just keep on stealing and taking the riches abroad.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/kremlin-gathers-experts-to-tackle-russias-anaemic-growth.html

A new study shows Millennials have more experience with small business and greater desire to start businesses than previous generations. But the study also demonstrates a continuing need for help for entrepreneurs if they'll create the jobs America needs.The study, released Wednesday by America's SBDC, the association of the country's small business development centers, shows that people in their 20s and 30s are eager to launch new companies and be their own boss and that they trust themselves to provide their own financial security more than they trust others.This entrepreneurial yearning isn't idle dreaming. Even though they're younger, Millennials are already more likely to have started a business than Baby Boomers (born between 1946 and mid-60s) or Gen Xers (mid-60s to 1980).

New businesses not only produce most of the jobs but improve productivity, even create entire new industries.The America's SBDC study, conducted in late March by the Center for Generational Kinetics, found:\xe2\x96\xba Nearly a third of Millennials have already started some kind of business (30% versus 19% for Boomers and 22% of Gen Xers), 38% have been part of a startup, and a full quarter (26%) have lived entirely off the income of a small business.\xe2\x96\xba Almost half of Millennials (49%) want to start their own business in the next three years. Over half (54%) would quit their job and start a business in the next six months with the right resources.\xe2\x96\xba More than other generations, Millennials were likely to grow up in a household that owned a small business (18% versus 12% for Boomers and 15% for Gen Xers) and a third of them have family or friends who work in a small business (33% versus 22% of Boomers and 20% of Gen Xers).\xe2\x96\xba Contrary to stereotypes, Millennials are pretty down-to-earth in their outlook. They're more likely to want to start a business to make money (specifically, ""lots of money"" as the study worded it), rather than to have fun, than other generations \xe2\x80\x94 the breakdown being 66% for Millennials, 62% for Gen Xers and 53% for Boomers. Half feel that financial stability is a must before launching out on their own.\xe2\x96\xba Millennials are unaware of entrepreneurial resources. They are less likely than other generations to know where to turn for help, such as the network of SBDCs.\xe2\x96\xba Business plans are still relevant. Forty-four percent of Millennials (versus only 18% of Boomers and Gen Xers each) have written a business plan or overview for starting their own business and just over half (51%) say business plan development is the number one type of help they want (beating out tax and regulation issues).\xe2\x96\xba Millennials like urban. 61% of Millennials think urban settings are the best places to start a business versus suburban (32%).\xe2\x96\xba They're global.

172,"US shale, trade and sanctions worry Russian Finance minister as economy gets back on track",World Economy,31-05-2017,"VIDEO3:1603:16Interested in joint investments with all Western colleagues: Russia finance ministerSquawk Box EuropeAs Russia's economy show signs of improving, its Finance Ministry remains positive on the outlook yet doesn't expect to let its guard down just yet.  ""We see that the Russian economy has started to develop at a higher rate. It has come out of recession this year and we anticipate annual growth of around 2 percent,"" Anton Siluanov, finance minister for Russia, told CNBC Tuesday via a translator.  This picture however wasn't as buoyant back in 2015, when Russia was struggling to get itself out of a recession and was trying to remain steady despite a sharp decline in the oil price. Fast forward and Russia's economy grew 0.5 percent in the first quarter year-on-year, Reuters reported this month, citing data from the Federal Statistics Service.  In recent weeks however, the nation has been caught up in political noise coming out of Washington, in regards to its relationship with the current U.S. administration. Despite any negative headlines coming out from U.S.-Russia relations, the ministry remains ""interested in joint investments and partnership(s) with all our Western colleagues and partners, including with American business.""  ""We welcome any investors in Russia and we are sure that these investments in Russia, these investments from business in Russia, will let them attain good yields, strong, reliable yields. So we are interested in the development of our relations with business in any country, including of course with American business.""While Russia's economy and government finances could be heading in the right direction, Siluanov admitted that the ministry couldn't ""always feel relaxed"", even with budget revenues improving.  ""Our key task now is to prepare a new budget plan for the next three years. It will be no less important or difficult as we have to further reduce the dependence of the budget on the price of oil,"" said the minister.  While Siluanov admitted that some results had already been achieved, including balancing the budget from the expectation of oil prices being at $100 per barrel to $60, the ministry would have to continue this trend to ensure that their ""commitments were sustainable"", and not let external factors, oil or sanctions deviate from this.  ""It's no easy one and so we have to be under pressure for a few years to come to get the budget into a balanced position and not dependent on external factors.""Russia's future when it comes to sanctions, tradeSanctions continue to dwell on the country's economic and political future, after the European Union and the U.S. imposed sanctions on the nation, when it annexed Crimea from Ukraine back in 2014, and then allegedly backed separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine.  At last week's G-7 meeting, members stated in a communiqu\xc3\xa9 that sanctions could be rolled back if Russia meets its commitments in the Minsk Agreements and that the G-7 were willing to work with Russia on regional issues.VIDEO3:0503:05Exports growth has stayed at same level for Russia recently, says finance ministerSquawk Box EuropeWhether sanctions will be rolled back anytime soon, the finance ministry continues to factor in that the current regime will be maintained, when looking at their forecasts. Nevertheless, Siluanov said it was in their interest that ""any limitation on the flow of capital or trade be lifted.""  ""This would give the opportunity for higher rates of investment, higher rates in the economy and correspondingly in the replenishment of the budget.""  Sticking with trade, in recent months Russia has seen a growth in its imports, yet when it came to exports, growth had maintained its current level, Siluanov revealed.  ""Linked with this, we see a certain increase in the outflow of capital in the balance of payments. But this is due to the fact that our export companies have accumulated foreign currency earnings and are holding them in their accounts, so that is also one of the factors in the outlow of capital,"" he said adding that their balance of payments remained ""stable"" and didn't see any major risks when it came to changes in currency exchange rates.The predictability of oil pricesOil prices may not be back to the level they once were in 2013, however prices have shown a recovery as of late, as OPEC and non-OPEC members look to find ways of fixing the glut in the market. Following last week's decision by oil producers to extend output cuts by nine months to March 2018, Siluanov told CNBC that OPEC's decisions would give opportunity for prices to stay at present levels, but that both producers and the ministry had to be on alert for any market changes.VIDEO1:1901:19OPEC decision gives opportunity for oil prices to stay at present levels: Russia finance ministerSquawk Box Europe""On the one hand, this should keep prices at the levels they are at present, and on the other it gives a signal to those companies which are extracting shale oil, particularly in the USA, by increasing levels of drilling, by increasing the levels of extraction, and in the final reckoning by the growth of offers on the oil market,"" said Siluanov.  ""At the same it is necessary to be very attentive, it is necessary to be ready for the fact that the possible surplus offers of oil will put pressure to lower the price.""  ""Our task as the Ministry of Finance is to be prepared for any such changes, to create extra reserves as we have talked about, and hedge our budget from any fluctuations on external commodities markets.""  ""In our view, the most important thing is for the prices to be predictable. And this has a corresponding effect on how predictably economic agents and governments behave when budget policy is being drawn up.""

Contrary to widespread belief, China isn't the cheap place to manufacture that it once was, and rising costs have been forcing manufacturers to explore new countries to make their goods.The U.S. may not be top of mind for all industries, but some manufacturers are taking a second look at the country \xe2\x80\x94 and many of them are Chinese. Throw in the possibility of lower corporate taxes under President Donald Trump, and more will likely come looking.""The reason we want to invest in the U.S. isn't only because the Trump administration is encouraging it,"" Xiao Wunan, deputy chairman of Asia Pacific Exchange and Cooperation Foundation, who takes Chinese business executives to the U.S. on investment tours, told CNBC. ""The U.S. has natural advantages for [Chinese] investment.""Why go to the U.S.?The cost advantageJohn Ling, president of the Council of American States in China, makes a living finding prospective investment locations in the U.S. for Chinese companies.""In every project I help to land in the U.S., if I cannot present evidence that they can lower their costs, my chance of doing [the deal] in the U.S. is almost zero,"" he told CNBC. ""Cost is driving this.""American workers earn a lot of money compared to their counterparts in China, but the U.S. can still come out on top when costs are taken as a whole.For Hangzhou-based textile manufacturer Keer Group, American workers were paid on average twice as much as workers in China, according to the firm's president, Zhu Shanqing. In aggregate, however, producing in the America is significantly less compared to China.""In the U.S., land, electricity and cotton are all much cheaper,"" Zhu said. ""My production cost per ton of textiles is 25 percent lower [there].""In addition, he said, wages for him in China have been increasing 30 percent each year for much of the past decade. He has pledged $220 million to build and expand a facility in South Carolina and plans to eventually move the entire business to the U.S. where he plans to employ more than 500 people by the end of the year.Add in the possibility of a lower corporate tax to as little as 15 percent, as proposed by Trump, and the U.S. becomes a no-brainer for many manufacturers Zhu said.""If Trump cuts the corporate tax even by 5 percent, companies that left America a few years ago, will be back,"" he said.The stable business environmentCompared to many other countries, especially in the emerging world, China has been a stalwart of stability for manufacturers for decades. However, the U.S. does have some selling points that Chinese companies don't really like to talk about on record: better air, safer food, straightforward access to funding and a government that doesn't intervene.U.S. state politicians will pitch to a foreign company to bring in the jobs, but once they've invested, it's said the American officials leave them alone. Once a company is in the U.S., Chinese or not, it is treated like any other company.The proximity to the U.S. consumer Chinese consumers are the spenders of the future, but Americans are the buyers of today. As Chinese companies grow in stature and expand their footprint overseas, many of them see the U.S. market as the holy grail.Guangzhou-based GAC Motor, which is eyeing the U.S. market, says partnering with a stateside automaker or even building its own American plant one day is in the cards.""If we can succeed in the U.S. market, we can succeed anywhere in the world,"" President Yu Jun told CNBC, adding that having facilities in the U.S. makes a manufacturer more nimble to respond to a customer's needs.""No matter if it's a good economy or a bad economy, the U.S. is still the number one market for any company in the world,"" Ling explained. ""So certainly, naturally you want to be closer to where your customers are.""Flags of the U.S. and China fly along Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 17, 2011.Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWho's going, who's not?Capital-intensive industries: Definitely.All sorts of companies are interested in setting up shop in the U.S., according to Ling, but there is an emerging trend.The most suited, he said, are capital-intensive industries such as textiles, chemicals, paper and packaging and auto parts. Chinese billionaire Cao Dewang, whose company Fuyao Glass makes window shields for cars, recently invested hundreds of millions of dollars to revive a plant in Ohio.""I don't believe we have scratched the surface yet,"" Ling said.Labor-intensive industries: No thanks.Labor-intensive industries such as apparel are not as keen.China-based Austrian garment manufacturer KTC, which sells sports clothing mainly to Europe and the U.S., says its industry still depends heavily on labor. American workers are still more expensive than Chinese and the other factors wouldn't bring costs down enough to make it worthwhile for a move, says Managing Director Gerhard Flatz.Additionally, American workers don't have the skills right now that have been developed in China over years, he told CNBC.Ling said some high-labor businesses, though, have been able to make the transition lowering costs since, unlike in China, manufacturers in the U.S. don't have to worry about building dormitories and canteens or arranging transportation for their workers. ""You only have a small canteen with a refrigerator and one or two microwaves,"" Ling said about the U.S.What's stopping them from coming?A skills shortageChina's status as a manufacturing powerhouse means it has gained decades of experienced talent \xe2\x80\x94 which has been drained out of the U.S.""We face pressure in the U.S. because we cannot find skilled workers. Most of the people have not worked in this [field] before in their lives,"" Keer's Zhu said.KTC's Flatz sees a strong argument for investment in training and education for more China-based jobs to move to America. ""Education\xe2\x80\x94tradesman education,"" he said. ""You have to make sure that you have enough educational power in the States, more or less, to bring up this entire industry.""VisasTo help train American workers, some manufacturers in China want to bring in their own managers and skilled workforce, but are having trouble obtaining the proper paperwork.""Our technicians cannot get visas to go to the U.S. We need [our staff], but many of them have been refused,"" Zhu said. ""We are facing a new challenge.""Supply ChainIn addition to the lack of skilled workers, Flatz said entire supply chains would have to relocate to the U.S. for some industries.""None of us apparel manufacturers would move to the U.S. without having an ecosystem on site as we have in China,"" he said.The U.S. would have to do what the Chinese did decades ago, the China manufacturing veteran explained: set up economic zones, offer better infrastructure and financial incentives as a package.""Make it the same as the Chinese,"" he said.

The dollar recouped its losses in the previous session, rising strongly against sterling after a projection by polling company YouGov showed British Prime Minister Theresa May could lose an overall majority in parliament in a June 8 election. The projection raised the prospect of political deadlock just as formal Brexit talks begin. Also helping the dollar, U.S. consumer spending recorded its biggest increase in four months in April and monthly inflation rebounded, pointing to improving domestic demand that could allow the Fed to raise interest rates next month.AP""The market has been overenthusiastic in terms of the weakness (seen). Once the rate hike happens, people will focus on political uncertainty and on the physical support (for gold),"" said Hamza Khan, head of commodities strategy at ING. ""Fundamentally we favor the upside. We see prices at $1,350 (an ounce) for the third quarter, and $1,250 for the second quarter."" Spot gold edged up 0.75 percent at $1,272.20 per ounce after slipping earlier in the day. It closed 0.3 percent lower on Tuesday after rising to a one-month high of $1,270.47.

U.S. interest rate futures on Tuesday indicated a nearly 89 percent chance of a June rate rise, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. Higher rates would reduce the demand for non-interest bearing bullion as well as boosting the U.S. dollar, making dollar-priced gold costlier for non-U.S. investors. Political tensions in the United States and Europe continue to support gold and have prevented any major losses for the metal, said Yuichi Ikemizu, Tokyo branch manager at ICBC Standard Bank.

""The company posted a phenomenal 14.3 percent increase for the quarter, which is all the more amazing when you consider that it comes on top of a 15.2 percent gain one year ago.""The cosmetics retailer attributed its same-store sales success to three key factors: traffic to the second-tier and strip malls that host its stores, price increases, and e-commerce strength.Cramer noted that management did not mention tailwinds stemming from the ""selfie generation"" that seems to be driving cosmetics sales as various social media channels gain traction.That trifecta has pushed Ulta to make plans to add 100 stores to its 1,000-store roster to meet demand at its brick-and-mortar stores, making it an unusual player in the otherwise traffic-starved world of traditional retail.""Ulta's in a league of its own,"" Cramer said. ""Ulta's got the playbook, I just don't know if anyone else can crib from it. That's how special this story is. While the sun sets on the others, it shines on Ulta Beauty.""The Carnival Breeze in Dubrovnik, Croatia.Getty ImagesAnd when millennials are not shopping for makeup, Cramer believes they are taking part in the experiential economy, particularly one red-hot sector driving experience-based spending: the cruise lines.""Before the rise of social media, taking a cruise was kind of an old person's game,"" he said. ""But now that millennials feel the need to take selfies from cool locations all over the world, they're taking cruises like never before.""In fact, the industry is expected to spend $6.8 billion in 2017 on new ships that can handle 30,000 more passengers, an investment that is expected to continue through 2018 and 2019.""You don't spend that kind of dough unless you're feeling real confident about the future,"" Cramer said.FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google) apps on a smartphone.Adam Jeffery | CNBCThough it might look like the FANG stocks \xe2\x80\x94 Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google parent Alphabet \xe2\x80\x94 are the market's only driving forces, Cramer has found otherwise.""I'm looking at the new high list for the  today, and you know what I saw? I like what I saw, which is a broad distribution among the 70 companies that hit this august list \xe2\x80\x94 70 out of 500 making new highs,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said on Wednesday.While the rally may feel tech-driven, Cramer noticed that only 11 of the 70 companies that hit new highs were tech stocks, mostly from the semiconductor space.Of the rest, 23 were utility companies, an understandable group to be hitting new highs considering the market's worries about a slowing U.S. economy.""But that leaves 36 stocks that have nothing to do with tech or utilities rallying today, and those are where I gain solace, solace that perhaps things aren't as narrow or as unhealthy as they seem to so many,"" Cramer said.Dion Weisler, CEO, Hewlett-PackardScott Mlyn | CNBC Cramer also sat down with HP Inc. President and CEO Dion Weisler, who said that the idea for the company's blockbuster device, a mini-printer that connects to smartphones called the HP Sprocket, originally came from a conversation with an intern.It started after a presentation HP's interns deliver to company executives, when Weisler asked the 14- and 15-year-olds if they print. Three of them said they did not \xe2\x80\x94 they had no need for it.""I said, 'Well, hang on a second, what about putting a photo on your wall?'"" the CEO told Cramer on Wednesday. ""And with perfect innocence, this kid said to me, 'What, stick my phone on the wall?' And it was kind of at that point that we said, 'We've got to make print relevant. Emergency meeting, everybody. How are we going to do that?' and that's when the idea of the Sprocket came up.""Con Edison CEO: Customer-focused Means Energy EfficientFinally, Cramer spoke with John McAvoy, the chairman, president and CEO of Consolidated Edison, to find out more about the utility giant and its transition to clean energy.""We're leading the transition to a clean energy economy,"" McAvoy told Cramer on Wednesday. ""We're very customer-focused. Customers want clean energy. The communities we serve want clean energy.""And despite talk at the federal level of the Trump administration pulling the United States out of the Paris climate accord, McAvoy said customer demand is driving the move to cleaner energy.""Energy efficiency is one of the things that we are strong advocates for. We have invested $290 million since 2009 in incentive and rebates. Over 320,000 customers have taken advantage of that. In addition to new facilities and lower energy bills, we have the environmental advantage equivalent to taking 200,000 cars off the road,"" the CEO said.Lightning Round: Is Yahoo...

178,Euro zone inflation dips as 'taper' talk builds ahead of ECB meeting,Europe News,31-05-2017,"Tourists and pedestrians fill an aisle between food stalls inside Boqueria market in Barcelona, Spain.Pau Barrena | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesInflation data in the 19-member euro area dropped to 1.4 percent (year-on-year) in May, from 1.9 percent in April, according to fresh figures Wednesday from the European statistics office.The decrease was mainly influenced by energy prices. Despite being the most important component driving up inflation, energy fell to 4.6 percent from 7.6 percent in April. Nonetheless for the past few readings, headline inflation has been nearing close to, but still below, the 2 percent target of the European Central Bank (ECB).The continuous surge in inflation and positive economic data across the bloc keep adding pressure on the ECB to start reducing its monetary stimulus.Tapering talks could start next weekFour unnamed ECB officials told Reuters on Tuesday that the central bank is getting ready to soften its stance on monetary easing next week at a Governing Council meeting.The meeting on June 8 is the first since the outcome of the French election and will provide an economic update to members. The reduced political uncertainty in the euro zone coupled with stronger inflation and solid economic figures could kick off the discussion on how and when the central bank should ""taper"".""In the grand scheme of things, this report merely shows that euro zone inflation pressures returned to 'trend' in May following an unsustainable jump in April,"" Claus Vistesen, chief euro zone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in an email.""Draghi likely will reiterate that the ECB sees no 'sustained upturn in underlying inflation' when the ECB meets next month. Core inflation is a long-lagging indicator in the euro zone, though, and we think it will move higher soon,"" he added. Next week's potential talk on ""tapering"" should therefore be a brief one. The surge in inflation has been mainly driven by energy prices and the ECB is more generally concerned that it is not on a sufficient enough path of sustainability. ECB President Mario Draghi told lawmakers on Monday that despite the positive trend across the bloc, overall extraordinary policy needs to stay.""We remain firmly convinced that an extraordinary amount of monetary policy support, including through our forward guidance, is still necessary for the present level of underutilized resources to be re-absorbed and for inflation to return to and durably stabilize around levels close to 2 percent within a meaningful medium-term horizon,"" Draghi said.Removal of 'downside risks'?Achilleas Chrysostomou, economist at Standard Chartered, said in a research note on Wednesday, that the European Central Bank is ""to begin preparing the market for the end of its quantitative easing program by removing the reference to 'downside risks' to growth at its 8 June meeting."" He added that he sees the ECB tapering next year but the first rate hikes should not take place before 2019.""Comparing the ECB's balance sheet to the Fed's, significant divergence seems set to continue in the next 12 months,"" Chrysostomou said.""We expect the ECB to continue net asset purchases until around the third quarter of 2018, while the Fed will likely begin reducing its stock of quantitative easing assets early in 2018 \xe2\x80\xa6These opposite moves mean that the ECB's balance sheet could be around 20 percent larger than the Fed's by around end-2018, assuming constant FX rates,"" he noted.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

And TBS recently wrapped up a two-month televised eSports tournament centering around the game, with a prize pool of $250,000.Meet the 2017 CNBC Disruptor 50 companiesSkillz founder and CEO Andrew Paradise says he thinks this is the beginning of a larger movement in the video game industry.""[Big game publishers] haven't been building [eSports] content for mobile devices,"" he says. ""This is a pivotal moment in the industry, where one of the biggest competitive games is being built for mobile.""Beeline and Skillz have not yet announced when the mobile, competitive version of ""Street Fighter"" will go live for players and spectators.The partnership is a notable departure for Skillz. Historically, the company has largely focused on casual gamers, with its top draw being a bubble-popping game called ""Bubble Shooter."" That focus has attracted more than 12 million players from 180 countries.This is a pivotal moment in the industry, where one of the biggest competitive games is being built for mobile.Andrew Paradisefounder and CEO of SkillzWhile there are some titles Skillz offers that might appeal to hardcore, or enthusiast, players, they're all made by independent developers and don't have widespread name recognition. Paradise says he believes the entry of ""Street Fighter"" into the mobile eSports market will lead to others joining. (In fact, he says, Skillz has other deals that will be announced in the weeks and months to come.)""We're going to see more of that 'traditional' hardcore gaming experience,"" he says. ""More and more studios will be doing that with Skillz in the future.""Why Skillz and why mobile? It could come down to hardware. About 4.3 billion people currently have mobile broadband subscriptions, according to the most recent Ericsson Mobility Report. That's notably higher than the total number of computers, the preferred system of professional competitive gamers.""For the last five years, we've been building out a fully featured eSports [platform],"" says Paradise. ""Mobile eSports will push eSports into the mainstream much faster than what's happened with computers.""Meteoric riseSkillz, meanwhile, has quietly become one of the biggest eSports companies, awarding $50 million to players in 2016 and raising $28 million from venture firms, including Sequoia Capital and The Kraft Group, founded by Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots.The push to attract the core gamer demographic is about more than boosting annual revenues and the total number of users. It's also a drive to widen the larger playing field for eSports, says Paradise.More from CNBC Disruptor 50:How a prodigy built a billion-dollar empire from age 14 This new mobile app may destroy your privacy A start-up disrupting Facebook, Google and AmazonAt present, there's really no chance for the average fan to earn any cash playing a competitive game of ""Street Fighter.""

So rather than having to play in the gaming equivalent of the NBA, fans of a title could also compete on a college basketball level or even a recreational league.

But these casinos are facing difficulties attracting Chinese gamblers, and have even more issues than their Macau counterparts when it comes to recovering their debts.How many mainlanders go to Singapore to gamble?Last year, tourist arrivals and spending in the city state hit record highs, buoyed by the arrival of mainland Chinese visitors. Over 2.86 million stopped in Singapore in 2016, a 36 per cent increase on the previous year. That's still small fry compared to Macau, which sees about 20 million mainland gamblers each year.How is Singapore targeting mainlanders who are keen to gamble?Singapore legalised casino gambling a decade ago, but its two resorts have been struggling in recent years to attract mainland tourists. The casinos have been hit hard by Beijing's corruption crackdown and rival casinos popping up around Asia. The city state's strict gambling rules have also deterred mainland visitors.VIDEO1:3201:32Macau's casino industry turns the cornerStreet Signs AsiaBeijing's crackdown on capital flight is also expected to cast an impact on the gambling business in the Lion City.Singapore's two gambling resorts, the Marina Bay Sands \xe2\x80\x93 owned by the Las Vegas Sands Corporation \xe2\x80\x93 and locally-owned Resorts World Sentosa have both seen revenue decline, and have tried to get visitors to spend on non-gambling activities. At the lavish Marina Bay Sands, for instance, there's a 57-storey high, 150-metre rooftop infinity pool and an art museum.The Singapore Tourism Board has also been intensifying marketing efforts in tier-one and two cities in China by partnering with the country's digital players like Tuniu and curating content on Singapore's tourist attractions for Chinese platforms, including WeChat and Dianping.Why do Singapore's casinos have a problem recovering their debts?Singapore casinos have more trouble getting gamblers to pay up than their Macau counterparts. In Macau, about 200 licensed junket operators provide credit to casino customers and collect the money they owe. But in Singapore, there are only three licensed operators, so gaming losses tend to fall on the casinos, who are then forced to use legal means to get their money back. According to Bloomberg figures, the number of lawsuits against gamblers who didn't cough up the cash grew from two in 2013 to 49 in 2014.VIDEO3:1003:10Why Wynn Casinos chairman is investing big Squawk Box AsiaBut the problems don't stop there for Singapore's casinos. The city doesn't have a reciprocal enforcement of judgements with China, except for Hong Kong.

Asked on Twitter what he would do if Trump pulled out of the landmark global deal to curb emissions, Musk said he would ""have no choice but to depart [the] councils in that case."" Musk tweet: Will have no choice but to depart councils in that caseTrump tweeted Wednesday that he will announce his decision on the Paris deal ""over the next few days"" as he faces intense pressure from the deal's supporters and detractors. Reports Wednesday indicated that he is expected to withdraw from the climate agreement, though some news outlets cautioned that he had not made a final decision.Musk, who also founded SpaceX, is on Trump's manufacturing jobs council, his strategic and policy forum, and his infrastructure council. Musk has defended his role advising Trump in the face of some criticism from anti-Trump activists, arguing that they should want his voice in the discussions to offer views that differ from those of the president's other advisors. Musk, among other CEOs of major American companies, urged Trump to uphold the agreement. He tweeted Wednesday that he has ""done all [he] can to advise directly to [Trump],"" through White House officials and advisory councils, to remain in the accord. Since taking office, Trump has started to roll back Obama administration energy regulations that he and some advisors say hold back American energy companies. While officials like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson support the Paris deal, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt had pushed against it. A group of top Republican senators including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also urged Trump to withdraw from the agreement. The White House did not immediately respond to a request to comment on this article.

""I have got to get rid of the things that keep readers from being able to understand us and relate to us, and hold on to things that protect the mission,"" Baquet said during a panel at Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, CA, on Tuesday.It may mean a story is told in tweets instead of a traditionally written article, Baquet explained. He pointed to terrorism reporter Rukmini Callimachi tweeting her thoughts on a speech given by former President Barack Obama as a faster, more efficient way to get a story out.""People like Rukmini are inventing a new kind of journalistic writing,"" Baquet explained. ""I think it's easier to reach people. It's certainly journalistic, and it's certainly timely. It follows all the rules, and it's not opinion.""As local papers shrink staffs, it's more important to spread the scope of the New York Times, Baquet said. It includes allowing more people to read the paper despite the paywall, and moving more reporters to other parts of the country. ""Most of the press misunderstood the anger and anti-elitism that drove Donald Trump to power,"" he said.It also means Baquet is open to accepting money from for-profit organizations in order to fund reporting, as long as the reason is not political. For example, the New York Times is working with the New Orleans Times-Picayune on several environment-themed features, paid for by an unnamed company Baquet insists had no hidden agenda besides wanting more stories on the subject.He also defended the hire of Bret Stephens, a conservative journalist who is known for his anti-climate change views. Baquet said Stephens doesn't deny climate change is happening, but believes people have become too fanatical about climate change as if it were a religion. It's important to point out contrarian views to the New York Times readership, he said.""The left as a rule doesn't want to hear thoughtful disagreement,"" he pointed out.And, reporters have to look at new sources for stories. The entire Washington bureau of 50 to 60 journalists are on notice to cover President Donald Trump's tweets.""He's the President of the United States,"" Baquet said.

Microsoft has tried Qualcomm chips with lighter versions of its OS such as Windows RT, but those efforts failed because the computers couldn't run most apps designed for Windows. That's what changes now.Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 processor, typically reserved for smartphones such as the Samsung Galaxy S8, will power the new Windows 10 computers and will offer constant connectivity.That means folks who buy a new computer from Asus, HP or Lenovo should expect it to come with the option to add it to their wireless carrier for data service when Wi-Fi isn't available.Qualcomm said the new computers will be ""lighter and more portable than any other laptop currently available,"" while also offering longer battery life than current solutions on the market.It sounds appealing, but here's why Intel shouldn't worry.While the Snapdragon 835 is a powerful-enough chip for smartphones, you shouldn't expect these computers to offer robust support for rendering in Photoshop or video editing, even though Qualcomm promises support for ""all Windows applications.""

192,"Oil prices crushed as traders bet against OPEC, Russia in 'game of chicken'",Market Insider,31-05-2017,"VIDEO2:1702:17Here's why oil prices collapsed after OPEC meeting: John KilduffSquawk BoxThe oil market has serious doubts that the production deal between OPEC and Russia is sufficient enough to bring the world oil market back into balance, against a potential wave of new supply.As a result, traders appeared to be adding to short positions, as crude fell sharply Wednesday morning, analysts said. The decline in oil prices was triggered by news that Libya had increased its production to a three-year high of 827,000 barrels a day.""The game of chicken between them and the market is back on again,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital.West Texas Intermediate crude for July settled off 2.7 percent, at $48.32 per barrel after briefly breaking $48. Brent, the international benchmark, dipped temporarily below the psychological $50 for the first time in two weeks, and was down 3 percent at $50.66 in afternoon trading.Last week, Saudi Arabia and other members of OPEC agreed with Russia and other producers to extend their agreement to cut back output by 1.8 million barrels a day for another nine months. But market expectations had been hinging on the idea that producers would take even more barrels off the market because of the overhang of supply. Oil plunged 5 percent last Thursday, after the announcement.VIDEO3:3903:39Here's why oil is headed to $40: Technical analystFast Money""The meeting was much more of a failure than people realize because of what wasn't achieved. There are no caps on production for Libya, or Nigeria, or Iran,"" said Kilduff. Libya has shipped an average of 500,000 barrels per day of oil so far this year, up from 300,000 per day last year. Production reached 800,000 barrels per day earlier this month.""There were official statements about production from the Libyan National Oil Co., and that validated it with the market,"" Kilduff said. Saudi Arabia and Russia said Wednesday that the cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producers would extend beyond March, when the deal ends. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih was quoted as saying the producers want to ""institutionalize cooperation.""Even the biggest producers need a higher oil price to meet their budget demands. Russia's stock market was under pressure as crude prices fell, losing 2.3 percent and the ruble was down a half percent against the dollar.  Kilduff and other analysts said some speculative commodities traders cleared out shorts ahead of OPEC's meeting last week, where the production deal was extended. Last week's CFTC data of traders' positions show a reduction of 91,700 short positions in futures contracts to 278,200, just ahead of Thursday's meeting. Each futures contract equals 1,000 barrels, meaning the short position was reduced by 91.7 million barrels. ""They covered just before the meeting and that enabled them to have the dry powder to go in and attack once this news came out,"" said Kilduff.Nigeria and Libya have been wild cards in the world oil market, since their ability to return production to the market on a consistent basis has been in doubt. But U.S. producers have also been a problem for the OPEC deal, since shale producers, benefiting from ever-improving technology have been able to increase output, already back to 2015 levels.The U.S., now at about 9.3 million barrels a day, could see a return to record levels of production by year-end unless prices fall dramatically.VIDEO4:2304:23Tom Lee on oil\xe2\x80\x99s hidden driversTrading NationOPEC has said the global market is showing signs of rebalancing, but U.S. inventories are staying persistently high. Weekly U.S. government data are the most accessible to the market. The data from last week are expected to show a drawdown of 3.2 million barrels when released Thursday morning, according to Platt's. Gasoline stocks are expected to decline by 1 million barrels and diesel and other distillates are projected to drop by 300,000 barrels.""The key issue is it hasn't really been able to manifest. If you believe what Saudi Arabia said, they're going to try to target the inventories in the U.S., and there will probably be steeper declines because they're going to limit their exports,"" said Bart Melek, global head of commodities strategy at TD Securities.""There are really mounting concerns about the excess supply in the world and the ability of the agreement to whittle that down,"" said Gene McGillian, manager market research at Tradition Energy. ""We're getting Libya, Nigeria and the North Sea poking their heads up. Are the bears really going to be convinced as we approach the $45 area that they were going to be in a position to see global inventories going down?"" said McGillian.

I like what I saw, which is a broad distribution among the 70 companies that hit this august list \xe2\x80\x94 70 out of 500 making new highs,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said on Wednesday.While the rally may feel tech-driven, Cramer noticed that only 11 of the 70 companies that hit new highs were tech stocks, mostly from the semiconductor space.Of the rest, 23 were utility companies, an understandable group to be hitting new highs considering the market's worries about a slowing U.S. economy.Watch the full segment here:VIDEO11:5011:50Cramer takes to the new high list to prove the rally is wider than it seemsMad Money with Jim Cramer""But that leaves 36 stocks that have nothing to do with tech or utilities rallying today, and those are where I gain solace, solace that perhaps things aren't as narrow or as unhealthy as they seem to so many,"" Cramer said.First, he turned to 3M, an industrial conglomerate that has consistently delivered strong results for shareholders.""I've often called 3M what I call 'a core holding,' meaning it's a stock you never want to sell if you can avoid it,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""3M is exactly the kind of stock you want on the new high list if you're concerned about a rally being too narrow.""Boeing, the largest aerospace company in the world, also hit a new high. Cramer pointed out that as one of the United States' biggest exporters, Boeing would not be able to sell its products if the economy was dramatically slowing.Cramer also noticed that railroad operator CSX was on the list, which would also not be outperforming if the cargo industry was on the verge of collapse.Even with the appointment of new CEO Hunter Harrison, which gave the stock a boost, Cramer takes CSX's success as a sign of strength in commerce.Consumer strength was illuminated by Carnival Corporation's place on the list. Cramer called the cruise line ""the ultimate in discretionary spending,"" meaning that customers do not need to spend on cruises, but since they are, the consumer cannot be as weak as some may think.""And then there's the clinchers, frankly: McDonald's, Yum [Brands] and Starbucks. These are three classic growth names that have all the same concerns: labor costs going up, strong dollar liabilities, higher price-to-earnings multiples than we might otherwise expect. But they're all hitting the new high list nonetheless,"" Cramer said.Some sectors makes the ""Mad Money"" host uneasy. One is the downtrodden bank stocks, which have been lower on negative effects of trading, and the oil stocks.""The oils? If you own 'em, it's deathly,"" he said. ""The fact is, there's too much oil. On the other hand, though, I think the group has already gotten pretty cheap. The oils represent value here and that's not a sin.""And while retail has been a consistent, market-wide concern, Cramer said that Wal-Mart and Costco's successes are at least challenging Amazon's domination.""Sure, it's easy to point endlessly to the coming FANG apocalypse,"" Cramer said. ""I just want to point out that when you look at the new high list, it's about as broad as you could ask, sans the utilities and their safe dividends.

Not even Merriam-Webster can explain Donald Trump's tweet Portland train stabbing victim: 'I'm just trying to heal and recover'Except you are not. You are now entering the realm of thirdhand smoke.Have you ever been in a hotel where the only rooms remaining are on a smoking floor? Doesn't smell too good? That's where thirdhand smoke lives. In the drapes. In the carpet. In the bedspread. In the ceiling tiles.And, according to researchers, it can do you \xe2\x80\x93 and, more particularly, young children \xe2\x80\x93 harm. A study by scientists at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that newborn mice that lived in cages containing smoke-treated fabric for three weeks weighed significantly less than their counterparts in a control group. In addition, both newborn and adult mice exposed to thirdhand smoke experienced changes in blood cell counts associated with the immune system, leading to inflammatory and allergic reactions.The research team believes the results of the mice experiment can apply to humans, too.""We suspected that the young are most vulnerable because of their immature immune systems, but we didn't have a lot of hard evidence to show that before,"" said study lead author Bo Hang, a Berkeley Lab staff scientist who previously found that thirdhand smoke could lead to genetic mutations in human cells. ""In this case, we found that thirdhand smoke appeared to inhibit weight gain in neonatal mice.""In a paper published in the journal  Scientific Reports, Hang's team noted that human babies and toddlers are at greater risk because they come into contact with contaminated surfaces while crawling on carpets and sleeping on smoke-infused bedding.""Those are all types of white blood cells associated with inflammation and allergic reactions,"" said Jian-Hua Mao, another member of the team, which is based at the University of California-Berkeley.

""When residual nicotine reacts to certain chemicals in the air it forms cancer-causing agents that continue to develop over time,"" says an RHA  paper. ""Also, when nicotine reacts with ozone in the air it forms 'ultrafine' particles, which can transport harmful chemicals.""So how do you reduce the risks?

202,"Suppliers fall if Apple has bad news, but this one could overcome a drastic iPhone slowdown",Tech,30-05-2017,"Taiwanese manufacturer Hon Hai Precision Industry earns a notable chunk of revenue from assembling iPhones, leaving it exposed to swings in demand for Apple smartphones.But the company's ability to do high volume, value-added manufacturing at a reasonable cost may cushion it from any potential slowdown in demand for iPhones in the long term, a JPMorgan analyst told CNBC.  It is expected to assemble the bulk of Apple's newest smartphones due later this year, and may benefit from a supercycle.  ""Hon Hai, at the end of the day, is a process company,"" said Gokul Hariharan, Asia tech analyst and head of Taiwan equity research at JPMorgan. ""If you look at the history of Hon Hai over the last 20 years, product cycle has not really mattered as much.""Sean Gallup | Getty ImagesHe explained the company has always tried to run a vertically integrated business model, where it started with connectors and other components business before going into assembly in mid-to-late 90s.First Hon Hai assembled desktops when they were still the main tech product; then it moved into game consoles, feature phones with Motorola and Nokia, and music players for Apple before moving onto smartphones.  ""So all along, the skill set they're providing is high volume manufacturing at a very reasonable cost and very strong execution,"" Hariharan said, adding the manufacturer also brings in a fair bit of technology elements into its offering.  ""Which is why it feels like it may not be very directly linked to product cycles in the long term.""  Along the way, Hon Hai added some components businesses to their operations in an attempt to maximize the value, in terms of dollar content, within any product they assemble, according to Hariharan.Last year's acquisition of troubled Japanese electronics maker Sharp meant Hon Hai now had access to two major components of a smartphone: camera modules and display. These two functionalities are usually expected to be upgraded by smartphone vendors, even when other features of handsets may remain the same.  ""If you look at most tech products, display is typically one of the largest cost items in terms of components,"" Hariharan said.  Japanese business daily Nikkei reported in January that Hon Hai and Sharp were mulling over building a factory in China \xe2\x80\x94 where the iPhones are assembled \xe2\x80\x94 to make OLED display panels.The proximity could theoretically reduce components cost for making the iPhone. The next generation of iPhones are expected to come with OLED display and currently Samsung Display will provide the bulk of these panels for Apple.VIDEO1:4901:49Cramer: iPhone 8 cycle will be a big oneSquawk on the StreetReuters reported that Hon Hai and Sharp have teamed up to bid for Toshiba's prized memory chip business. Hariharan said a potential move into the semiconductor business was underpinned by the fact that Hon Hai made close to 20 to 25 percent in revenue from enterprise and cloud; the company assembles servers, storage elements and switches for tech companies and enterprise is a big driver for NAND flash, he added.  The other two major contract electronics manufacturers that assemble iPhones \xe2\x80\x94 Pegatron and Wistron \xe2\x80\x94 also remain exposed to Apple, at least in the short term. Wistron is a latecomer to the assembly equation and handles mostly the older iPhones.Hariharan said JPMorgan has a conservative view on Wistron because the company is still making the transition from producing lower-end handsets to the most advanced; it needs to build up capacity to handle the high volume seen in the first quarter of new iPhone launches, where Apple can sell more than 10 million units on the opening weekend.  ""If you're not a vendor who is able to support that volume ramp in that period, then you never get peak volume for your capacity,"" he said.  Meanwhile, some of Apple's more specialized suppliers \xe2\x80\x94 who provide components such as camera modules \xe2\x80\x94 remain well-hedged in their business because they serve the global smartphone market \xe2\x80\x94 meaning, they were also selling into other smartphone brands.For example Samsung or SK Hynix supply memory to majority of the smartphone brands. ""They don't have the same level of cyclicality,"" said Hariharan, but they don't enjoy the same benefits from a surge in demand for iPhones.

204,"China is rapidly closing the innovation gap, European firms say",Asia-Pacific News,30-05-2017,"VIDEO7:4307:43The biggest issues European businesses face in ChinaSquawk Box AsiaForget the ""copycat China"" stereotype: The world's second-largest economy is quickly shedding that image as domestic firms innovate rapidly.By 2020, 60 percent of European companies in China expect Chinese firms to have closed the innovation gap, according to the EU Chamber of Commerce in China's annual business confidence survey.""This should serve as a wake-up call for European companies,"" the report said. ""While this catching up is most likely to occur in services, with breakthroughs in industrial goods taking longer, European business needs to plan accordingly.""A clerk of ICBC bank counts Chinese 100 yuan at its branch in Beijing.Kim Kyung-Hoon | ReutersChina's rapid innovation is the latest headwind for foreign firms doing business in the country. International companies have long complained about the difficulties of operating within Chinese borders, given a murky regulatory environment, and perceived favorable treatment for domestic firms. But the prospect of finding growth in the world's second-largest economy is too great to ignore for many companies.The EU Chamber's latest findings again underscore those same issues, with half of its member firms saying that conducting business in China became more difficult in 2016. Within that, more than 70 percent in hospitality and civil engineering and construction say doing business has grown more difficult, while in aerospace and aviation, the majority say things have stayed roughly the same.""Respondents' doubts over whether China is truly committed to creating a simpler administrative environment and ensuring a level playing field continue to deepen,"" said the report. ""Cumbersome regulations and vaguely-worded laws \xe2\x80\x94 often subject to arbitrary interpretation \xe2\x80\x94 continue to pose a range of challenges.""There is also still a bilateral trade and investment gap between the EU and China given the challenging regulatory environment and barriers to entry, the report finds. Chinese investment into Europe jumped 77 percent to 35 billion euros in 2016 compared to the prior year, but investment in the other direction fell 23 percent to 8 billion euros.Although more than half of the companies surveyed clocked higher sales in 2016 compared to the year prior, it was largely attributed to large-scale financial stimulus that the Chinese government had unleashed in the first half of the year.That means the bounce is not here to stay, and as such, the top concern for European firms in China remains the health of the economy \xe2\x80\x94 especially as the country's debt levels have continued to rise.""How sustainable is the growth model? Isn't it time for China to go from talk to action?"" said Mats Harborn, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, in an interview with CNBC. ""We would want to see China go to more organically driven growth.""Following that is an ""ongoing struggle to find and retain qualified employees, a problem aggravated by demands for higher compensation among local hires."" The main challenge in attracting and keeping foreign employees is the issue of air pollution and an unwillingness to live in China.Harborn said his organization was making proposals that China ""deepen and speed up reform,"" which ""should be beneficial also for the Chinese economy.""The study had 570 respondents from a wide range of sectors, with 35 percent in professional services, 35 percent in industrial goods and services, 18 percent in consumer goods and services and the remaining 12 percent in other sectors.

A big voice hidden in the victory for Exxon Mobil shareholders, according to one report, was the votes of the world's largest asset managers and ETF companies.The Washington Post reported that BlackRock, State Street Global Advisors and Vanguard Group all voted against Exxon Mobil management and required that the company report on climate change. While BlackRock and SSGA have been vocal in recent years about shareholder activism on social issues like climate change, Vanguard has been a laggard, according to several experts who monitor shareholder votes from institutional investors. The Post's source said BlackRock definitely voted against Exxon Mobil management, and SSGA and Vanguard had ""likely"" done the same.VIDEO3:4203:42Trump reportedly to pull out of the Paris climate dealSquawk on the StreetShareholder activists have been expecting Vanguard to break from its longstanding position of rarely challenging management. It's come under attack for its voting alongside management over issues from executive pay to climate change, and recently was challenged by New York Times muckraking columnist Gretchen Morgenson about its role as a shareholder in activist-targeted Arconic.A Vanguard spokeswoman said, ""We're not discussing the Exxon vote, and the annual publication of our votes is the only time we disclose, so we'll do so later this summer.""BlackRock \xe2\x80\x94 which for the first time voted against oil and gas company management, Occidental Petroleum, over a climate change proposal earlier this year \xe2\x80\x94 said it is not making any official statement yet about the Exxon Mobil vote.SSGA said it does not discuss individual companies or votes.Before the Exxon Mobil vote was in, Heidi Welsh \xe2\x80\x94 who tracks the shareholder voting of institutions for Sustainable Investments Institute \xe2\x80\x94 cited the fact that as of June 2016, Vanguard itself reported that it voted with management 92 percent of the time, and she said, ""This looks likely to increase.""In June 2016, Vanguard released a new set of guidelines that would influence its role as a shareholder voting on annual proxies of the companies it holds in its portfolios \xe2\x80\x94 Vanguard manages more than $4 trillion in assets. Vanguard historically has not supported climate change.Mary Beth GallagherTri-State Coalition for Responsible InvestmentThe role of Vanguard as a shareholder across all of the market's major companies has been brought into greater focus as index funds take in almost all of investor flows: Vanguard took in more than $300 billion last year, while the rest of the mutual fund industry combined had negative flows. And Vanguard has been feeling a little pressure from an influential source \xe2\x80\x94 its founder Jack Bogle. At the recent Morningstar conference, Bogle was asked about the company's responsibility with ESG (environmental, social and governance) decisions as one of the world's largest shareholders. Bogle said, ""I have felt for long time people laughed at first and they are not laughing anymore. Index funds and managers are the key to strong corporate governance.""Bogle said index funds specifically lack the option active managers can take \xe2\x80\x94 to walk away from a stock where they disagree with management. ""The index manager can't sell the stock, what can he do? Improve the management,"" Bogle said. ""Index funds, including Vanguard, right now are asking for a lot more information,"" the Vanguard founder said.More from Global Investing Hot Spots: A global boom that's come from housing crisis poster-child Iceland Shell CEO on climate change and the Trump EPA position Oil industry is headed for another crisis if things don't changeJon Hale, director of sustainability research at Morningstar Research Services, said, ""It is your only recourse when you have the amount of assets they do. It's a risk to their portfolios. ... It is a big thing to make sure companies forced to own these stocks, because they own the market, are assessing climate risk."" He added that BlackRock and SSGA have historically been much more at the forefront of engaging management, relative to Vanguard.""Vanguard historically has not supported climate change,"" said Mary Beth Gallagher of the Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment in an interview with CNBC before the Exxon Mobil vote.In 2016, Vanguard voted with Exxon Mobil management and against a similar climate change measure.""Vanguard has started to come around to the point of view ... of the two other largest passive managers who have explicitly said things about emphasizing corporate engagement efforts,"" Hale said. ""It's getting to be a bit of a sea change; there was very little attention paid to the way mutual funds vote proxies, and the whole greater interest in ESG is potentially changing that,"" Hale said. ""As they own increasingly large amounts of these companies, as shareholders it is their duty.""The Morningstar SRI expert said Vanguard may have a more difficult time with this issue than BlackRock and SSGA because it is more U.S.-centric across its investors than global, and represents the largest percentage of buy-and-hold individual investors. ""One concern for Vanguard is that the U.S. is the only place in the world where investors are climate change deniers. So it is a tough issue for them to navigate; they can alienate investors, too, by making a big deal,"" he said. A Pew Research Center survey from last year found that some 55 percent of liberal Democrats say climate research reflects the best available evidence most of the time. By contrast, 9 percent of conservative Republicans say this occurs most of the time. But more than three-quarters of Democrats and most Republicans (69 percent among moderate or liberal Republicans and 48 percent of conservative Republicans) say climate scientists should have a major role in policy decisions related to the climate.Bogle gave a more simple and economic reason for moving with caution as a social activist, telling attendees at the Morningstar conference, ""Companies have to be able to make a profit."" In its last update on its role as a shareholder in proxy votes in June 2016, Vanguard reported that energy companies represented 11 percent of its engagement efforts, ranking fifth behind consumer stocks, financials, health care and technology-sector stocks. It also noted that the lowest percent of its engagement efforts occur with companies above $50 billion in market capitalization. Exxon Mobil's market cap is $339 billion.But the index giant did offer an example of what it called ""deepening discussions on climate change risks,"" citing engagement with a large oil and gas company to discuss shareholder proposals on environmental issues to understand how the company assesses and manages some of its greatest risks, particularly those related to climate change.""After analyzing the issues underlying the proposal, we have encouraged company management to make specific improvements in how it assesses the severity of these risks, communicates to shareholders about the risks, and works with key stakeholder groups to improve its practices,"" Vanguard said last June.Welsh at the Sustainable Investments Institute said after the Exxon Mobil vote she couldn't independently confirm Vanguard's decision, but she noted that last week there also were two votes on board diversity that were 80 percent-plus.According to Reuters, the Exxon Mobil climate change reporting requirement received support from 62.3 percent of shareholders, up from 38 percent last year.""Votes like that don't happen without the big mutual funds, which clearly have signaled they want action on both climate change disclosure that they see as a material risk as well as board diversity. This is pushback against the idea that shareholder resolutions only raise frivolous issues that investors don't care about.""Watch: Vanguard CEO on the issue of costVIDEO4:2804:28Vanguard CEO: Cost really matters to the end investorPower Lunch",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/index-giant-vanguard-does-about-face-on-big-investing-position-report.html
207,The new generation of employees would take less pay for these job perks,Iconic Tour,30-05-2017,"Millennials work for the cash and good health insurance \xe2\x80\x94 just like everybody else. More than half of millennials (53 percent) say compensation is more important to a job offer than corporate mission (34 percent). And 91 percent of millennials say they are most attracted to a new job by salary and benefits. But there are some job perks that will make millennials consider working for less, by as much as 12 percent. Forget about free snacks.The country's largest workforce by demographics, millennials are willing to give up a percentage of their salary for long-term job security, flexible office hours and a management structure that emphasizes mentorship and a better career trajectory, according to new research from survey software firm Qualtrics and venture capital firm Accel Partners (a Qualtrics investor). According to the survey, 77 percent of millennials would be willing to take a salary cut of at least 3 percent in exchange for long-term job security. Roughly 76 percent of millennials would take a pay cut of at least 3 percent to work for a company that offers flexible office hours, and 67 percent would be willing to take a pay cut of at least 3 percent to work at a company that offers good mentorship opportunities.

Roughly 80 percent of millennials surveyed by Qualtrics said that health-care coverage is the most important benefit, while in-office perks, like games and sports opportunities, are the least important.""We asked millennials about free food and providing a phone \xe2\x80\x94 all those things \xe2\x80\x94 but when we asked them, 'What do they care most about in a culture,' they care about the big things,"" said Mike Maughan, head of brand growth and global insights at Qualtrics.On the flip side, 65 percent of millennials said it would take a salary increase of 20 percent or greater for them to consider switching jobs.Jon Salas, 28, recently took a big pay cut to leave the ""cardboard dry culture"" at a multinational human resources consulting firm where he felt isolated from bosses and colleagues. He accepted a job at a small public relations agency, where he could be heard by, and learn from, managers and different teams on a daily basis.Jon Salas, standing, left a higher-paying job at a multinational HR company with a \xe2\x80\x98cardboard dry culture\xe2\x80\x99 to join Hollywood PR, where weekly brainstorming sessions bring the small team together.Source: Hollywood PR""There wasn't much opportunity for growth [at the previous employer]. The only way to go up was if someone left a position, and even then, you weren't guaranteed the position,"" said Salas, who now works as an assistant account executive at Hollywood PR in Boston, where the entire firm comes together every other week for strategy brainstorming sessions. Salas decided to take a $10,000 pay cut to go ""where growth opportunities are available and attainable, and where the line of work fits into my overall long-term plans,"" he said. According to Qualtrics, 80 percent of millennials say a culture that emphasizes personal growth is highly important. That means finding a place where learning is a long-term philosophy and comes from peers as well.Career growth and a collaborative work culture is also what compelled Jessica Grybek, 29, to opt for a job from a smaller, lesser-known firm that also offered less money \xe2\x80\x94 twice.""Even though my new job came with less money and a 5 a.m. start time, it was the best decision I have ever made,"" said Grybek, talking about her second job at a nationally syndicated TV show a few years back. ""The vibe was much more laid back, and there was a strong emphasis on teamwork. We were all there together to accomplish the same goal, and everyone pitched in and did what it took to make it happen."" A couple years later, when Grybek found herself choosing between a lesser-paying job with a web start-up and a marketing position with a large real estate agency, she went for the former because it ""had a better company culture and more potential for advancement,"" she said. ""I've found that it doesn't necessarily matter what you do for a living if you're working with a great team."" Today, Grybek is a marketing and public relations coordinator with the Habitat for Humanity of Collier County in Naples, Florida, a job where ""there's more of an emphasis on productivity versus sticking to a set schedule each day,"" she said.Habitat for Humanity is well known for a mission that benefits communities, and that played a role in Grybek's applying for the job, but ""mission was not necessarily the No. 1 or No. 2 item on my list in a job hunt,"" Grybek said. She said the value of the mission became much more clear once on the job.Jessica Grybek, a marketing and PR executive at Habitat for Humanity, interviewing a homeowner who had just paid off her mortgage.Source: Derek Perry, Habitat for Humanity  ""I guess I kind of stumbled into something great without being completely aware of it.

You get to see people go from living in what can be a really deplorable situation and struggling to make ends meet, to having this sense of pride and stability that they never had before. There's nothing like it.""Larry Yu, marketing partner at Accel Partners, said millennials are unique in that they highly value a transparent, collaborative culture. ""Companies like Facebook, with their open workspace and regular CEO Q&As, are clearly standard-bearers when it comes to creating a company culture that keeps millennials happy,"" he said.I have worked at two start-ups: One had free lunches and free snacks, and for me the novelty died very quickly. ...\xc2\xa0[Those perks] didn't matter; my ideas weren't being heard.Sahab Aslam, 31who recently joined Prudential's Life Technology Experimental Lab after finishing graduate school in computer science and engineeringDisdain for a rigid daily and weekly work schedule underscores what should be another selling point of companies looking to attract young talent: flexible work hours.

The beauty of the job, she says, is that she gets to set her own schedule. ""I have two children and if have to go and do something, it's very open here [so I can go and do] what I need to do,"" she said.More from iCONIC: 90% of millennials will stay in a job for 10 years if two needs are met What millennials want more than anything when they start a job Making six figures working for virtual companiesGiven that millennials came of age alongside Facebook and other prominent social media networks, and are prone to share many details of their lives online, there is definitely a plus to highlighting anything, no matter how small, that may set a workplace apart. ""Millennials are used to sharing everything on social media, and they want to share their job there as well,"" Maughan said. ""And while the key aspects of a culture can't be overlooked, they're easily overlooked if you're talking about the Facebook 15 \xe2\x80\x94 it's very easy to talk about the things that are sexy and noticeable.""It's just that having lots to brag about on Facebook \xe2\x80\x94 about what their workplace looks like or offers \xe2\x80\x94 won't likely tip the scales in an employer's favor if the fundamental wants of millennials aren't met.

It usually requires that you save and invest up to half of your take-home pay so you can pursue the lifestyle that you want.These people are not retired in the traditional sense. Many early retirees work part-time on things that inspire them while they earn most of their income from their investment portfolios.""I like retirement calculators that provide actionable steps to get to where you want to go,"" said  Sam Dogen, creator of the personal finance website Financial Samurai, who retired in 2012 at age 34 after a 13-year career in finance. ""Achieving financial independence is really about taking action.""Here are tools developed by early retirees that can help you figure out if that lifestyle is right for you by answering these three key questions:Why should you retire early?Many online tools can tell you how much you should save for retirement, but few tell you why. The yFIRECalc can show you the trade-offs between working longer to save more money or retiring sooner to have more freedom.""I wanted to focus on the time aspect rather the money aspect of early retirement,"" said Steve, a 57-year-old lawyer who retired at age 48 in Boulder, Colorado, and who updated the yFIRECalc this year after learning JavaScript in his free time. (Since Steve blogs anonymously about the details of his net worth at FrugalFringe.com, he asked that his last name not be used.)The calculator gives you a snapshot of your life before and after early retirement based on the hours you will spend working, sleeping and left to your own devices. ""It's designed to help make early retirement more tangible,"" said Steve. ""The highest and best use of money is freedom.""  Where can you find places to save more?Peter Adeney, the popular blogger known as Mr. Money Mustache, has built a devoted following of people who strive for early retirement. Nicholas Marrone, a 38-year-old software engineer in Seattle who aims to have enough money to retire at age 47 if he wants, developed six simple calculators to help people live like a ""Mustachian"" at Mustache Calc.Many of Marrone's tools focus on the value of reducing your spending because increasing your income only helps when you're working while cutting expenses aids you throughout your retirement.One big area of savings: eliminating or reducing the cost of owning a car.""If you don't really account for all the expenses around owning a car, it is difficult to comprehend exactly how expensive it is to drive to work,"" said Marrone, who has a calculator that estimates the total cost of every mile you drive.That said, where to cut in your budget is a personal decision based on your priorities.""Question what really makes you happy. If owning fancy cars does it, then so be it. But if you are craving more time and freedom maybe that is too high of a cost to bear,"" Marrone said.More from Your Money Your Future:Frugal retirees ditch 4 percent rule, hoard savings insteadSix common myths that can really mess up your retirementSurvive your boomerang kids without depleting your retirement savingsAre you on track to retire early?Once you know why you want to retire early and where you can cut your expenses to save more, you need to benchmark your progress.Net worth is the best measure of how close you are to early retirement, said Dogen of Financial Samurai. Net worth is simply your assets minus your liabilities. Your assets include things like the money you have in your bank accounts, the value of your investments and your home. Your liabilities are what you owe, which includes your mortgage, student loans and credit-card debt.It's easy to figure out your net worth. You can do the calculation on a spreadsheet, by documenting your assets and liabilities, or use an app like Mint or Personal Capital that will track your net worth automatically.Dogen created net worth targets by age, income and work experience for early retirement. Compare your number to the benchmark to see how far you need to go.""The ultimate goal is to get to 20 times your gross annual income,"" Dogen said.

The S&P 500 fell 0.05 percent, with financials falling 0.8 percent to lead decliners.The Nasdaq composite dropped 0.1 percent.Crit Thomas, global market strategist at Touchstone Investments, said there are concerns the Federal Reserve may not be able to raise interest rates twice more, as it had previously forecast.""A lot of people assumed they'd raise in June and September, but now I'm hearing it may be June and December.

On Wednesday, the benchmark 10-year yield hovered near 2.19 percent; it began the year near 2.5 percent.Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, said the pullback in equities on Wednesday and Tuesday is reflective of ""a confluence of unfavorable factors.""""There is little indication that the US economy will reach its 3% growth this year, reform of health care and taxes remains a dream, and there are no projects as destinations to accept a surge in infrastructure spending,"" he said.

For instance, if you have a brokerage account, you could be on the hook for a tax as high as 20 percent, plus a 3.8 percent net investment income tax. Other holdings could be subject to federal income taxes, which have a top rate of 39.6 percent.You may encounter additional complications related to  estate and gift tax planning, too: U.S. citizens generally can exclude up to $5.49 million from estate taxes.Once you give up your citizenship, your stateside heirs could be on the hook for a 40 percent tax on assets they receive from you or your estate.""Since the person expatriated, the U.S. can't claim taxes from the donor,"" said Joshua Ashman, a CPA and co-founder of Expat Tax Professionals.

214,Islamic State fighters seal off Mosul mosque preparing for last stand,Business News,31-05-2017,"Smoke billows from behind the Great Mosque of al-Nuri in Mosul's Old City on April 17, 2017, during an offensive by Iraqi security forces to recapture the city from Islamic State.Islamic State militants have closed the streets around Mosul's Grand al-Nuri Mosque, residents said, apparently in preparation for a final showdown in the battle over their last major stronghold in Iraq.Dozens of fighters were seen by residents taking up positions in the past 48 hours around the medieval mosque, the site where Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared an Islamist caliphate in July 2014.Islamic State's black flag has been flying from the mosque since the militants captured Mosul and seized swathes of Iraq and Syria in the summer of 2014.U.S.-backed Iraqi government forces retook eastern Mosul in January and began a new push on Saturday to capture the group's remaining enclave in western Mosul, comprising of the Old City center where the mosque is located, and three adjacent districts alongside the western bank of the River Tigris.The fall of the city would, in effect, mark the end of the Iraqi half of the self-styled caliphate. Meanwhile in Syria, Kurdish forces backed by U.S.-air strikes are beseiging Islamic State forces in the city of Raqqa, the militants' de facto capital in that country.Up to 200,000 people still live in harrowing conditions behind Islamic State lines in Mosul, running low on food, water and medicine, and with difficult access to hospitals, the United Nations said on Sunday.The Grand al-Nuri Mosque has become a symbolic focus of the campaign, with Iraqi commanders privately saying they hope to capture it during Ramadan, the Muslim fasting month which started over the weekend in Iraq.""Daesh's fighters know that the mosque is the most important target and they are preparing for a major battle there,"" said Hisham al-Hashemi, who advises several Middle East government including Iraq's on Islamic State affairs.But a battle in or near the mosque would put the building and its famed leaning minaret at risk, experts have said.The minaret, several feet off the perpendicular and standing on humid soil, is particularly vulnerable as it has not been renovated since 1970. Its tilt gave the landmark its popular name - al-Hadba, or the hunchback.The Mosul offensive, now in its eighth month, has taken much more time than expected as Islamic State is fighting in the middle of civilians and using them as human shields.Over the past few days, the militants ordered dozens of families living in the Zanjili district to move into the Old City to prevent them from escaping toward the Iraqi forces trying to advance from the northern side, a resident said.Government forces have been dropping leaflets over the districts telling families to flee but the intensity of the fighting has prevented people from escaping.The militants been countering the offensive with suicide car and motorbike bombs, snipers, booby-traps and mortar fire.About 700,000 people, about a third of the pre-war city's population, have already fled, seeking refuge either with friends and relatives or in camps.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/islamic-state-fighters-seal-off-mosul-mosque-preparing-for-last-stand.html

China's steel PMI rose to 54.8 in May from 49.1 in April, Reuters reported, citing the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing.ANZ's senior China economist Betty Wang said in a note that the bank expects infrastructure investment to take a ""big role"" in supporting growth in the months ahead.""Infrastructure investment appears to have decoupled from the current financial deleveraging in our view. This, together with the jump in the steel sector PMI, may indicate a solid outlook for fixed asset investment,"" Wang wrote.Strong fixed asset investment will in turn help second quarter growth, which ANZ projects to reach 6.6 percent, higher than the official 6.5 percent target.Meanwhile, China's official services PMI rose to 54.5 in May from 54.0 in April. The services sector accounted for over half of the Chinese economy last year. A reading above 50 points to growth in the PMIs.But there are downside risks in the non-manufacturing PMI, warned ANZ.""The rebound was mainly supported by commercial services.

217,Steve Ballmer: We took too long to get into hardware when I was at Microsoft,Enterprise,30-05-2017,"Steve Ballmer speaking at the ReCode Conference on May 30, 2017.Asa Mathat | ReCodeLos Angeles Clippers owner and former  CEO Steve Ballmer on Tuesday said that under his leadership Microsoft didn't do enough to develop new capabilities in hardware. The comments come after Microsoft devices like the Surface Studio and Surface Book have been well received under Ballmer's successor, Satya Nadella.Microsoft did develop new capabilities in cloud services under his reign, Ballmer told Recode's Kara Swisher and Kurt Wagner at Recode's Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, on Tuesday. But when it comes to hardware, the company was not as proactive.""Companies get successful with an idea, with talent around the idea and with capability as a company to execute on the idea. It turns out if you want to have a second idea that is different than the first, you may need new talent, but you also need new capability. And you don't get new capability overnight,"" Ballmer said.""So if you're lucky enough to invent the first thing and the second thing before nobody else does, then you can build new capability. But I think I was too slow, in cases, to recognize the need for new capability. And particularly in hardware. I wish we'd built the capability to be a world-class hardware company, because one of the new expressions of software is essentially the hardware, and I think we came to that later than I think the company should have built that under my leadership should have built that capability earlier than we did."" During Ballmer's tenure -- from 2000 to 2014 -- Microsoft did introduce the Windows Phone platform, bringing the core operating system into the mobile age, and bought Nokia to try and kickstart a mobile handset business in 2013. However, the Windows Phone platform never took off, and the company has since written down the value of the Nokia purchase and essentially exited the phone business. The company also unveiled the Surface convertible tablet. That product stumbled early on -- in 2013 Microsoft made a $900 million write-down for the Surface RT -- but it has recovered with the release of new versions. With Ballmer as CEO, Microsoft grew its enterprise business from non-existent to about $20 billion in revenue per year, while maintaining high profits on the company's traditional cash cows, Windows and Office. But and 's Google ended up dominating the mobile market, and Amazon is now making strong strides in hardware with its Echo home assistant device.""The thing I would say we missed with Phone is we tried to use the old techniques -- software licensing and blah, blah, blah,"" Ballmer said. ""We tried to use all the same techniques, and the same techniques were never going to get us there. We had the wrong monetization model, we had the wrong delivery model -- all of that, and it's because we didn't build new capability.""But the company has since developed that new hardware capability under Nadella, Ballmer said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/30/steve-ballmer-we-took-too-long-to-get-into-hardware-when-i-was-at-microsoft.html

The VC and analyst raced through more than 300 slides in less than an hour, dropping a wealth of knowledge and analysis in a very short period of time.Here were some of the most startling statistics she shared.85% of new online advertising dollars spent now go to Google and Facebook.20% of queries on Google's mobile platform are done using voice instead of text.Retail store closings could break a 20-year record this year, as Amazon is opening new retail stores. Amazon has become a leading supplier of baby wipes and batteries.Gaming is more important than a lot of onlookers think, Meeker argued, as many trends that are all over the internet today started with gaming. For instance, emoji can be seen as an outgrowth of badges, originally introduced by Activision back in the early 1980s, and Nvidia started with a gaming focus in 1996, and is now used for artificial intelligence. Some gaming stats:There are 2.6 billion online gamers in the world, up from 100 million in 1995.The average gamer's age in the U.S. is 35 -- higher than many people think.161 million people watch e-sports every month.India is the fastest growing economy in the world, and ""consumers are winning"" as the internet speeds ahead.Indian consumers spend more time on Android phones than users in any other country except ChinaIndia is the leading market for Google Play downloads.4 of the top 10 apps downloaded in India come from Facebook -- WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Facebook, and Instagram.Indian consumers spend 7x as much time on their phones as they do watching TV, and 45% of that mobile time is spent on entertainment.Other topics included media disruption, China, and growing levels of U.S. debt.

219,Alphabet expands Waze\xe2\x80\x99s carpool service \xe2\x80\x94 giving Uber a fiercer rival in its home state California,Tech,31-05-2017,"Linda Davidson | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesWaze's carpooling service will expand to all of California next week, the company announced Wednesday.The expansion of Waze Carpool, which begins Tuesday, provides another option for California's tech-savvy commuters, and could ramp up competition for transportation technology start-ups like Uber and Lyft.Waze's app allows commuters to input traffic hazards and slowdowns and see a crowd-sourced map of commuting delays. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, bought Israeli-developed Waze in 2013, integrating Google's extensive mapping and geolocation services into the app.More recently, the traffic-tracking social app has been running pilots of a service that allows users to pick up passengers along a planned route in Israel and several California communities.Alphabet is ""very happy"" with how the pilots went, said Josh Fried, head of Waze Carpool. He said the San Francisco pilot is growing every week, though he declined to share specific numbers, citing the competitive atmosphere.Unlike ride-hailing services, Waze Carpool caps payments, and drivers are limited to two rides a day. That way, the company said, drivers will be reimbursed for the wear-and-tear on their car, but will not use the carpooling app as a full-time gig.Drivers get a maximum rate of 54 cents per mile on Waze Carpool \xe2\x80\x94 the IRS limit that differentiates income and reimbursement for gas mileage and wear-and-tear \xe2\x80\x94 meaning drivers shouldn't have to declare the rides as a source of income on their taxes.Still, for such a small payment, taking a detour to pick up a stranger may seem like an unlikely scenario. But Fried said Waze's community differentiates it from ride-hailing services that can provide higher payments and fast service.Users can vet the drivers on social media, and even use Waze Carpool as a networking opportunity for those who live nearby, Fried said, not unlike the way Airbnb promises the opportunity not just for cheap accommodations, but to build a relationship with a local.Through the pilot programs, Waze has learned how to optimize waiting times and driving times for both parties to make sure it's convenient, Fried said.""Carpool for us is a really big bet,"" Fried said. ""It embodies what we think makes the best of Waze: our innovative technology, our expertise in complex routing and our friendly community that's in it to help each other out. For years, folks on the Waze platform have helped each other out by contributing to data. Now they are able to really take a sizable step in reducing congestion by taking cars off the road.""It's yet another in a series of moves by Alphabet, which has invested in both Uber and Lyft, to build a burgeoning transportation empire. Fried even said that Waze benefits from ""friends in the ride-hailing industry"" that have gotten people comfortable with seeing cars pick them up on a screen.Alphabet has also invested heavily in self-driving car technologies through its Waymo arm, which according to data has a sizable lead over rivals like Uber and Tesla in that arena.""Google has always been known for taking multiple bets in the same category \xe2\x80\x94 like messaging,"" Fried said.

Yet, McCormack warns its appeal is diminished by the broader political threats facing the euro zone and the possibility of more member states following the U.K. out the door following last summer's Brexit outcome.Turning to the renminbi, while McCormack acknowledges that the Chinese currency is rapidly gaining importance as a trading tender, he maintains that it is not yet truly a risk-free asset given its sovereign rating and that China still seems ""some distance"" from having an open capital account and fully internationalized currency, even if it were able to secure a higher rating.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

221,Exxon shareholders approve measure on climate-change report,Energy,31-05-2017,"VIDEO0:5600:56Exxon shareholders approve measure on climate-change reportNews VideosExxon Mobil shareholders on Wednesday approved a proposal calling for the oil company to disclose the impact on its business of compliance with global climate change guidelines, an issue at the heart of a probe by two state attorneys general.A preliminary tally showed the non-binding proposal passed with 62.3 percent of ballots cast, the world's largest publicly traded oil company said. The sizeable increase over last year's 38 percent support for a similar report signaled the non-binding proposal was backed by at least some of Exxon's top institutional shareholders.Exxon had stepped up efforts to persuade investors to vote against climate-related proposals at Wednesday's annual meeting with a campaign of calling, writing and lobbying shareholders in person.The world's largest publicly traded oil company opposed the proposal requiring it to report on the risks to its business from new technologies and global climate change policies, insisting it already provides the information.The stakes have gotten higher since the last vote. The business-impact issue is central to lawsuits by two state attorneys general alleging Exxon soft-peddled the risks to consumers and shareholders. Wall Street support of similar measures also has convinced energy companies including Occidental Petroleum to address the Paris climate accord's goal of keeping global temperature increases under 2-degrees Celsius.Had the proposal garnered less than last year's 38 percent support, it would have endorsed Exxon's view which is that its current reporting is appropriate, said Rob Schuwerk, senior counsel for environmental think tank Carbon Tracker Initiative.But with support this year in excess of 50 percent, the oil company will likely do more to explain potential business impacts from having to meet the Paris agreement's temperature goal, Schuwerk said prior to the vote. A result in between the two, he said, would have been ""the hazy middle"" that would still show growing investor interest in climate issues.Exxon took a conciliatory approach in a letter to investors on Tuesday. Vice President Jeff Woodbury wrote that on many of the shareholder proposals ""the corporation agrees with the underlying objective \xe2\x80\x94 we just have a different view on the best means to achieve it.""Prior shareholder letters insisted the proposals were misguided or ignored the company's efforts to spell out its position that even in a world intent on limited temperature rises, it would still need more oil.Anne Sheehan, head of corporate governance at California State Teachers' Retirement System, which backed the additional climate reporting, said Exxon's letter had suggested the voting was at least very close and would go against the company.""You're not going to do an eleventh-hour shareholder communication if everything was going swimmingly,"" she said in an interview.In addition to the vote on the climate-impact report, Exxon holders considered proposals to shift spending to dividends and buybacks from oil exploration and on a proposal to require a report on its efforts to restrict emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas.Exxon opposed all these proposals and has actively lobbied shareholders. This campaign ""is a lot more intense than normal,"" said one investor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""I think they're pulling out all the stops.""Billboards and ralliesClimate campaigners were also active ahead of Wednesday's vote. They organized rallies and held media briefings. In Dallas, where the meeting is taking place, they have put up billboards and signs seeking to sway votes.Changes have been driven by institutional holders shifting their positions. Big investors including State Street and BlackRock, which together hold about 9 percent of Exxon shares, recently made clear they are now giving more attention to climate issues.Bob Litterman, chairman of the risk committee at asset-management firm Kepos Capital and who holds derivatives betting that oil companies will underperform the S&P 500 index, said pressures on Exxon to spell out the potential impact of a global warming on the value of its energy assets will only grow.""Whether it's shareholders or attorneys general or the passage of time, they're going to have to become honest about the potential for their assets to be stranded,"" or become uneconomic to pursue, said Litterman.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/exxon-steps-up-efforts-to-sway-shareholders-on-climate-report-vote.html

225,Singapore Exchange goes after tech start-ups to boost appeal as a listing destination,Finance,31-05-2017,"Singapore's sole stock exchange is gunning for more initial public offerings from technology firms as it seeks to alter perception that the city state is an attractive listing destination only for real estate investment trusts (REITs).To do that, it has tied up with the city state's technology and media regulator to help young tech companies in Singapore prepare to list on the exchange.The partnership between the Singapore Exchange (SGX) and Infocomm Media Development Authority will see the two parties work with lawyers, audit firms and IPO sponsors to offer advisory and financial support to companies looking to list on the exchange.Doing so will lower the barriers for tech companies to access the Singapore capital markets, SGX and IMDA said in a statement on Wednesday.SGX CEO Loh Boon Chye speaks after the exchange announced its latest effort to attract more IPOs.Yen Nee Lee l CNBC""The actual (listing) cost is one aspect of it, any efficiency on that ground is a good thing\xe2\x80\xa6 but the key (advantage) is time-to-market,"" said Chew Sutat, SGX's equities and fixed income head. He added that getting start-ups prepared earlier to go public can speed up the listing process. A listing on the exchange's Catalist board, for example, can be completed in as quickly as two months, he said.SGX has in recent years stepped up efforts to lure a greater number of IPOs amid concerns of its waning appeal as a listing destination. Departures outnumbered new listings on the exchange last year, and several Singapore companies have opted to list overseas such as in Hong Kong, Australia or the United States.Competition for IPOs has also heated up, with several exchanges in Asia, such as those in South Korea and Thailand, setting up trading platforms for start-ups in an attempt to lead them to eventually list on their stock exchanges.The SGX, too, wants a slice of growing tech start-up pie in the region.""We think a lot of the news out there about Singapore not being a growth market, Singapore not being an exciting market for growth stories for technology is probably overblown,"" said Chew.He added that there are about 80 tech companies listed on the SGX today with a market capitalization of 80 billion Singapore dollars ($57.8 billion).

""This concerning growth in our trade deficit presents new challenges and shows us that there is considerable potential to improve further our important trade relationship.""Lighthizer and other Trump administration trade officials have pledged to work to reduce U.S. bilateral trade deficits with major trading partners. The $32 billion deficit with Vietnam last year -- the sixth largest U.S. trade deficit -- reflects growing imports of Vietnamese semiconductors and other electronics products in addition to more traditional sectors such as footwear, apparel and furniture.The trade issue has become a potential irritant in a relationship where Washington and Hanoi have stepped up security cooperation in recent years given shared concerns about China's increasingly assertive behavior in East Asia.Phuc's meeting with Trump makes him the first southeast Asian leader to visit the White House under the new administration.It reflected calls, letters, diplomatic contacts and lower-level visits that started long before Trump took office in Washington, where Vietnam retains a lobbyist at $30,000 a month.Vietnam was disappointed when Trump ditched the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact, in which Hanoi was expected to be one of the main beneficiaries, and focused U.S. trade policy on reducing deficits.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/vietnam-to-sign-deals-for-up-to-17-bln-in-u-s-goods-services-prime-minister.html
227,Deja vu? Student subprime debt surges 32 percent,Economy,31-05-2017,"VIDEO1:1701:17How to deal with college debtCollege Game Plan As the total student loan debt continues to surge, the quality of borrowers is in steep decline.The total level of debt for so-called deep subprime borrowers totaled $8.2 billion in the first quarter of 2017, a jump of 32 percent from the same period a year ago, according to SNL Financial citing data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The category applies to borrowers with less than a 580 credit score.""It was the first year-over-year increase in more than two years and the largest jump since 2009 when high unemployment rates from the Great Recession sent many consumers back to school,"" SNL researchers said in a note.Household debt overall just recently passed the peak it hit before the Great Recession. New York Federal Reserve figures show total household debt at $12.73 trillion, $50 billion above where it stood in the third quarter of 2008.Of that total, a record $1.34 trillion is education-related, about 11 percent of which is considered seriously delinquent, or at least 90 days past due. That rate is actually a bit lower than the 11.2 percent at the end of 2016.Despite the seemingly grim trends, economists are not especially alarmed.In general, they believe the subprime debt situation shows little danger of spiraling into a similar situation as the financial crisis. In the event that triggered the recession, poor-quality mortgage borrowers defaulted in droves, setting off a liquidity crisis on Wall Street that spread through the broader economy.Michael Pearce, a U.S. economist at Capital Economics cites several trends: The growth in household net worth \xe2\x80\x94 $92.8 trillion at the end of 2016 compared with $56.2 trillion at the end of 2008 \xe2\x80\x94 along with the debt to household worth and its nature.The rise in student debt is potentially a bigger concern, because it has been going on for more than a decade with no end in sight,Michael PearceU.S. economist, Capital EconomicsWhile a big number, the $1.34 trillion total for all student debt does not represent near the $10.6 trillion of mortgage debt outstanding at the peak of the crisis. (Interestingly, the $1.3 trillion amount of subprime debt alone then was about equal to the total student loan indebtedness now.) Also, most of the student debt is backed by the government, not the private sector.""Overall, there is little sign that we are approaching a tipping point after which we will see a sudden increase in defaults,"" Pearce said in a recent note. ""And the bigger picture remains that the overall household debt burden is stable and still well below its previous peak.""Still, he notes that combined with the surge in auto loans, which have seen their highest delinquency rates in four years, Americans are getting a little stretched on credit.""The rise in student debt is potentially a bigger concern, because it has been going on for more than a decade with no end in sight,"" Pearce added. ""The sharper increase in average debt among older borrowers suggest that there is a rising share of the population struggling to repay legacy student debt.""Donghoon Lee, research officer at the New York Fed, said in a statement that the rising debt levels are ""neither a reason to celebrate nor a cause for alarm"" and Pearce generally agrees, though he sees potential dangers should the economy go south.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/student-subprime-debt-surges-32-percent.html

Bixby was deployed in Korea earlier this month.Despite what might sound like a delay, this is still in line with Samsung's plans to fully launch Bixby this spring, which ends June 21.Currently, Bixby exists as a piece of software on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus that provides at-a-glance information at news, trending topics on Twitter, upcoming events and more. It's not very useful, and it hasn't lived up to expectations that Bixby will compete with Apple's Siri or Google Assistant.Part of the team that built Siri is now working on Bixby at Samsung, though the company has said that team didn't participate in building the current version of Bixby.Part of the delay is being attributed to Bixby's rough experience trying to ""comprehend English syntax and grammar,"" the Journal said.""Bixby Voice benefits from time to further enhance natural language understanding, and we are currently growing our user testing in the U.S. to prepare for launch,"" a Samsung spokesperson told CNBC.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/galaxy-s8-bixby-will-launch-at-end-of-june.html

He then tweeted that he would make an announcement this week.Governments around the world expressed concern over the reports. ""Like you, I've seen the reports but I don't have any information beyond that,"" German government spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer told reporters.""So I can only reiterate the well-known position that the German government unequivocally supports the Paris climate agreement and is campaigning for it to be quickly implemented and hopes the USA remains committed to this agreement,"" she added.Finland's prime minister, Juha Sipila, told parliament on Wednesday that if the United States withdraws from the Paris climate deal, it would be a major reversal. ""If this is true, it is a big setback. Then, we must find partners to continue, because this work must not stop,"" Sipila said. The decision also drew a reaction from the United Nations, with the organization's main Twitter page quoting Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as saying: ""Climate change is undeniable. Climate change is unstoppable. Climate solutions provide opportunities that are unmatchable,"" according to The Associated Press. However, the European Union stands ready to take on the mantle of leadership on this issue, according to the European Commission. ""If they decide to pull out it would be disappointing but I really do not think this would change the course of mankind,"" said European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic.""There is a much stronger expectation from our partners across the world from Africa, Asia and China that Europe should assume leadership in this effort and we are ready to do that,"" Sefcovic added.The decision to withdraw from the climate accord was influenced by a letter from 22 Republican U.S. senators, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, calling for an exit, Axios reported.Former President Barack Obama, who helped broker the accord, praised the agreement during a trip to Europe this month.The United States is the world's second-biggest carbon dioxide emitter behind China.Supporters of the climate pact are concerned that a U.S. exit could lead other nations to weaken their commitments or also withdraw, softening an accord that scientists have said is critical to avoiding the worst impacts of climate change.Canada, the European Union, and China have said they will honor their commitments to the accord even if the United States withdraws. A source told Reuters that India had also indicated it would stick by the deal.Trump had vowed during his campaign to ""cancel"" the Paris deal within 100 days of becoming president, as part of an effort to bolster U.S. oil and coal industries. That promise helped rally supporters sharing his skepticism of global efforts to police U.S. carbon emissions.After taking office, however, Trump faced pressure to stay in the deal from investors, international powers and business leaders, including some in the coal industry. He also had to navigate a split among his advisors on the issue.-- CNBC.com contributed to this report.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/trump-pulling-us-out-of-paris-climate-deal-axios.html
231,"There's room for more than one 'love brand' in phones, says the COO of Andy Rubin's new company",Tech,30-05-2017,"Andy Rubin of EssentialCorbis Historical | James Leynse | GettyAndroid creator Andy Rubin unveiled a new phone from his new company on Tuesday \xe2\x80\x94 a phone that is the underdog in a world of giants.The scrappy 100-person company, Essential, revealed a titanium and ceramic phone ahead of the Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, where Rubin is slated to speak on Tuesday night. In addition to its expansive screen and damage-resistant exterior, the phone also sports a magnetic port for attachments. Essential has no small task before it: It's taking on two of the world's richest public companies, Apple and Alphabet. It's also competing with companies like Samsung, Amazon and Facebook in its home and VR platforms.But as content like ""Mr. Robot"" or ""The Circle"" demonizes big tech, Essential hopes to paint itself as a defender of American consumers.The first attachment is one of the smallest 360-degree cameras on the market. The exterior also allows a thinner phone with a larger screen than iPhones or Pixels \xe2\x80\x94 at a time when consumers are choosing between phones that all look the same, said Niccolo De Masi, president and chief operating officer of Essential, told CNBC on Tuesday.""It used to mean something \xe2\x80\x94 your selection, your choice,"" said De Masi, formerly of Glu Mobile. He said that consumers perceive their smartphone choices today as ""boring,"" with innovation that's incremental and lacks ""passion."" To be sure, the ""distinctive"" appearance of the Essential phone would not be hard to recreate \xe2\x80\x94 patents show that Apple is already looking into ceramic finishes. Copycatting runs rampant in Silicon Valley, often to great success. Most recently, Facebook's Instagram recreated many well-loved Snapchat features. Apple once waged war on Samsung over intellectual property surrounding the iPhone. Apple itself has been accused of copying Xerox.De Masi said he expects Essential to be copied.""There is a fair amount of intellectual property protecting our devices,"" De Masi. ""But at the same time, consumers don't care about that as much as who was first. I don't think people get much credence in the Western world for being copycats. We know people will copy us. These devices will show up in plastic and cheaper materials in all sorts of markets around the world. Our goal is not to be near-looking."" The camera is part of Essential's larger vision to allow consumers to switch out parts of their phone as technology improves without swapping the whole phone. Essential's $700 price tag aims to present more ""pro-consumer"" profit margins than competitors like Apple and Samsung, De Masi said.""We're not pricing ourselves at two or three times the cost of materials,"" De Masi said. ""Like, consumers complain about how many dongles they have to buy. We're doing away with those.""De Masi doesn't think that Asian brands like Xiaomi will expand as ""love brands"" in the U.S., despite their cheaper prices. Even if Essential used foreign suppliers, prototyping in Silicon Valley keeps Essential at the bleeding edge of innovation, De Masi said.""There is room in the market, in the Western world, for another, what I call, 'love brand,'""  De Masi said. ""I think Apple has done a good job on that over the past 30 years. I think everyone else has either retrenched or are seen as foreign brands."" Other brands, like Motorola and even Google, have tried to release modular phones with interchangeable parts, to little success. But  De Masi said that the manufacturing process has become easy enough that creating nimble, beautiful phones is now easier and cheaper.But despite his criticism of other cookie-cutter phones, De Masi said that Essential's modular phones will not enable options like changing the color of chassis because they are not ""meaningful innovation."" One of the first arenas where Essential will compete is VR, specifically 360 videos. It's an area that Google's Daydream and even Facebook are trying to win. New Essential smartphones in black and white, with 360-degree video attachment.CNBC""We believe it's going to democratize 360-video,"" De Masi said.

The report is expected to show 185,000 jobs added in May. Weekly jobless claims and first quarter productivity and costs are reported at 8:30 a.m. ET.Monthly vehicle sales will be reported throughout the morning and are expected to show about a 16.8 million vehicle annualized selling pace.Manufacturing activity will be reported in the Manufacturing PMI at 9:45 a.m. and the ISM manufacturing report at 10 a.m. April construction spending is expected at 10 a.m.The batch of data is important since second quarter data has been spotty, even though economists still expect a 3 percent growth rate.The bond market has also been bucking up against expectations for two Federal Reserve rate hikes this year, and currently futures markets only forecast 1.4 interest rate hikes, with a quarter point rate hike expected June 14.""The market is starting to focus on Friday and the employment numbers, which should look pretty good once again, but then move onto the CPI which should look like another sluggish number,"" said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies. Economists expect 185,000 nonfarm payrolls in the Friday report, according to Thomson Reuters. CPI is reported June 14, hours before the release of the Fed statement and interest rate action.The PCE deflator, reported earlier this week, showed a soft pace of core inflation at 1.5 percent. There has been concern inflation is slowing to the point where it could affect the Fed's rate hiking path, but the Fed has said it sees soft inflation as transitory.McCarthy said both numbers should look solid enough for the Fed to raise interest rates. ""You'd have to get near catastrophic numbers for employment and the CPI to get the Fed to hold off raising rates at that meeting,"" he said.Markets will also be watching U.S. government data on oil and gas inventories, after U.S. oil futures sold off 2.7 percent on concerns that new supplies keep hitting the world oil market even as OPEC tries to hold back production.Federal Reserve Gov.

235,The billionaire gadfly in exile who stared down Beijing,Real Estate,31-05-2017,"Guo WenguiJames Estrin | The New York TimesThe biggest political story in China this year isn't in Beijing. It isn't even in China. It's centered at a $68 million apartment overlooking Central Park in Manhattan.That's where Guo Wengui, a billionaire in self-imposed exile, has hurled political grenades at the Chinese Communist Party for months, accusing senior leaders of graft using Twitter as his loudspeaker. He escalated his attack by claiming that members of the family of China's second most powerful official, who oversees the country's anticorruption effort, secretly own a large stake in a major Chinese  conglomerate.The Chinese government responded by unleashing the state-controlled media to enumerate Mr. Guo's alleged frauds, and asking Interpol to put out a global warrant for his arrest.More from New York Times:India's bad debt is looking better to investorsEven as wind power rises, it falls under a political cloudChina detains activist who worked at manufacturer of Ivanka Trump shoesBut then something unexpected happened. China stood down. The state media campaign against him tapered off. In mid-May, Mr. Guo announced on Twitter that his wife and daughter \xe2\x80\x94 previously barred from leaving China \xe2\x80\x94 had been allowed to visit him in New York.""We need to root out some of the robbers of this country,"" Mr. Guo, referring to China, told two New York Times reporters this month at his apartment. To emphasize the point, he wrote it out in Chinese in a notebook. ""We are against using corruption to root out corruption.""Mr. Guo's allegations are unproved, and some of his claims have been outlandish and easily debunked. Yet amid his barrage of charges about China's powerful and wealthy are claims that have turned out to be  accurate. And the government's treatment of Mr. Guo, whose former political patron was one of China's highest-ranking intelligence officials, suggests he may be taken seriously, perhaps even supported, by some officials in Beijing.Mr. Guo's most recent claims have reverberated across China and fed unease on Wall Street about doing business there. The assertions, if substantiated, could upend politics in China, the world's second-biggest economy, possibly driving a wedge between President Xi Jinping and Wang Qishan, the anticorruption czar.Mr. Wang, the focus of Mr. Guo's allegations, has close ties to Wall Street, with enormous influence over China's financial sector. Mr. Guo's assertions come just months before a Communist Party meeting that will decide whether Mr. Wang, recently the focus of speculation that he may become China's next prime minister, will remain on the party's elite Politburo Standing Committee.Mr. Guo's Twitter broadsides have continued, and his ability to stare down the world's most powerful authoritarian nation has underscored the mystery, in China and abroad, about how he acquired his billions, what he knows and who, if anyone, is backing him.Ruthless, or a hero?Mr. Guo's ambitions, like his personality, are big and sometimes baffling. He says he has a plan to exorcise graft from the party, bring rule of law to China and put ties with America on a stable track by ending decades of Chinese skulduggery on trade. At other times, he explains his corruption allegations as an act of vengeance for a long-ago death. He could just be a man feeling pressure, his assets frozen in China, and  bad investments and lawsuits chipping away at his fortune.No one better represents the marriage of the party and money than Mr. Guo, known as Miles Kwok outside China, who parlayed relationships with some of China's most powerful officials to help build a global portfolio including hotels, office buildings and securities brokerage firms.Show Mr. Guo a spreadsheet listing the shareholders of the giant Chinese company  HNA, which has been buying up businesses in the West, and he'll rattle off the names of the prominent families that he claims really control their stakes. Ask him to map out family trees for those names, the key to tracking ill-gotten wealth in China, and he'll do it from memory, down to the sisters, the cousins and the aunts.""The allegations with regard to HNA simply aren't true,"" a spokesperson for HNA said.Over a decade ago, the Chinese Communist Party welcomed businessmen into its ranks. In turn, those tycoons helped make the sons and daughters of the revolution rich while helping the country show spectacular growth rates. Now, armed with information, one of them has strayed.""These people have power and influence and knowledge,"" said William C. Kirby, a professor at Harvard Business School. ""Many of them are easily controlled. But others go off the reservation.""Mr. Guo has gone farther than anyone else. When the party retaliated against him, the state-controlled Beijing News reported that he was suspected of obtaining a ""fraudulent loan"" worth 3.2 billion renminbi ($466 million) from one state-owned bank. Another publication, Caixin, referring to documents from Mr. Wang's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, said that Mr. Guo had arranged for $299 million of client funds at a securities firm he controlled to be illegally transferred out of it.The government's most potent weapon was the release in April of a videotaped confession by Ma Jian, a former spymaster and political patron to Mr. Guo. He said he had accepted more than $8.7 million in gifts from Mr. Guo in exchange for favors, including frequent interventions with officials to short-circuit any obstacles to his property projects. ""Guo Wengui, to ingratiate himself with me, to thank me, and to maintain his relationship with me, gave me a huge amount of benefits,"" Mr. Ma said in the video. Mr. Guo did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. Guo's presence in the United States poses a dilemma for the Trump administration, which is seeking China's cooperation to rein in North Korea's nuclear ambitions. In recent years Mr. Guo provided Washington with insights into Chinese politics through his visits with embassy officials in Beijing, according to a former senior administration official.Mr. Guo, who is a  member of Mar-a-Lago, President Trump's private Palm Beach club, is eager to get close to the powerful. On Tuesday, he wrote on Twitter that he flew to Washington for meetings at the Trump International Hotel. He contributed to charitable work by Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, who calls him a friend.When the Times reporters visited Mr. Guo's apartment at the Sherry-Netherland hotel in late April, he stepped away to take a phone call in another room, with the speakerphone on. His assistant explained that a top aide to Mr. Xi was on the line. The implication was obvious: Despite his unprecedented public tirades against some top officials, Mr. Guo was communicating with the one who matters most.As with many of Mr. Guo's claims, it wasn't possible to verify who was on the other end of the call, but the episode was fully in keeping with Mr. Guo's showman personality. That flair for the dramatic is typical of him, said one longtime acquaintance who was present when he took calls from Mr. Ma, the former intelligence official.Many Chinese dissidents and journalists working outside the state media umbrella cast Mr. Guo as a hero for his outspoken criticism. Some who know him, though, say that he can be ruthless. A Beijing vice mayor who once stood in the way of his securing property rights for an elaborate plaza at the 2008 Olympic Games park was ousted and given a suspended death sentence for bribery after Mr. Guo  obtained a tape showing the official having sex with a mistress.Mr. Guo also takes aim at news organizations that write unflattering articles about him. In 2015, Caixin wrote an investigative article about his business and political connections. In response, Mr. Guo accused its editor of having an affair and a child with his former business partner. Caixin is suing Mr. Guo for libel.His public attacks against the leadership of the country he fled two years ago began in January. Through Twitter, and in a  televised interview last month on Voice of America, Mr. Guo said a top police official, at the behest of Mr. Xi, had asked him several years ago to look into Mr. Wang's family finances.When the Chinese government eased up on its attacks against Mr. Guo, the about-face suggested that the Communist Party's top leadership may not agree on how to deal with him, according to Victor Shih, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, who studies finance and politics in China.""If the party were unified in opposing Guo Wengui, his family would have had much harsher treatment,"" he said.Seeking revengeAway from his homeland, Mr. Guo still enjoys the high life. On Twitter, where his profile page portrays him as a male version of the Mockingjay from the ""Hunger Games"" series, he showed off his new private Airbus jet. When giving a tour of his 18th-floor New York apartment \xe2\x80\x94 shared with a bichon fris\xc3\xa9 puppy \xe2\x80\x94 he pointed out the Lalique crystal chandelier, Louis XVI furniture and an ancient Chinese watercolor painting. The monthly maintenance fees alone for the apartment are $58,000.Mr. Guo boasts of multiple residences around the world, including in Beijing, London, Tokyo, Abu Dhabi and Hong Kong. His oceanside home there, with sweeping views of Repulse Bay, sits on two lots that Mr. Guo's son bought for 880 million Hong Kong dollars ($113 million) in 2011, according to property records.His lakeside property in Beijing is modeled on a traditional one-story courtyard home but is far more elaborate, with multiple levels, a cavernous closet with hundreds of identical suits, and a pool, in a complex of more than 86,000 square feet. One real estate agent in Beijing estimated its value at about $230 million.Mr. Guo took Mr. Kirby, then a Harvard dean, on a two-hour tour of the property in 2004. The group was ushered into a private theater, the lights dimmed, and Johann Strauss Sr.'s ""Radetzky March"" began to play as Mr. Guo made a videotaped introduction to a development he planned near the site of the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. He and a Beijing vice mayor then asked Harvard to locate a campus on the complex, Mr. Kirby recalled.At dinner, he pressed his case, all the while watching a Chinese soap opera on a tiny television screen. ""It was, still to this day, the most bizarre evening I have ever spent in China,"" Mr. Kirby said. (Harvard did not take Mr. Guo up on his offer.)Mr. Guo says the motivation for his corruption allegations is simple: He claims the state shot one of his brothers in 1989 and he has been plotting his revenge ever since. The circumstances of the death are murky, though, like much of Mr. Guo's story.Mr. Guo says that during the 1989 Tiananmen student protests, he was arrested for giving money to the student movement and jailed for two years. But an overseas Chinese website, citing court documents, says that Mr. Guo had been arrested in a fraud involving oil sales and that his brother was killed when he and Mr. Guo attacked police officers.He says he was born in May 1970, one of 10 boys in a family with ties to the Chinese Army from a small town in eastern China's Shandong Province. (Legal documents say he was born in February 1967.) In prison, Mr. Guo, who has only a middle-school education, learned about Chinese history and other topics from educated inmates, he said.After his release in 1991, Mr. Guo met a prominent businesswoman who introduced him to wealthy investors. Soon after he built a hotel in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou, which became a meeting spot for government officials.Those contacts and relationships with other officials, including Mr. Ma, the spy chief, helped Mr. Guo build his empire. He expanded into finance, acquiring a large stake in a securities brokerage firm. In 2014, the Hurun Report, which tracks the fortunes of China's elite, estimated his wealth at $2.3 billion. But that same year, Mr. Guo's ambition to take control of one of China's biggest brokerage firms fell apart and he had a dispute with his business partner, who was later jailed.Since then, he has lived abroad and his assets in China \xe2\x80\x94 he claims 120 billion renminbi ($17.4 billion) in all \xe2\x80\x94 have been frozen. Mr. Guo is facing financial pressures.One hedge fund in Hong Kong, the Pacific Alliance Asia Opportunity Fund, recently sued him in New York, saying that he owes $88 million, a sum that includes millions of dollars in interest in loans from 2008. The fund wants to seize his New York apartment.Last year, he sued the Swiss bank UBS, arguing that he was misled in a series of transactions that resulted in a $500 million loss for him, but the suit was dismissed. Caixin published an article last week saying that Mr. Blair had introduced Mr. Guo to Abu Dhabi's crown prince. Mr. Guo later used money from Abu Dhabi to finance a failed takeover of a Chinese securities firm, which resulted in the loss, Caixin reported.A representative for Mr. Blair did not address whether Mr. Blair had made introductions for Mr. Guo. Mr. Guo said the article was groundless.One claim Mr. Guo made in March regarding the hidden wealth of a prominent Chinese family  could be substantiated by company documents, The Times reported in April. Going after Mr. Wang, though, is particularly risky.Mr. Wang, 68, has a reputation for being a problem solver who has  worked closely with American executives, including Henry M. Paulson, the former chief executive of Goldman Sachs and Treasury secretary. His many prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9s are in influential positions throughout China's government.Mr. Wang did not respond to faxed questions sent to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection in Beijing.""Wang Qishan has been the model of clean and competent, and all but untouchable,"" said William Zarit, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. ""Should his star fall, business and government players should be concerned about their own safety.""There's no sign that Mr. Guo is letting up. Before the Communist Party meets this fall to pick a slate of top leaders, Mr. Guo plans his most dramatic assault of all: a live event, perhaps from Lincoln Center, that will focus on Chinese corruption.""I want it to be carnival-style with a big screen,"" he said. ""We will sing. We will cry and we will talk about the world."" Christopher Buckley and David Barboza contributed reporting. Kiki Zhao contributed research.

237,Michael Kors plans to shutter 100 to 125 stores; shares tumble 9%,Retail,31-05-2017,"VIDEO2:5802:58Kors shares slip after earnings, announces store closuresSquawk on the StreetAnother retailer has decided to trim its brick-and-mortar fleet. Michael Kors said Wednesday it will close 100 to 125 full-price stores over the next two years. The company had 827 retail locations as of April 1. The closures are intended to improve profitability, Michael Kors said. The retailer anticipates ongoing annual savings of $60 million as a result of this plan but will record a $125 million charge. Michael Kors, among many of its peers in the retail space, has been hurt by lagging sales and dwindling foot traffic as more shoppers choose to ring up purchases online. Further, the retailer has had a difficult time marketing its products at full price. Shares of the stock slid more than 9 percent during Wednesday morning after the luxury retailer said its fourth-quarter earnings had swung to a loss and it planned to trim its store fleet. Michael Kors posted a net loss of $26.8 million, or 17 cents per share, in the latest quarter, compared with net income of $177 million, or 98 cents per share, one year ago. Management said earnings were hurt by $193.8 million in noncash impairment charges that were related to some under-performing stores. Excluding those one-time charges, the company earned 73 cents a share, beating a Thomson Reuters analyst consensus estimate by 3 cents. ""Fiscal 2017 was a challenging year, as we continued to operate in a difficult retail environment with elevated promotional levels,"" CEO John Idol said in a statement. ""In addition, our product and store experience did not sufficiently engage and excite consumers.""Meanwhile, total revenue fell 11.2 percent to $1.06 billion, from $1.20 billion a year ago, Michael Kors reported. Analysts were expecting sales of $1.05 billion, according to a Thomson Reuters survey. Michael Kors said it now anticipates first-quarter sales of $910 million to $930 million, along with a same-store sales decline in the high-single digit range.A significant comparable sales decline of 14.1 percent for the latest period was bigger than the 13 percent drop forecast by a FactSet survey. ""Michael Kors' precipitous drop in sales does very little to reassure that the company's nascent recovery program is on track,"" GlobalData Retail Managing Editor Neil Saunders wrote in an email. ""Indeed, if anything it raises a question mark over whether management can win back [customers] as it tries to reinvigorate the brand.""Michael Kors is still carrying baggage from its past, Saunders went on. ""Customers alienated by its previous overexpansion and discounting have been given very few reasons to take a fresh look at the brand."" ""Looking ahead, it is clear that Michael Kors has further to fall.""One analyst, though, views Michael Kors' decision to close some of its under-performing locations as ""taking the knife out."" ""The first move was reducing wholesale exposure and now it's the announcement of > 100 stores over the next 1-2 years,"" Jefferies analyst Randal Konik wrote in an email. ""These moves are an important step in rightsizing points of distribution, which will improve [long term] brand equity, [capital return], and margin structure.""These moves further show the retailer pushing a ""reset"" button, Konik added. KORS 1-year performance\xc2\xa0As of Tuesday's market close, shares of Michael Kors have tumbled about 15 percent for both the year-to-date period and over the past 12 months.

Cowen purchased the brokerage earlier this year for $116 million in cash and common stock.The company is expected to announce the finalization of the deal Friday, according to a source familiar with the matter. In addition to Colas, Convergex CEO Eric Noll also won't be staying.In his farewell, Colas estimated that the note reached more than 5,000 recipients a day. Convergex itself has fewer than 3,000 clients.Nicholas ColasCNBCThe briefing stood out in a variety of ways. Several of the features have been copied by other analysts \xe2\x80\x94 in particular the use of a song lyric, usually from the classic rock catalog, as the title or as a unifying device for that particular day's theme. For Wednesday's farewell, Colas closed with the Rolling Stones:""You can't always get what you want, But if you try sometimes, well you just might find You get what you need.""While Colas usually kept the tone light during his years writing the briefing, the content was important.He was the first on the Street to write about digital currency bitcoin, was well ahead of his peers in recognizing the importance that exchange-traded funds would be playing in investor portfolios, and devised multiple ""off the grid"" indicators for the economy and markets. Among them were sales of used cars, Google search terms, and, of course, the Bacon Cheeseburger Index, which tracked the typical cost of the gastronomic delight as a proxy for inflation.Colas' move comes amid several other high-profile departures for sell-side analysts. Jim Paulsen's exit from Wells Capital Management earlier this year recently became official and he has started to write independent analysis again.""When I started writing these notes almost a decade ago, I never imagined how successful this effort would become,"" Colas said in his finale. ""But all good things must come to an end, and today is that day.""Colas did not respond to a request for further comment.

239,Israel reaches for the skies and the moon,Investing in: Israel,31-05-2017,"Astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr., is photographed walking near the Lunar Module during the Apollo 11 mission.NASA | Getty ImagesA telltale white plume streaked across the sky over Israel Monday morning, revealing the country's latest missile test. No announcement was made on what propulsion system was tested but experts say it was for an intercontinental ballistic missile or a missile defense rocket. Either way, it was a manifestation of Israel's activity in aerospace, a field in which it is developing significant new capabilities, including in the commercial sector.The country has developed missile systems, such as the Jericho and the Shavit, which has been used to launch its own military satellites into space, anti-missile systems such as the Iron Dome and the Arrow, and is dominating the international export market for military drones.One man who sits at the nexus of Israel's space and drone industries is Yariv Bash, co-founder of SpaceIL, the organization that seeks to put Israel on the moon, and CEO of drone startup Flytrex.With the latter he's seeking to put into place complete solutions for automated drone delivery. While the former, SpaceIL, is a finalist, one of only five in the world, in Google's Lunar X Prize competition for a privately funded moon landing.Bash spoke to CNBC about his passion for all things flying and how he expects the aerospace industry in Israel to develop.""I like to say that I found other people to pay for my hobbies. Seeing something hover above you in the air or seeing a spacecraft leaving the atmosphere, these are two of the most amazing feats you can do as an engineer.""What does Flytrex do, what are you currently capable of?""Our systems are capable of delivering up to three kilograms up to ten kilometers away. We can deliver everything. We have a complete system that allows you to drop packages from the air in a safe way, hovering at twenty meters above ground and lowering the package on a wire in a completely safe way that enables you to lower a package to someone.""Where Flytrex is currently seeking to operate, Bash will not divulge but he says that he expects that within the next quarter the company will be operating in an urban environment and he will seek a new funding round within the next few quarters. At the beginning of this year, Flytrex was reported to have raised $3 million from several angel and VC investors.How do you see the Israeli drone and aerospace industries develop?""It's like cyber[security]. Israel became a superpower when it comes to cyber startups because of the military capabilities and then you had personnel leaving the military and starting their own companies. I think it's a bit the same with the drone industry. We have a very successful military industry and drones are becoming more civilian. You see a lot of people leaving the military or the aviation industry today and beginning their own startups, joining other startups, to accomplish something on the industrial, commercial, civilian level.""How does Israel's international reputation in drones help Flytrex?""I have to say that with our clients I haven't seen them think well, the Israelis are great in military drones so Flytrex might be a good company. I think it mostly helps, the reputation, when you approach government officials. If you want to fly in certain countries you need to be in contact with the local civil aviation authorities, like the FAA in the United States. I think that when it comes to that, most of the countries, most aviation authorities already know Israel as a drone exporter and they most likely went through Israeli documentation and have approved Israeli drones before. They're more familiar with Israel, which really helps when you start the process with them.""With SpaceIL you've had a setback (when SpaceX's Falcon rocket blew up in 2016, delaying SpaceIL's launch date and possibly ending its X Prize chances). What will that mean?""It is rocket science, things sometimes explode and go off track. It did postpone a bit our efforts but we're building a spacecraft. It's amazing. Even if it's going to take a few more months than we anticipated, it's still an amazing project. In two months from now you'll be able to come to Israel and see the spacecraft being built. We'll be launching in 2018. We don't have a specific date yet but we're getting very close to the launch date, which is making things a lot harder and a lot more exciting.""So, SpaceIL will continue, even if it can no longer win the prize?""For us it's all about Israel reaching the moon, planting out flag there and exciting the next generation\xe2\x80\xa6 We're actually an education non-profit. Our main vision is impacting every kid in Israel... We'll be recreating something that in the '60s was called the Apollo effect. After the Apollo program kids went in increasing numbers to be scientists and engineers. Here in Israel that's our main vision and we're working to generate thousands and maybe even tens of thousands of new engineers for Israel a decade or two from now.""

240,This chart of oil stocks is a complete 'train wreck': Trader,Options Action,31-05-2017,"VIDEO2:1402:14Bet against a crude comeback?Options ActionEnergy stocks are getting crushed this year, and the pain is far from over, at least according to one trader.The oil and gas ETF, XOP, is down nearly 22 percent in 2017, and the options market has been piling into bearish bets on the group. One trade that stuck out on Tuesday was a bearish call that the XOP would fall by at least 6 percent in the next six weeks. Specifically, a trader sold out of 25,000 of the June 32/26 put spread and then bought to open 10,000 of the July 32-strike puts for 90 cents. That trader is betting that XOP will close below $31.10 by July expiration. The ETF was trading around $32.35 on Wednesday afternoon.Of the trade, Dan Nathan of RiskReversal.com told CNBC's ""Fast Money"" on Tuesday that the person was probably ""rolling out some bearish positioning or possibly a hedge.""While XOP has fallen to 10-month lows, ""crude oil is still up about 25 percent from its 52-week lows. It's trading really well on a relative basis to [XOP],"" Nathan said. ""That's telling you something about how investors feel about the stocks in general.""XOP ""is a bit of a train wreck here. It obviously was in a massive downtrend. It broke out, and now it's kind of failing,"" according to Nathan.Shares of XOP were down nearly 2 percent on Wednesday while crude had fallen 3 percent.

""The Fed is acting like it's coming, but is it?""Average hourly earnings have risen steadily, if mildly, over the past few years. Coming in at $26.19 in the April employment report, hourly earnings were at $25.54 a year before that, and $24.89 two years ago.As Wolff referred to, earnings will be closely watched by the Federal Reserve, since they are thought to have a close relationship with overall inflation.Tech leadershipInformation technology has easily been the best-performing sector this year, logging a gain of nearly 20 percent while the S&P 500 is up just 8 percent. In the month of May, the comparison has been even more stark, with the tech sector rising by more than 4 percent while the S&P 500 was up just 1.2 percent.Wolff pointed out that five tech stocks \xe2\x80\x94 Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet and Microsoft \xe2\x80\x94 have driven a huge share of the gains seen in the S&P 500 and in the Nasdaq 100 this year.""If this [rally] is going to last, that can't,"" the strategist said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/jobless-claims-and-tech-stocks-heres-what-could-drive-the-market-on-thursday.html

Grassley: US overpaid an estimated $1.27 billion for EpiPenClosing BellAmerican taxpayers may have been overcharged for EpiPen anti-allergy devices by as much as $1.27 billion over the course of a decade, a U.S. senator said Wednesday.That amount is nearly three times the $465 million that EpiPen's owner, the big drugmaker Mylan, last October said it agreed to pay the federal government to settle claims that it overcharged the government-run Medicaid system for the devices.""The fact that the EpiPen overpayment is so much more than anyone discussed publicly should worry every taxpayer,"" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.Grassley said he learned of the large disparity between Mylan's settlement amount and the potential overpayment by taxpayers from the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General after asking officials for an accounting of EpiPen overcharges.VIDEO2:4102:41Study: Expired Epipens may still be functional Closing BellMylan for years classified EpiPen as a generic drug for the purposes of Medicaid's drug rebate program, and as a result paid a lower rebate rate to Medicaid than did sellers of brand-name drugs. Officials have said that EpiPen, which is used to counteract a potentially fatal allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis, should have been treated as a brand-name product for Medicaid's rebate program.Medicaid is the joint federal-state program that provides health-care coverage to primarily low-income Americans.Grassley also said the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ""recently provided records to the committee that show Mylan was made aware of the misclassification years ago but did nothing."" ""It looks like Mylan overcharged the taxpayers for years with the knowledge EpiPen was misclassified, and the previous administration was willing to let the company off the hook,"" Grassley said, referring to the Obama administration.A spokeswoman for Mylan said, ''We have no comment beyond that we continue to work with the government to finalize the settlement as soon as possible.''Mylan faced strong public criticism last year for hiking the price of EpiPen to more than $600 for a two-pack, an increase of more than 500 percent in recent years.Outrage over the cost led Mylan to increase the amount of financial assistance it gave customers, and to later introduce a generic version of EpiPen that sold for half of the price of the brand-name version.VIDEO0:4400:44Mylan recalls 81K EpiPens outside USClosing BellAmid that controversy, a number of elected officials questioned whether Medicaid had been receiving the correct amount of rebates from Mylan for EpiPen sales within that program.Mylan for weeks had repeatedly denied underpaying the rebates. But, in October, it agreed to a settlement with the Justice Department to resolve such claims. It also agreed to treat EpiPen as a brand-name product for the purpose of rebates beginning this past April.However, in March, Mylan refused to say whether it would begin paying the higher rebate rate in April as scheduled.The rebate program imposes a 13 percent rebate on generic drugs. But sellers of brand-name drugs are required to pay a rate of at least 23.1 percent.However, the rebate for brand-name medications can be much higher if their sellers have raised the price of the product beyond the rate of inflation, as Mylan repeatedly did with EpiPen. In fact, Mylan's rebate rate for EpiPen could be so high that the company might have to pay Medicaid back nearly all of the money it made from selling the devices through the program. Mylan was sued in April by customers who claimed the company engaged in an illegal scheme to dramatically increase the price of EpiPen over the past decade.The suit alleged that the ""skyrocketing"" list price of EpiPen was the result of Mylan's payments of rebates to pharmacy benefit managers \xe2\x80\x94 including CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and Optum Rx \xe2\x80\x94 which handle prescription drug benefit programs for insurance plans.Mylan did not comment on the suit when it was filed.Watch: Mylan CEO says system is brokenVIDEO1:0801:08Mylan CEO: Fixed EpiPen, but system is brokenPower Lunch",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/taxpayers-may-have-overpaid-by-more-than-1-billion-for-mylans-epipen-senator-reveals.html

Mr. Baquet and Mr. Kahn said that the savings would be used to hire as many as 100 more reporters.The offer comes as The Times tries to transform from a legacy print operation to a more digitally focused newsroom. Reducing the layers of editing was one of the primary recommendations in an internal study issued in January, called the ""2020 Report,"" that serves as a blueprint for that transformation.The Times could turn to layoffs if there are not enough volunteers for buyouts, Mr. Baquet and Mr. Kahn said in the memo.In May, the Times Company  reported strong digital growth, including a 19 percent gain in digital advertising revenue.But those gains were not enough to offset an ongoing,  industrywide decline in print advertising, which has historically been the main revenue source for newspaper companies. Print advertising at The Times fell 18 percent in the most recent quarter, causing an overall advertising revenue decline of 7 percent.The company has increasingly relied on subscription revenue, which spiked as Americans closely followed the United States presidential election in November and the beginning of President Trump's term. The Times added 308,000 net digital-only subscribers in the most recent quarter, the most of any quarter in its history, leading to an 11 percent increase in circulation revenue.It was the second consecutive quarter of record-breaking subscriber growth, with the last three months of 2016 bringing 276,000 new digital-only subscriptions, more than the additions of 2013 and 2014 combined.

Administration sources told NBC News that Trump is leaning toward leaving the historic climate accord, but has not yet made a final decision. The president himself said in a Wednesday evening tweet that he would officially announce his decision on the accord from the White House Rose Garden at 3:00 p.m. Thursday.@realDonaldTrump: I will be announcing my decision on Paris Accord, Thursday at 3:00 P.M. The White House Rose Garden. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!The news that Trump had made his decision was reported by The Associated Press, Fox News and Axios. The administration is reportedly still deciding how it will exit the agreement. One option is to go through the established protocol for withdrawing from the accord, a process that would stretch out to the end of 2020, a White House official told Axios. Trump could also declare the Paris Agreement a legal treaty, which would require the Senate to approve it, the sources said.It is unclear whether Trump has the votes. Twenty-two of 52 Senate Republicans urged Trump to leave the accord in a letter last week.A final option is to withdraw from an international treaty, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which negotiated the Paris Agreement and other landmark climate deals.VIDEO1:5201:52Merkel: G-7 debate on climate was \xe2\x80\x98very unsatisfying\xe2\x80\x99Squawk Box EuropeMore than two decades of climate diplomacy produced the Paris Agreement in December 2015. The accord requires the 195 signatories \xe2\x80\x94 nearly every country in the world \xe2\x80\x94 to create national plans to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in a bid to mitigate the impact of climate change.Syria and Nicaragua are the only countries in the U.N. group that are not signatories.The treaty aims to prevent global temperatures from rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.Under President Barack Obama, the United States committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. The Obama administration also pledged $3 billion to a fund established to help developing nations meet their Paris Agreement goals, the largest donation announced to date.Trump and many of his allies have long dubbed the Paris Agreement a ""bad deal"" for America. They say it forces the United States to make immediate sacrifices that will hurt the economy, while other countries such as China are allowed to put off action until later.Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said Trump had ceded the United States' role in directing climate change efforts to countries like China and India.""Trump has abandoned the standard of American leadership, turned his back on the what the public and the market demand, and shamelessly disregarded the safety of our families just to let the fossil fuel industry eek out a few more dollars in profits,"" he said in a statement.GOP\xc2\xa0already undermined Paris AgreementTrump and Republicans have already begun chipping away at the Paris Agreement.In his first 100 days in office, Trump sought to undermine many of the Obama-era policies that would allow the United States to meet its commitments to the accord. He has set in motion the repeal of Obama's signature plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, teed up a potential easing of automobile fuel efficiency standards, and rescinded a host of other energy industry regulations and guidelines in a bid to increase fossil fuel production.President Donald Trump holds up an executive order on ""energy independence,"" eliminating Obama-era climate change regulations, during a signing ceremony at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) headquarters in Washington, U.S., March 28, 2017.Carlos Barria | ReutersA spending bill passed earlier this month to fund the federal government through September did not include any money for the fund that supports developing nations' treaty contributions.A number of large American companies were among those advocating for staying in the Paris Agreement, including U.S. energy giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron and their European peers Royal Dutch Shell and BP. The oil majors say the accord offers a framework for tackling global warming and gives the United States a role in steering the global response to climate change.To be sure, these companies are big players in natural gas development and stood to benefit from Obama-era regulations that have already expedited the retirement of some coal-fired plants and would likely continue that trend.But even some coal producers like Cloud Peak Energy and Peabody Energy argued the United States should remain a party in order to negotiate coal's future in the global energy mix.VIDEO3:0503:05US administration doesn't know what it wants to say about climate change: CEOStreet Signs EuropeWhite House schismThe issue had reportedly split the Trump administration into ""stay"" and ""leave"" camps. The two sides had quibbled over whether language in the text of the Paris Agreement allowed the United States to reduce its commitment.The stay camp included Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, as well as Trump's daughter and assistant Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, a White House senior advisor. They argued Trump has the authority to revise the country's contributions to make them less ambitious.The leave camp was led by White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt. They maintained that the Paris Agreement only allowed for an upward revision of a signatory's commitments and efforts to walk back U.S. goals could lead to legal challenges by environmentalists.The White House had signaled Trump would make a decision prior to meeting last weekend with leaders of G-7 nations, but later said the announcement would not come until after the summit.Trump telegraphed his expected decision at the meeting by refusing to endorse the Paris Agreement.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/trump-expected-to-pull-out-of-paris-climate-agreement.html

But is it illegal?,Politics,31-05-2017,"Jared Kushner, senior adviser to President Trump, listens to President Trump during a listening session with cyber security experts in the Roosevelt Room the White House in Washington.Jabin Botsford | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesDiplomatic back channels like the one President Trump's son-in-law set up with the Russian government are ""an appropriate part of diplomacy,"" the White House said Tuesday as it sought to douse a growing controversy over the Trump team's contacts with the rival power.But experts say the secret talks Jared Kushner sought with Russia would be different from back channels typically used by U.S. governments in the course of international relations.For one thing, Kushner held no formal position in the government at the time he first approached Russian officials at Trump Tower last December, before Trump was sworn in. And the discussions were apparently set up to operate without the knowledge of the U.S. government.More from  USA Today:President Trump expected to withdraw from Paris climate agreement What is covfefe? Not even Merriam-Webster can explain Donald Trump's tweetPortland train stabbing victim: 'I'm just trying to heal and recover'The existence of a secret back channel could raise a number of legal issues. The Logan Act, for example, prohibits citizens from conducting unauthorized diplomacy. There's also the Espionage Act, which prohibits the disclosure of classified information, and the Foreign Agent Registration Act, which prohibits anyone from acting as a secret agent of a foreign power.Whether the talks were illegal could depend on what Kushner aimed to accomplish in talks with Sergey Gorkov, an associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin and the head of the state-owned Vnesheconombank, a Russian bank subject to sanctions imposed by President Obama. Details of those meetings \xe2\x80\x94 which have become the latest focus of a sprawling FBI investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign \xe2\x80\x94 were reported last week by the Washington Post and The New York Times.Imagine that the back channel was so that Jared could get tips about where to buy the best vodka in the United States. If that's all that happened, it's not espionage. It's just really stupid.Stephen VladeckUniversity of Texas law professorBut press secretary Sean Spicer, addressing the issue in a press briefing for the first time Tuesday, declined to elaborate on the purpose of the Kushner-Gorkov back channel or what the president knew about it.""I'm not going to get into what the president did or did not discuss,"" he said. And while Spicer did not deny reports of the existence of a back channel, he said they were ""not substantiated by anything but anonymous sources that are so far being leaked out.""Kushner's ties to the Russian government  have caught the attention of federal investigators running the FBI investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election. One key question: Whether Kushner intended to undermine U.S. foreign policy.One source close to Kushner told the Associated Press that Kushner had spoken to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about opening up a line to Moscow about Syrian peace negotiations.That could violate the Logan Act. But that law, first passed by Congress in during the John Adams administration, has never been successfully enforced.""Imagine that the back channel was so that Jared could get tips about where to buy the best vodka in the United States. If that's all that happened, it's not espionage. It's just really stupid,"" said Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas law professor. ""I still think that we're light years away from either a Logan Act or an Espionage Act investigation.""Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, said last week there are legitimate reasons for quiet diplomacy. ""Generally speaking about back channel communications, what that allows you to do is to communicate in a discreet manner,"" he said.And indeed, there are often good reasons for government officials to have secret contacts with each other, said Anthony Wanis-St.John, an American University professor and author of  Back Channel Negotiation: Secrecy in the Middle East Peace Process. Those back channels allow two sides to negotiate without public posturing and internal opposition, decreasing the risks if talks fall through.The Kushner back channel is different, he said. ""In this case, we're talking about an unofficial representative of the Trump campaign and a banker with ties to the Kremlin,"" he said. ""Neither can bind their governments. There is a tinge of something that is less than transparent, and improper.""Because contacts first occurred during the transition, they exist in a sort of legal gray area: President Obama was still constitutionally in charge of foreign relations, but Trump was in the process of appointing his national security team in preparation to take over the job.The conversation about Kushner's back channel would likely be different if these discussions were taking place post-election, Wanis-St. John said, as even sitting presidents have set up back channels. Former president Richard Nixon did it with his National Security Adviser, Henry Kissinger, who often left the Secretary of State out of the loop on his contacts with the Russians.Still, any kind of secret discussion can risks consequences, he said.

251,Fed officials have been dipping their toes into the political waters,Economy,31-05-2017,"VIDEO1:4401:44Is apolitical Fed sending White House subtle signals? Squawk BoxOfficially, the Federal Reserve is trying to stay out of the political debate in Washington over tax reform and other fiscal measures.But with so much on the line for the economy, and with the outlook for fiscal policy growing more unclear, Fed officials in practice have been unable to stay mum. In interviews, speeches and even official documents, the Fed has increasingly been weighing in.The minutes of the May policy meeting noted that, ""A number of participants pointed out that clarification of prospective fiscal and other policy changes would remove one source of uncertainty for the economic outlook."" That's Fedspeak for it's hard to forecast when you don't know what policies will be and we'd prefer if you got on with it.The minutes also say Fed members ""view the possibility of expansionary fiscal policy changes in the United States as posing upside risks to their forecasts for U.S. economic growth."" Translation: If you do it, it could be good.About half of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee have upgraded their forecasts in anticipation of those policies. Many Fed officials, like many economists, support tax reform if for no other reason that it's doctrine in the economics world that taxes distort decision making. Any kind of reform that reduces those distortions \xe2\x80\x94 for example by reducing write-offs or simplifying the code \xe2\x80\x94 will be seen as a positive for growth. Deregulation gets good reviews for similar reasons.But many Fed members have made no secret that they see the full package of President Donald Trump's economic proposals as a potential mixed bag, in part because it runs afoul of other basic tenets of economics.VIDEO1:1401:14Fed: Slower growth, less optimism in some regionsPower LunchCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester is concerned about immigration reform. She said in a recent speech that immigrants make up 16 percent of the US workforce.""Given U.S. demographics, immigrants will become an increasingly important source of labor supply for the U.S.,"" she said. ""This suggests that a well-thought-out immigration policy that attracts labor to the U.S. is also a necessary ingredient to support longer-run growth."" Translation: You need workers to grow the economy and you can't do that if you keep workers out.Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan singles out health care reform as a potential negative if it reduces the number of insured Americans. That, in turn, could reduce spending and increase savings, he said. ""The reality is, some of the policies being discussed will help GDP: regulatory review, if it's thoughtfully done, potentially infrastructure spending if it's thoughtfully done, could help,"" Kaplan told CNBC in an interview Tuesday. ""But some of them could hurt GDP growth.""Trade is another area of concern.In a CNBC interview in March, Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer noted that free trade ""worked spectacularly for China (and) it worked for us.""""We've been able to buy many, many things that we wouldn't have been able to make had it all been up to us,"" Fischer said. ""So we benefit from that as well. \xe2\x80\xa6 I'd be concerned if that basic model is overturned.""Doubts about tax cutsThere's even concern over policies which Fed officials generally agree are positive. Deregulation gets high marks from the Fed, but the May minutes show that several members ""expressed concerns that a possible easing of regulatory standards could increase risks to financial stability.""And tax cuts and tax reform may be highly regarded, but Fed officials also want to know how they are paid for.""If it's a tax cut financed by increase in the deficit, my concern is that may give a short-term bump to GDP growth but not a sustainable bump,"" Kaplan said. ""We'll have higher debt-to-GDP and I think that would be negative to economic growth.""Fed Governor Lael Brainard is skeptical that so-called supply side tax cuts will do much to boost supply and instead increase ""demand at a time when the economy could be at full employment.""The unstated implication is that tax cuts could drive inflation higher and force the Fed to respond with additional rate hikes. There is also widespread skepticism that President Trump's goal of hitting 3 percent is possible.Fed Chair Janet Yellen has remained on the sidelines of much of the debate, though she did warn in a February testimony about the possible deficit implications of tax cuts. She has consistently urged Congress and the Administration to pursue ""policies that would boost productivity growth and raise the economy's so-called speed limit or potential to grow"" but not been very specific about what would do that. She has mentioned education and infrastructure spending as two policies that could help.The trouble is that, while much Fed support and criticism of the president's economic policies come from generally held beliefs in economics, there isn't a single set of policy tools that all agree would boost productivity.\xe2\x80\x94With additional reporting by CNBC's Elizabeth SchulzeWATCH: Economists increasingly skeptical Trump's plans will generate 3 percent growth.VIDEO5:0205:02Budget sparks debate about White House's 3-percent growth targetPower Lunch",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/fed-officials-have-been-dipping-their-toes-into-the-political-waters.html
252,Pop up goes the retail scene as store vacancies rise,Retail,31-05-2017,"Samantha, left, and Morgan Elias, twin sisters who founded Vintage Twin, a pop-up secondhand clothing company, at one of their pop-up stores in New York, May 25, 2017.Dolly Faibyshev | The New York TimesAs traditional retail stores close and vacancies mount, landlords across the country appear newly receptive to leases as short as a week, eschewing the typical 10-year time frame, even in locations that once shunned limited stays.The upswing in pop-up stores, as the short-term placements are called, is playing out in all sorts of ways, and in all sorts of places \xe2\x80\x94 including dark malls, former grocery stores and shuttered art galleries, according to real estate brokers, landlords and tenants.For retailers, the stores can offer lower rents and far less commitment. For the landlords, the reason is just as clear: A short-term tenant is better than no tenant at all.More from New York Times:India's bad debt is looking better to investorsEven as wind power rises, it falls under a political cloudChina detains activist who worked at manufacturer of Ivanka Trump shoes""Landlords have their backs against the wall right now,"" said Samantha Elias, the co-founder of the Vintage Twin, a secondhand clothing company whose stores frequently pop up in Manhattan. ""I tell them that some money is better than no money, and I promise not to bother you.""The rise in pop-up stores is adding another element of change to a retail industry facing upheaval from profound shifts in consumer habits and powerful new competitors, especially online. In the past, short-term tenants focused on holidays like Halloween: Costumes were hot items in October, but sales evaporated once the calendar turned to November.But today, the products go far beyond monster masks, to skin serums, designer handbags and crystal champagne flutes, as brands see pop-ups as an opportunity for quick public exposure or as a possible steppingstone to something bigger. And while some landlords continue to shun short-term deals \xe2\x80\x94 arguing that the rents, which are generally below market rate, do not justify the trouble and cost involved with preparing a space \xe2\x80\x94 they are quickly dwindling in number.""The trend has become more prevalent in the last year or so,"" said Karen Bellantoni, a vice chairwoman of RKF, a retail-focused national brokerage firm.RKF does not specifically track pop-ups, which is also the case with other major firms. But the fleeting boutiques are an increasingly bigger part of agents' business, including in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas and New York. ""We're definitely seeing landlords looking for them,"" Ms. Bellantoni added.Ms. Elias said she had also seen a change. In 2012, when she started looking for physical stores to augment her online business, she had to cold-call landlords directly, she said, because ""brokers had never heard of pop-ups.""Landlords are finally coming around, she said, but they may have no choice, as stores continue to go out of business.Ms. Elias added that ""it must be really scary right now"" for owners in SoHo, where most of her pop-ups have been.But the new stores can cause landlords to lose money, said Stephen Summers, the managing director of Highland Park Village, an upscale shopping center near Dallas that is in the midst of a multiyear renovation.In late 2014, Mr. Summers installed Goop, an online retailer founded by Gwyneth Paltrow, for a four-week run in a former grocery store at his historic red-tile-roof complex, a widely copied model for the 20th-century shopping center.Because the store, at 20,000 square feet, was considered too large for Goop's needs, Mr. Summers had to construct a more intimate 1,500-square-foot berth, including dressing rooms. That renovation ultimately caused the deal to be unprofitable, he said, even though Goop drew so many customers that there were lines around the block.But Mr. Summers said he was glad to have a relationship with the company. Goop, which has popped up in multiple spots, is planning to open permanent locations, and Mr. Summers plans to court the company. ""Pop-ups are a responsible way to grow,"" he said.Like Goop, other web-born businesses are seeking a bricks-and-mortar presence as well, aware that most shopping is still done offline, and are turning to pop-ups to get their start.For instance, Daniel Wellington, a six-year-old watch company with a heavy social media presence, has been selling its timepieces in part through department stores like Bloomingdale's and small jewelry shops. But in November 2015, it opened its first temporary store in the East Village of Manhattan. A year later, it opened one in nearby SoHo for two months. Because that location was a success, Wellington signed a more permanent six-year lease for the same space, said Ola Melin, a company spokesman.Wellington also has pop-ups in Boston, Miami and Honolulu, among other cities, Mr. Melin said.In SoHo, where pop-ups are especially popular, the range in rents can be significant. Long-term tenants have been paying in some cases up to $150,000 a month, brokers and tenants say. But pop-ups can get deals for $25,000 a month. They generally pay all their rent upfront and agree to leave with a few days' notice if a longer-term tenant is signed.While some buildings may be hard to get into, others seem more inviting, like 543 Broadway. That is where Vintage Twin \xe2\x80\x94 which is owned by Ms. Elias and her twin sister, Morgan \xe2\x80\x94 has been set up since April, and which bustled with shoppers on a recent weekday afternoon. A tie-dyed Grateful Dead concert T-shirt from the 1990s was $244.Several pop-ups have set up camp at the address, a Beaux-Arts edifice, since Carlo Pazolini, a shoes and accessories store, closed in 2015 after a four-year stay.""To keep the neighborhood alive and vibrant, you need to have retailers occupying space, especially in today's day and age,"" said Jared Epstein, a principal of Aurora Capital Associates, the building's landlord.Similarly, last year, Aurora installed the Broadway Market Company, a pop-up with various vendors who sell handbags, jewelry and stationery, in a vacant building it owns nearby. Its lease is expected to run about 18 months.Likewise, an Aurora-owned building in SoHo in May welcomed Artists and Fleas, another market with tables and racks from different vendors, which replaced a 10,000-square-foot Armani Exchange store that closed in March. Artists and Fleas has committed to a one-year lease, Mr. Epstein said.Swooping in to capitalize on the rash of empty stores in New York and elsewhere are some new brokerage-type businesses, which charge fees to landlords as brokers do and also sometimes market spaces concurrently with other agents.Examples include Space in the Raw, a two-year-old firm that for about a month last fall joined Taco Bell with Sony PlayStation for a SoHo pop-up, in its first New York retail deal.There is also Appear Here, a four-year-old British company that opened a New York office in April. Since then, it has found homes for dozens of pop-ups, said Ross Bailey, its chief executive, including Misbhv, an apparel company, on East 34th Street, in a part of Midtown where empty stores are evident.Mr. Bailey says that contrary to popular belief, young adults want to touch what they buy and also enjoy the physical shopping experience. Besides, ""it would be a sad world if everybody was staying at home looking at screens,"" he said. This month, Appear Here raised nearly $13 million in venture capital, bringing its total in raised funds to about $21 million.But in a way, pop-ups, despite their growing ubiquity, are like Band-Aids on deep wounds when it comes to the problem of stubborn vacancy rates, brokers say.""Rents are just too high, and it's just too cost-prohibitive to be here,"" said David Barreto, the founder of Cast Iron Real Estate in SoHo and someone who encourages landlords to do what it takes to fill spaces. ""It's really just sad.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/pop-up-goes-the-retail-scene-as-store-vacancies-rise.html

Its latest incarnation is yet to be tested on animals or people, though the researchers involved hope that the drug will make it to market within five years.The study was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Boger told CNBC via e-mail that the drug is ""not only more potent, but it displays more durable antimicrobial activity.""

256,The GOP Congressional agenda is lagging five months in,Politics,31-05-2017,"Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wis., conducts his weekly news conference in the Capitol Visitor Center on May 25, 2017.Tom Williams | CQ Roll Call | Getty ImagesCongressional Republicans began the year with a long and ambitious list of priorities that had been sidelined during eight years of President Barack Obama's tenure. Five months in, the GOP policy agenda is lagging far behind their expectations. A slower-than-anticipated process of confirming President Donald Trump's nominees, the bruising effort to pass a health-care reform plan in the House and the ongoing controversy coming from the White House over expanding investigations into Russia have slowed any momentum the party had coming out of last year's election.And time is not on their side. Congress has just seven weeks of work before the beginning of August when they take five weeks off to return to their districts. The fall legislative agenda will be filled with the battle over funding the government before the new fiscal year on October 1 \xe2\x80\x94 the one thing on their agenda that Congress is Constitutionally tasked with doing. And January begins another critical election year for lawmakers, making tough legislation even more difficult to pass.More from NBC News:President Trump scolds Kathy Griffin: She 'should be ashamed'Trump tariffs could trigger job losses in Trump countryTrump lawyer Cohen says he'll testify if subpoenaed by Congress in Russia probeWith Congress out for the rest of this week, the president registered his opinion on the slow pace of progress, advocating for a change in Senate rules that would allow legislation such as tax reform and health care to pass with a simple majority.@realdonaldtrump:  The U.S. Senate should switch to 51 votes, immediately, and get Healthcare and TAX CUTS approved, fast and easy. Dems would do it, no doubt!Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has repeatedly said he's not interested in changing the Senate rules from the 60-vote threshold to pass legislation to a 51-vote majority. In addition, the two pieces of legislation Trump cited are attached to a rarely used legislative maneuver called reconciliation that already allows for those bills to pass with a simple majority.As Congress heads into the summer months, here's a progress report on the GOP agenda:Repeal of ObamacareStatus Update: Despite promises from candidate Trump that he would repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act on his first day in office, the process has taken much longer. After fits and starts, the House has passed a bill that would reform the nation's health care system. The Senate is currently at work on taking that legislation and altering it but it's not happening rapidly.Outlook: While GOP senators repeatedly say they are putting no timeline on their effort, the reality is they must pass it before they leave town for their August recess in order to time for the House to vote on the measure again \xe2\x80\x94 as required by Congressional rules \xe2\x80\x94 and that must happen before the end of the fiscal year or else the vehicle to pass the measure, known as reconciliation, expires.Tax reformStatus Update: Trump has released a one-page outline on his broad vision for tax reform without specifics. Republican leaders in the House and the heads of relevant committees have been meeting with Trump adviser Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to discuss details of an overhaul of business and individual taxes. While the work is being done behind the scenes, Republicans on the Hill admit that tax reform will not move forward until health care is done.Outlook: In addition to timing, there's disagreement between House and Senate Republicans on elements of tax reform. House Speaker Paul Ryan is pushing for a new corporate tax called the border adjustment tax, which would impose a tax on any product made overseas and coming into the U.S. Senate Republicans soundly reject the idea, saying that it would lead to a trade war. The administration has given mixed signals on the border adjustment tax.The difficulty passing health care is slowing the momentum. Revamping the entire tax code is politically risky and with 2018 looming, it becomes more difficult. If tax reform doesn't pass this year, it's likely that comprehensive tax reform would be pared down to be a tax-cut bill.Dodd-FrankStatus Update: Republicans have had their eye on either repealing the comprehensive Wall Street regulation legislation signed into law in 2010, or severely gutting it. A House Committee passed the Financial Choice Act out of committee, which is the first step in advancing legislation. The House could vote on it as early as next week.Outlook: The Senate is less motivated to pass a repeal of the financial oversight legislation. The Senate committee has ""no plans"" to take up the House bill as of now, according to a Senate aide. Instead, the Senate is more interested in a broad-based bipartisan bill that focuses on economic growth and could include some financial regulation reform.InfrastructureStatus Update: This was never one of Congressional Republicans' priorities, but it was a top agenda item of the president. Congress has done little work on an infrastructure bill. In his budget, Trump outlined some broad strokes about an infrastructure plan that included $200 billion worth of federal funding.Outlook: With priorities shared by both Trump and Congress taking longer than anticipated, any movement on infrastructure will be almost entirely up to the White House. And amidst almost daily developments in the Russian investigations, spearheading a massive infrastructure bill beyond broad strokes will be difficult.Appropriations BillsStatus Update: Congress is tasked with passing 12 funding bills before October 1. The House must pass the funding bills first before they are sent to the Senate. The House has yet to pass one of the appropriations bill.Outlook: The appropriations process is often messy. Congress in recent years has rarely finished its work on time and has had to pass short-term spending bills that keep the government open until the House and Senate hash out the details of what it wants to fund or de-fund in the next fiscal year. Sometimes there's a government shutdown if no agreement can be reached. We're still months away from October 1, which in Washington, is an eternity, but the closer that date gets, the more Congress will scramble.Regulatory reformStatus Update: This is arguably the biggest success in the GOP agenda thus far. Republicans want to roll back regulations passed during President Obama's term through executive order that they said stifled economic growth. Republicans passed 14 measures that undo Obama regulations, including a measure that protected waterways from coal mining runoff, a Dodd-Frank measure that forced oil and gas companies disclose information related to foreign governments, and a measure that banned states from drug testing unemployment insurance recipients.A Senate Republican assessment says that the reduction of the regulations will ""save taxpayers at least $3.7 billion and 4.2 million hours of paperwork.""Outlook: The mechanism that Congress used to roll back the regulations has now expired. While Republicans will continue to reduce regulations throughout the economy, it will have to be done through the normal legislative procedure.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/the-gop-congressional-agenda-is-lagging-five-months-in.html
257,Trump is having a hard time hiring people \xe2\x80\x94 and constant turmoil doesn't help,Politics,31-05-2017,"VIDEO0:2600:26Richard LeFrak: Trump enjoys a little bit of chaosSquawk BoxPresident Donald Trump is struggling to fill hundreds of government jobs, and the task isn't getting any easier in a hectic White House. Just over four months into his administration, Trump has lagged far behind recent administrations in getting executive branch officials confirmed by the Senate \xe2\x80\x94 or even nominating anyone for the jobs. Those include critical positions, such as deputy and assistant Cabinet secretaries, some of whom would presumably help craft the president's ambitious policy agenda.  Trump is early in his first term and has time to fill out the government. But in a lean White House pushing for a flurry of legislative activity and shadowed by an FBI probe, getting skilled individuals nominated and confirmed could prove difficult, according to people who follow the presidential appointment process. ""Once you fall behind, it's very hard to catch up ... there are a lot of competing priorities. The urgent can crowd out the important. There are things to deal with like the Russia investigation and health care reform,"" said Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that tracks the pace of presidential nominations. The White House did not immediately respond to a request to comment on this story.Falling behind\xc2\xa0As of Wednesday morning, the president had formally nominated only 110 people to about 1,200 positions that require Senate confirmation, with 40 appointees confirmed, according to the Partnership for Public Service. He lags far behind the pace set by Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush, who had all seen at least twice as many appointees confirmed by May 31 of their first terms. ""Prior presidents haven't done this [appointment process] well, and Trump is doing worse than they did,"" Stier said.In the group of 559 jobs that the Partnership for Public Service classifies as higher priority Trump has nominated 63 people and seen 39 of those confirmed.Those figures do not include the more than 100 federal court vacancies Trump is supposed to fill. Trump announced a group of 10 nominees to those seats early this month and is expected to choose more judges in the coming months. Several factors have contributed to Trump's slower pace filling out positions, according to Anne O'Connell, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has studied the presidential appointment process. Some of the struggles relate to ""self-harm,"" such as not taking enough time to vet nominees who later withdrew or ruling out candidates who made critical statements about Trump in the election, she said. Government hiring has also put constraints on Trump that the private sector did not when he worked as a businessman, O'Connell said. Trump also never held elected office. A lack of executive branch experience, in particular, has slowed presidents who did not previously serve there, she said. O'Connell noted, however, that Trump has picked up the pace of appointments since his 100th day in office in April. Not willing to ""take the leap""\xc2\xa0Trump faces another major problem in finding appointees: Candidates are reluctant to take the jobs.The White House is trying to distance itself from the FBI's investigation into Russian interference with the U.S. 2016 election and possible ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow. Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey and questions about his motives have only complicated matters for his top advisors, many of whom are balancing a slew of responsibilities.That's an environment many top candidates hesitate to enter, experts said. Some candidates who would normally see White House jobs as a gem on their resumes no longer do.  VIDEO1:5201:52Justice Dept. names Mueller as special counsel in Russia probePower Lunch""They won't be able to attract the most talented people in Washington, D.C. Nobody in their right mind would jump into this White House at this point. I don't think it's a very positive work environment right now for anybody to take the leap here,"" said Steven Billet, director of the master's program in legislative affairs at George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management. A New York Times report Tuesday said the White House has had difficulty finding a replacement for recently departed communications director Michael Dubke. The FBI probe ""coupled with the president's habit of undercutting his staff"" have ""driven away candidates for West Wing jobs that normally would be among the most coveted in American politics,"" the newspaper reported. The White House's troubles make ""what was already really hard even harder,"" said Stier from the Partnership for Public Service. In another recent example, Goldman Sachs executive Jim Donovan, the nominee for the No. 2 spot at the Treasury Department, dropped out of contention this month. Donovan cited a desire to focus on his family. Trump has not announced a new nominee. The Republican-controlled Senate, which confirms Trump's appointments, also faces a packed legislative schedule, leaving it less time to take up nominations. This year, the chamber will aim to craft plans to overhaul the American health care and tax systems, pass an appropriations bill and raise the federal debt limit. On top of that, Democrats emboldened by resistance to Trump have worked to delay many of his nominees, though their ability to do so is limited. Where it really matters\xc2\xa0Stier and Billet note that a lack of appointments could affect a range of policy decisions, including Trump's big-ticket goals. For example, career officials at the Treasury Department are working on tax policy. But having another high-level official working with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on tax reform could bring new insight or policy ideas that the administration currently lacks. ""Decisions don't get made as well, as quickly or as effectively without a presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed, person in place,"" Stier said. Billet noted that the debut of Trump's tax plan in April came in the form of a one-page summary. Congress ""needs something more than that"" if the White House ""wants to play a leading role"" in the tax legislation that lawmakers eventually take up, Billet said. Berkeley's O'Connell notes that institutions like the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Nuclear Regulatory Commission also suffer without appointees.

258,Buying sterling might be the wrong option around a UK election,UK Election 2017,31-05-2017,"If you are undecided about how to trade the British pound around the upcoming general election, history shows you should stay away from it.Using data analytics platform Kensho, CNBC looked at how sterling performed before and after a U.K. general election and it concluded that the average return tends to be negative.Buying sterling on the trading day after the election result and selling it 30 days after gave an average return of only 0.32 percent.Buying sterling one trading day before and selling it three days after gave an average return of -0.56 percent.Similarly, if someone bought sterling five days before the election day and sold it five trading days after, the average return was -1.05 percent.""Due to the volatility that can be caused by major political events such as elections, I think it is the case that many investors avoid currency trading close to such an event with only speculators choosing to be involved close to the date of a ballot,"" Jane Foley, Rabobank's strategist responsible for the G-10 currencies, told CNBC via email.She noted that each election has a different backdrop which influences trading. Perhaps the main influencing factor this June 8 is the U.K.'s departure from the European Union.Meanwhile, Roger Hallam, currency chief information officer at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNBC: ""We believe that the upcoming U.K. general election will allow the prime minister to consolidate and grow her majority, while providing better scope for transitional arrangements so that the probability of a 'cliff' exit becomes lower \xe2\x80\x93which reduces the severe tail-risks for sterling.""""But assuming the U.K. pursues a reasonably hard Brexit approach, (which means that most current links with the EU would be lost) the period will certainly be challenging from an economic and capital flows perspective.

260,Trump\xe2\x80\x99s use of private cellphone raises security concerns,White House,30-05-2017,"President Donald Trump has been handing out his cellphone number to world leaders and urging them to call him directly, an unusual invitation that breaks diplomatic protocol and is raising concerns about the security and secrecy of the U.S. commander in chief's communications.Trump has urged leaders of Canada and Mexico to reach him on his cellphone, according to former and current U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the practice. Of the two, only Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has taken advantage of the offer so far, the officials said.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (L) and U.S. President Donald Trump talk as they arrive for a family photo, during the G7 Summit in Taormina, Sicily, Italy, May 26, 2017.Philippe Wojazer | ReutersTrump also exchanged numbers with French President Emmanuel Macron when the two spoke immediately following Macron's victory earlier this month, according to a French official, who would not comment on whether Macron intended to use the line.All the officials demanded anonymity because they were not authorized to reveal the conversations. Neither the White House nor Trudeau's office responded to requests for comment.The notion of world leaders calling each other up via cellphone may seem unremarkable in the modern, mobile world. But in the diplomatic arena, where leader-to-leader calls are highly orchestrated affairs, it is another notable breach of protocol for a president who has expressed distrust of official channels. The formalities and discipline of diplomacy have been a rough fit for Trump \xe2\x80\x94 who, before taking office, was long easily accessible by cellphone and viewed himself as freewheeling, impulsive dealmaker.Presidents generally place calls on one of several secure phone lines, including those in the White House Situation Room, the Oval Office or the presidential limousine. Even if Trump uses his government-issued cellphone, his calls are vulnerable to eavesdropping, particularly from foreign governments, national security experts say.""If you are speaking on an open line, then it's an open line, meaning those who have the ability to monitor those conversations are doing so,"" said Derek Chollet, a former Pentagon adviser and National Security Council official now at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.VIDEO0:5200:52Congressional Russia probe now includes Trump lawyer Michael CohenNews VideosA president ""doesn't carry with him a secure phone,"" Chollet said. ""If someone is trying to spy on you, then everything you're saying, you have to presume that others are listening to it.""The caution is warranted even when dealing with allies. As German Chancellor Angela Merkel's learned in 2013, when a dump of American secrets leaked by Edward Snowden revealed the U.S. was monitoring her cellphone, good relations don't prevent some spycraft between friends.""If you are Macron or the leader of any country and you get the cellphone number of the president of the United States, it's reasonable to assume that they'd hand it right over to their intel service,"" said Ashley Deeks, a law professor at the University of Virginia who formerly served as the assistant legal adviser for political-military affairs in the U.S. State Department.The practice opens Trump up to charges of hypocrisy. Throughout last year's presidential campaign, he lambasted Democratic rival Hillary Clinton for using a private email server while she was secretary of state, insisting she should not be given access to classified information because she would leave it vulnerable to foreign foes.Presidents' phone calls with world leaders often involve considerable advance planning. State Department and National Security Council officials typically prepare scripted talking points and background on the leader on the other end of the line. Often an informal transcript of the call is made and circulated among a select group \xe2\x80\x94 sometimes a small clutch of aides, sometimes a broader group of foreign policy officials. Those records are preserved and archived.The White House did not respond to questions on whether the president is keeping records of any less-formal calls with world leaders.Trump's White House is already facing scrutiny for apparent efforts to work outside usual diplomatic channels.VIDEO1:0001:00Trump tells NATO allies they need to spend more on defenseDigital OriginalThe administration has been fending off questions about a senior aide's attempt to set up a secret back channel of communication with Moscow in the weeks before Trump was took office. White House adviser Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, met in December with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. and discussed whether a secret line of communication could be used to facilitate sensitive policy discussions about the conflict in Syria, according to a person familiar with the talks. The person demanded anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss the sensitive conversation by name.The White House has said such back channel communications are useful and discreet.Trump has struggled more than most recent presidents to keep his conversations with world leaders private. His remarks to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Russian diplomats have all leaked, presumably after notes of the conversations were circulated by national security officials.It was unclear whether an impromptu, informal call with a foreign leader would be logged and archived. The Presidential Records Act of 1981, passed in response to the Watergate scandal, requires that the president and his staff preserve all records related to the office. In 2014, the act was amended to include personal emails.VIDEO1:2401:24Focus turns to Jared Kushner after Trump's overseas tripSquawk BoxBut the law contains ""blind spots"" \xe2\x80\x94 namely, record-keeping for direct cellphone communications, said Jonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University Law School, who specializes in public interest and national security law.Under Barack Obama, the first cellphone-toting president, worries about cyber intrusions \xe2\x80\x94 particularly by foreign governments \xe2\x80\x94 pulled the president's devices deep into the security bubble. Many of the functions on Obama's BlackBerry were blocked, and a very small handful of people had his phone number or email address, according to former aides.""Government sometimes looks like a big bureaucracy that has stupid rules, but a lot of these things are in place for very good reasons and they've been around for a while and determine the most effective way to do business in the foreign policy sphere,"" said Deeks.

But Bezos has been helpful in the sense that ""he could bring a sense of growth, a huge knowledge of technology, and a real understanding of consumer behavior"" as the Post moves away from its print product and more toward digital products.Clinton, a former U.S. senator and first lady, said she thought almost a year ago that Russia might be interfering in the election, but she said she couldn't get the press to cover it. Today, an investigation is underway about the issue.Meanwhile, platforms like Twitter have been ""victimized"" by the spread of false information, Clinton said. She urged Twitter users to differentiate between threats and diversions, or ""chasing rabbits"" down proverbial rabbit holes. Clinton tossed barbs at her former rival, President Donald Trump, who has been known to announce policy stances on Twitter.Still, Clinton said platforms like Facebook need to get better at curating news. The company has aggressively worked toward curbing misuse on its platform, including ""false amplifiers"" of political stances.""I have a lot of sympathy for the people making these decisions,"" Clinton said of executives at places like Facebook and Twitter.

263,4 financial gifts for grads that are smarter than cash,College Game Plan ,31-05-2017,"Don't be so quick to hand your favorite high school or college grad a congratulatory card with cash. Other financial gifts can have a bigger impact.More than a third of consumers  will buy gifts for a graduate this year, according to the National Retail Federation \xe2\x80\x94 which projects total spending at a record $5.6 billion. Spending among consumers age 18 to 24 averages roughly $78 for such a gift, they found, while ""parent-age"" givers age 45 to 54 give an average $120, and ""the grandparent bracket"" of those age 65 and older, $112.Cash is king, with 52.8 percent of givers citing it as a planned gift. Another third of consumers expect to offer a gift card.Many new grads have big plans for any gifts of money they receive, including saving it (23.8 percent), investing it (19.2 percent) and using it to pay down student loans (18.7 percent), according to a survey from investing app Stash. The company polled 214 of its users who are part of the Class of 2017.VIDEO1:1701:17How to deal with college debtCollege Game Plan The right gift could help a grad meet those aims, or otherwise get a leg up financially, said certified financial planner David Demming, president of Demming Financial Services Corp. in Aurora, Ohio.""What you want is to set a good example, something they can build on,"" he said.Financial advisors say these four gifts could benefit a new grad more than cash.Retirement contributionsOffering to help fund a Roth IRA can be an especially valuable gift, said certified financial planner George Padula, principal at Modera Wealth Management in Boston. Those contributions grow tax free and can be withdrawn tax free in retirement, and an early start gives the money decades to compound. Hero Images | Getty ImagesRather than offering a flat gift, consider matching your grad's contributions up to a set amount over several years, Padula said.""It creates good savings habits as a new graduate going into the workforce,"" he said.InvestmentsIf you're in a higher tax bracket, gifting appreciated stocks can help you avoid capital gains taxes, said certified financial planner Frani Feit, managing director for Tradition Capital Management in Summit, New Jersey.""Typically, young graduates will be in a lower tax bracket than their gifter, so if the stock was sold, the assumed capital gains would be taxed at a lower rate,"" she said. ""Or the recipient could hold the stock, which might encourage investment research and a future interest in the stock market.""Other ways to gift investments include funding a new brokerage account, or purchasing gift cards that can be redeemed for shares, via a site like Stockpile.Student loan paymentsOffering extra help during the six-month grace period after graduation can cut interest accrued, resulting in lower monthly payments or a faster payoff for a new grad. If you want to make sure the money goes toward loans, there are gift cards like GiftofCollege.com that can be redeemed directly into a student loan account.Or you might split up your gift into installments, helping a new grad ease into juggling student loan repayment as part of their overall budget, Feit said.Wealthier individuals might consider paying off one or more of the loans in full, said Demming. That could be an outright gift, or a loan to the grad at a much lower interest rate, he said \xe2\x80\x94 essentially gifting them a shorter payoff time and less paid in interest.Help with billsThink about gifts that could help a new grad fill in financial gaps.For example, you might cover their health insurance, auto insurance or disability insurance for a set period, said certified financial planner Carolyn McClanahan, director of financial planning for Life Planning Partners in Jacksonville, Florida. That can smooth the transition from being on a parent's policy, she said, and help ensure they're protected.If you want to buy gift cards, think about ones that could help make a new grad's life easier, Feit said. Look for a card that can lighten the burden of ongoing expenses (like a cellphone bill) or an upcoming expense (like furniture for that new apartment).""Or how about an HBO gift card so the grad can enjoy some entertainment while watching the rest of his or her graduation money grow?"" she said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/4-financial-gifts-for-grads-that-are-smarter-than-cash.html

At the time the note was published, bitcoin was trading at around $754, so the target price represented a 165 percent rise. Bitcoin hit $2,000 on May 20.But now, Kay Van-Petersen, the analyst behind the call, is looking long term and sees a big rise ahead for bitcoin.How will bitcoin hit $100,000Here's how he came up with his price target in 10 years.Van-Petersen is assuming cryptocurrencies in general \xe2\x80\x93 not just bitcoin \xe2\x80\x93 will account for 10 percent of the average daily volumes (ADV) of fiat currency trade in 10 years. Foreign exchange ADV currently stands at just over $5 trillion, according to the Bank for International Settlements.Ten percent of $5 trillion is $500 billion. This is the ADV that cryptocurrencies could have. Bitcoin will account for 35 percent of that market share, which would that $175 billion of the $500 billion figure, he said. This would mean that $175 billion worth of bitcoin would be traded every dayA member of bitcoin trading club poses with bitcoin medals at the club's meeting in Tokyo.Yoshikazu Tsuno | AFP | Getty ImagesAlso, Van-Petersen then implies that bitcoin's market capitalization would be ten times the average daily volume, giving a figure of $1.75 trillion for the market cap. The current figure is around $37.8 billion, according to data from industry website CoinDesk.Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million which is expected to be reached by the year 2140. In 10 years, the analyst thinks that there will be 17 million bitcoin in circulation, up from the current 16.3 million figure.If the potential 17 million of bitcoins in supply is divided by the $1.75 trillion market cap estimate, then each bitcoin would be worth just over $100,000.Bitcoin 'not a fad'Van-Petersen \xe2\x80\x93 who owns bitcoin \xe2\x80\x93 emphasizes that this is a rough calculation but that his growth predictions could be ""conservative"" given that in the year 2013 alone, bitcoin's price grew over 5,000 percent. The analyst said that cryptocurrencies will survive in the long run.""This is not a fad, cryptocurrencies are here to stay,"" Van-Petersen told CNBC in a phone interview.""There will emerge two to three main ones. Bitcoin will be one of those. And the reason is the first-mover advantage, the scale and the pioneering.""VIDEO0:3500:35Bitcoin surges 11% to all-time high above $2,700; Has now doubled in MayNews VideosVan-Petersen's views are not the official view of Saxo Bank, the analyst said. Bitcoin's bad reputationThe bitcoin industry has had its fair share of problems and reputational damage. The digital currency has often had an image of being used for illegal means such as buying drugs online. The collapse of Mt.Gox in 2014, once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, is still fresh in the minds of users. Some members of the exchange are still waiting for compensation.More recent issues include some exchanges not allowing people to withdraw their money in fiat currency. On top of this, the view of bitcoin as a currency for criminals is still prevalent after the major WannaCry ransomware cyberattack saw hackers lock peoples' files and ask for bitcoin in exchange to unlock them. Still, Van-Petersen says that the industry is still extremely young and big improvements will come. A few factors will boost bitcoin adoption including better wallets, easier methods to buy the digital currency, use of it for money transfers in areas like remittances, as well as citizens of countries with volatile economies and currencies buying it.""Volumes are going up, volatility is going down. A lot of people talk about the volatility, but if you are in Zimbabwe or Venezuela, this volatility is nothing. This is the interesting thing to me. I think in the West, a lot of people view it is as speculative, but emerging markets will get it, their needs will be different,"" Van-Petersen added.While Van-Petersen is offering one way to value bitcoin in the future, others say that there are other factors to take into consideration.""It's one way of slicing the pie to try and predict future prices which always relies on a lot of assumptions,"" Charlie Hayter, CEO of industry website CryptoCompare, told CNBC by email.""Equating volumes to price value is one method of attempting a valuation, but it doesn't take into account the fundamentals of the ecosystem.""The fundamentals of what bitcoin is capable of from a technical point of view and how regulation is molded around its use will determine its value too, Hayter added.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/bitcoin-price-forecast-hit-100000-in-10-years.html

270,Former FBI Director Comey will testify June 8 in first public comments since Trump fired him,Politics,01-06-2017,"VIDEO2:3302:33Comey to testify to Senate panel June 8 Halftime ReportFormer FBI Director James Comey will appear before a Senate panel on June 8 in his first public testimony since President Donald Trump fired him. Comey will speak to an open hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee followed by a closed session, the committee announced Thursday. The hearing is part of the panel's probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election and any possible ties between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. Comey was abruptly fired last month while overseeing the FBI's own investigation of alleged Russian interference. The former FBI chief will certainly be asked about his reported conversations with Trump and any efforts the president made to interfere with the probe. Robert Mueller, who was FBI director before Comey, is now overseeing the probe as a special counsel. It is not yet clear how much Comey will say about his conversations with Trump or an alleged memo in which Comey reportedly says the president asked him to back off the investigation into ex-national security advisor Michael Flynn. The White House has given shifting explanations about Trump's motives for firing Comey. The administration initially said Trump acted on the Justice Department's recommendation, though Trump himself later said he would have fired Comey ""regardless"" and was thinking of the ""Russia thing"" when he decided to do so. In an Oval Office meeting with Russian diplomats last month the day after he fired Comey, Trump also reportedly called the former FBI chief a ""nut job"" and said firing him relieved ""great pressure,"" according to The New York Times. Trump and the White House have denied any collusion with Russia related to the 2016 election. People close to Comey say he is eager to speak in public, according to NBC News. He met with Mueller, who cleared him to testify. It is not clear what Mueller told Comey he could say publicly. Some legal experts have said that, if Mueller is investigating possible obstruction of justice, he may not want Comey to speak in the open about his conversations with Trump, NBC reported. Multiple reports have indicated that Comey was concerned that Trump did not respect the FBI's independence. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this article.

272,Warriors star Steph Curry founded a tech start-up with his old college teammate to shake up marketing,Tech,01-06-2017,"VIDEO2:0402:04Warriors \xe2\x80\x93 The NBA\xe2\x80\x99s golden child of Silicon ValleyThe Pulse @ 1 MarketAt first glance, Slyce looks quite familiar in Silicon Valley. It's a small software start-up with $2 million of funding and a 29-year-old founder aiming to redefine modern marketing.But there's one big difference. This start-up was co-founded by two-time NBA MVP Stephen Curry, who's trying to win his second championship in three years. Curry's Golden State Warriors host the Cleveland Cavaliers in game one of the NBA Finals on Thursday night. In 2015, Curry started Slyce with CEO Bryant Barr, a longtime friend and former hoops teammate at Davidson College. They even attended each other's weddings.Barr, who studied math and economics at Davidson before attending Stanford Business School, is Slyce's CEO and is setting out to build an automated marketing service that helps brands publish content and reach targeted audiences. Curry is one of several players on the Warriors taking advantage of the team's location and ties to the start-up world to get involved in emerging technology. Andre Iguodala, the 6-foot-6 defensive specialist, has backed electronic trading platform Trumid, Arianna Huffington's wellness company Thrive Global and health and beauty start-up Walker & Company. All-star forward Kevin Durant has invested in micro investing app Acorns and food delivery start-up Postmates.The benefits can be mutual: players create portfolios of investments that could generate returns long after they retire from basketball, while start-ups get enviable help when it comes to promoting and building their brands.Andre IguodalaDavid Orrell | CNBC Barr and Curry try and talk a few times every month about Slyce's product, customers and fundraising. Barr said Curry's involvement helps create visibility for the company and forge connections with key clients such as Under Armour, which endorses Curry.The star point guard is also a powerful recruiting tool in hyper-competitive Silicon Valley.""The fact that Steph comes into our office, or that we go to a game and talk to him afterward, is not something that any other start-up is able to do,"" Barr told CNBC, adding that new hires receive personalized video messages from Curry welcoming them to the company.For Iguodala, tech investing is not just a hobby but a defining passion. He describes himself on his LinkedIn profile first as an entrepreneur and venture capitalist, and then as an NBA athlete.Durant, who signed with the Warriors in the summer of 2016, has already won over Sand Hill Road heavyweights. Last September, he reportedly celebrated his birthday at a barbecue at the home of venture capitalist Ben Horowitz.Postmates CEO Bastian Lehmann says he meets with Durant over dinner to talk about how to improve the app's experience.VIDEO1:2301:23How the NBA's best team taps Silicon Valley for that extra edgeU.S. Video""He had a restaurant himself in Oklahoma that we delivered from on the Postmates platform,"" Lehmann said. ""We hang out and have a good time.""The Warriors have been referred to as ""tech's team,"" with Silicon Valley A-listers frequently sitting courtside at their games. Horowitz, Apple's Eddy Cue and ex-Twitter executive Adam Bain can be seen up close and personal with the players.Joe Lacob, who bought the Warriors in 2010, is a veteran venture capitalist from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. He partnered with entertainment mogul Peter Guber and formed an ownership group that includes YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley and venture investors Mark Stevens, Bob Kagle and Chamath Palihapitiya, founder of Social Capital and an early Facebook executive.That means players, when considering a tech investment, have a direct line to well-connected investors and entrepreneurs, who can offer guidance and support.For example, Draymond Green of the Warriors says he looks to Palihapitiya for investment advice.""One of my mentors on the investment side is Chamath,"" Green told CNBC. ""He's amazing. He teaches me about so many deals. And it's not just about investing, but learning and then all of a sudden you can kind of see trends -- which companies are doing well and which companies aren't doing so well.""`Taking more ownership'Professional athletes have long invested their millions in areas such as real estate to build their savings for life after basketball. But today younger players tend to be more sophisticated and personally involved, according to Courtney Brunious, associate director of USC's Sports Business Institute.""Players are now taking more ownership over decision-making when it comes to their investments,"" said Brunious, noting that the National Basketball Players Association hosted its first technology summit last summer in San Francisco to educate current and former players and provide networking opportunities with firms like Andreessen Horowitz and SV Angel.In addition to money and prestige, famous players bring some pretty attractive perks to young start-ups. Slyce's Barr, for instance, will be attending Thursday night's game, courtesy of his old pal and co-founder.""I am going to the game along with my parents,"" Barr says. ""Steph is a very generous friend.""CNBC's Kathryn Hurd contributed to this report.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/warriors-star-steph-curry-founded-start-up-slyce-to-shake-up-marketing.html
273,The brother-sister duo keeping Chopard timeless through the generations,Lasting Legacy,31-05-2017,"VIDEO2:1202:12Chopard: Keeping it in the familyLasting LegacySiblings Caroline and Karl-Freidrich Scheufele are the fourth generation owners and co-presidents of the Chopard brand.They may share similar paths of how they fell into the family business, but their different personalities meant they have complementary relationships in running the watchmaking and jewelry empire.""I'm always the dynamic one, very impatient, and he has the patience to construct movements which I think I would not have, and I admire him for that,"" said Caroline, who is creative director and responsible for the women's watches and high jewelry collections.Her elder brother, Karl-Friedrich, runs the men's collections and factory operations.""We had the unique opportunity to have to help my parents building the business, which really I call it opportunity... We didn't step into something that was already built. We were actually helping my parents shaping it and so that was very exciting for both of us,"" said Karl-Freidrich.The Chopard story started in 1860 in the Swiss village of Sonvilier, where founder Louis-Ulysse Chopard established his workshop and worked on his craft. Beyond the third generation, there was no interest in taking over the family business and that's when Caroline and Karl-Freidrich's father \xe2\x80\x94 Karl Scheufele \xe2\x80\x94 stepped in and purchased the brand in 1963.""Mr. Chopard had two sons and they didn't want to take over all \xe2\x80\x94 one was a banker, the other was a missionary in Africa. That's why we found each other \xe2\x80\x94 two family businesses,"" said Karl.ChopardA third-generation owner from Pfozheim, Germany, Karl was keen to expand his family's watchmaking and jewelry business to Geneva after an apprenticeship in Switzerland. His search started with an advertisement in the local newspaper and with 20 responses, Karl made his pick after visiting all the watchmakers' ateliers and finding the perfect purchase in LU Chopard.Karl and his wife Karin, orchestrated Chopard's expansion both locally and internationally. They established two manufacturing facilities in Meyrin and Fleurier, while expanding their retail network from one store in the 1980s to the network of over 160 boutiques today.However, it has been a challenging economic environment for luxury brands, with declining demand from the key U.S. and China markets. Consultancy Bain and Company predicted that 2016 was a low point for the luxury industry, which is an optimistic sign for the year ahead.""We are looking at an environment where the only certainty is uncertainty\xe2\x80\xa6 We definitely had a challenging 18 months behind us. But we feel that, actually, 2017 may become a bit of a better year,"" Karl-Freidrich said.When it comes to expanding the brand's presence worldwide, Caroline said she would like to see Chopard in more South American and Middle Eastern countries as well as further establish its recognition in the United States and China.But when it comes down to the core, even with an expanding global footprint and workforce, the company's values remain a constant. For the Scheufeles, remaining a family-run business is a crucial part of their value proposition.""I think the fact that we ... remained (a) family run company is certainly a characteristic for Chopard. We really cherish our independence in terms of vertical integration of our production, in terms of our distribution,"" Karl-Freidrich said.That's a point his father Karl also stressed: ""In other big companies the management change every two to three years, and in our case, we're always there, so the customers have a very close relationship with the family... Because many of our customers are also family businesses, so there's value for both sides.""Looking to the future, Karl-Freidrich said he hopes the same passion for the craft is shared by both his family and the growing 2,000-strong family that is Chopard.When the company celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2010, the family came up with a slogan: passion for excellence.""We are all very passionate about what we do \xe2\x80\x94 and ... to be passionate is also to be emotional. So the importance is to always strike the right balance between staying passionate about your business and remaining rational about your decisions,"" Karl-Freidrich said.For Karl-Friedrich and Caroline, maintaining that balance is crucial as the family looks to the future and continues the centuries-old legacy of Chopard.Catch the second season of Lasting Legacy, Thursdays in June, on CNBC Asia at 17:30 SIN/HK and on CNBC EMEA at 23:30 CET.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/the-brother-sister-duo-keeping-chopard-timeless-through-the-generations.html

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits rising to 239,000 in the latest week.It was the 117th straight week that claims were below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market.That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 10-year low of 4.4 percent.A Labor Department official said claims for California, Hawaii, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Dakota, Texas and Virginia were estimated because of the Memorial Day holiday on Monday.VIDEO0:5100:51Initial jobless claims up 13K to 248,000Squawk BoxThe four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose only 2,500 to 238,000 last week.The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday in its Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide that labor markets continued to tighten from early April through late May.The U.S. central bank said ""most"" districts had cited worker shortages across a broadening range of occupations and regions.The claims report has no bearing on the May employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday, as it falls outside the survey period. Weekly claims held below 250,000 in May, which suggests another month of strong job growth. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 211,000 in April.According to a Reuters survey of economists, payrolls likely increased by 185,000 jobs in May. The unemployment rate is forecast to be unchanged at 4.4 percent. The jobless rate has dropped by four-tenths of a percentage point this year.Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 9,000 to 1.92 million in the week ended May 20. The so-called continuing claims now have been below 2 million for seven straight weeks, pointing to shrinking labor market slack.The four-week moving average of continuing claims dropped 16,000 to 1.91 million, the lowest level since January 1974.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/us-weekly-jobless-claims-may-27-2017.html

Under the program, when a user with a third-party ad blocker enabled visits a participating site using Chrome, they will see a prompt that asks them to either turn off their ad blocker, or ""pay for a pass that removes all ads on that site through the new Google Contributor."" If they choose to pay the fee, Google will take a 10 percent cut. If they select neither choice, they won't be able to view the website.The move will help publishers who fear losing ad revenue from users with ad blockers turned on. Instead of having to manage these kinds of prompts themselves, publishers can essentially outsource this task to Google.To see the prompts, users must sign up to participate in the Google Contributor program, and must be signed in to Chrome. If they're not signed up and have an ad-blocker turned on, they won't be able to view the site. If they're not using an ad blocker at all, they'll be able to view the site as usual, complete with ads.Business Insider is among the participating sites, Google confirmed. However, publishers must first be compliant with ad standards from the Coalition of Better Ads, of which Google is a part, which could hurt some smaller publishers who have limited leverage over the types of ads they can accept.Publishers will be able to prepare their sites for these standards using an Ad Experience Report, which will provide ""screenshots and videos of annoying ad experiences we've identified to make it easy to find and fix the issues.""Pop-ups, takeover ads and ads with auto-playing audio are all considered bad ads, according to the Coalition for Better Ads.Google confirmed a new version of Chrome will launch in 2018 that will prevent websites from showing ads ""including those owned or served by Google"" on sites that don't meet its standards.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/google-confirms-ad-blocker-coming-to-chrome-in-2018.html

Sorry, but it does take 18 months \xe2\x80\x93 kind of Chipotle-like \xe2\x80\x93 for the American public to truly forgive. Remember, Wells Fargo's the Chipotle of banking, so don't get too excited because the company's got about a year left in purgatory,"" the ""Mad Money"" host explained.Still, after seeing the stock of Wells Fargo, and a slew of other lesser-known names, rise on Thursday, Cramer was comforted that the rally was broader than many investors seemed to think.""The rap against this market was that it was all FANG all the time, with a smattering of cloud and some Tesla,"" Cramer said. Today, the rally got broader, much broader, and that has to make you feel a little more confident that stocks can keep going higher, even after this year's first five months of positive returns.""FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google) apps on a smartphone.Adam Jeffery | CNBCTurning to tech, Cramer spoke with Veeva Systems founder and CEO Peter Gassner, who told the ""Mad Money"" host that his cloud computing company, which serves the life sciences space, has plans to grow its $7 billion addressable market.""We're always expanding our market, and I also think when you have a really good-quality system, a really good-quality technology that really fits the need, you expand the market,"" Gassner said.The CEO touted the company's latest quarter, which he dubbed a ""30-30 quarter"" because the company grew both revenues and profits by over 30 percent.And although the cloud seems hot now, Gassner said that the breakthrough industry is just getting started.""We're in the early days of cloud overall. This is a macro-level trend of computing that's going to play out over the next 20, 30 years,"" the CEO said.Aneel Bhusri, CEO of Workday.Mark Neuling | CNBC Then, after cloud application provider Workday reported a strong quarter, CEO Aneel Bhusri gave Cramer a simple reason why companies are choosing his software platform over larger rivals like SAP and Oracle.""It all comes back to having a great product and taking care of customers,"" Bhusri told Cramer on Thursday. ""Where I think we've really carved out our success has been at the high end of the enterprise, these very large companies where we're really the only proven solution in the marketplace.""A recent Goldman Sachs survey of CIOs showed that IT professionals are turning to Workday at the expense of Oracle and SAP.Bhusri said that with a customer satisfaction rate of roughly 97 percent, it is not hard to see how that factors in to the financial and human capital management company's gain in market share.President Donald Trump announces his decision to withdraw the US from the Paris Climate Accords in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, DC, on June 1, 2017.Brendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty ImagesPeople may be up in arms about President Donald Trump's decision to leave the Paris climate agreement, but Jim Cramer sees one glaring problem.""There's only so much any president can do unilaterally,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""While Trump supporters may cheer that he made good on a promise to pull out of the agreement, something he campaigned on, there's another part of his agenda that seems to have gone fallow that we care about here. Tax reform. It's fallen by the wayside because it requires the cooperation of Congress. And, at least right now, it almost feels like the White House has given up on Congress.""In fact, what Cramer called Washington's ""legislative logjam"" has thrown a wrench into a number of pro-business policies the Trump administration vowed to enact, including corporate tax reform, repatriation of cash from overseas, and health care reform.Now Inc. CEO: Shaky Waters for Shale?Finally, Cramer sat down with Robert Workman, the president and CEO of Now Inc., also known as DistributionNOW, an international oil and gas distribution company.Looking ahead at the oil industry's future, Workman predicted that relations between shale producers and OPEC would stay frigid for some time.""My theory of this is pretty simple: I think it's going to be shaky waters between shale producers and OPEC for a while. Maybe in three, four, five quarters more, you'll find people who think it's not going to last that long,"" the CEO told Cramer on Thursday.That said, after a major downturn in the oil patch, Workman's company has turned around, deploying some $750 million in capital, acquiring 12 companies, and chasing profitability, something the CEO said could happen this quarter if Canadian business serves.""We originally felt like we could get to profitability, from EBITDA perspective, by Q3,"" Workman told Cramer. ""Depending on how this breakup is in Canada \xe2\x80\xa6 if it's not as strong of a breakup as past years, there's a chance we get to positive EBITDA this quarter.""Lightning Round: Cramer's Go-to Philadelphia StockIn Cramer's lightning round, he sped through his take on some caller favorite stocks, including:Radian Group: ""OK, there are two Philadelphia home stocks, there's Radian and there's Toll Brothers.

279,The best and worst places to start a career,College Game Plan ,01-06-2017,"Salt Lake City, Utah.Ferrantraite | Getty ImagesThis year's college graduates are enjoying the best job market in years, but they're also weighed down with record student loan debt and have little in the way of spending cash.That makes picking a place to live, work and play all the more important for those just starting out.Three-quarters of new grads are willing to relocate to a different state to score the right job, according to a report by Accenture Strategy \xe2\x80\x93 and it's likely they'll need to. Because of the current economy, many members of the Class of 2017 are looking at jobs across the country and expect to commute farther for their first gig.And after landing a job, 62 percent of grads also said they expect to stay there for at least three years, according Accenture's 2017 U.S. College Graduate Employment study.To that end, WalletHub compared the overall livability of the country's 150 largest cities using criteria such as the availability of entry-level jobs, monthly average starting salary, workforce diversity, average commute, singles scene and ""fun factor,"" i.e. the number of bars, restaurants and parks nearby.Some millennial hotspots like New York and Chicago ranked far down the list with Cleveland and Newark, New Jersey, just outside of New York City, at the very bottom.Meanwhile, the cities that fared the best \xe2\x80\x93 with the exception of cult-favorite Austin, Texas \xe2\x80\x93 were mostly off the beaten path. At number one: Salt Lake City, Utah.These are the top 10, according to WalletHub.

280,Auto industry titans say they're still committed to cutting emissions,Autos,01-06-2017,"Cars and SUVs driving in Manhattan traffic.Mark Peterson | Corbis | Getty ImagesBoth Ford and General Motors say U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement does not affect their views on climate change, or their plans to reduce carbon emissions. And some auto industry analysts are skeptical the decision will have that much of an effect on the operations of global car companies, which sell and manufacture automobiles around the world. Traditional automakers are considered by some to be one of the sectors that would benefit from any policy change that could relax emissions standards. ""GM will not waver from our commitment to the environment and our position on climate change has not changed,"" the company said in a statement sent to CNBC. ""International agreements aside, we remain committed to creating a better environment.""The company said it advocates for ""climate action and awareness"" and is the only automaker to have signed the Ceres Climate Declaration, and one of the first companies to sign the American Business Act on Climate Pledge.""Nothing showcases our commitment more than our leadership in electric vehicles and the Chevrolet Bolt EV,"" General Motors said. Ford told CNBC the company believes ""climate change is real, and remain deeply committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our vehicles and our facilities. Our commitment to sustainability is why we're investing so heavily in electrification and adding 13 new electrified vehicles to our lineup.""Some industry analysts also point out that both companies, as well as just about every other major automaker, will continue to do business in countries that remain committed to the agreement. ""Despite the U.S. government's decision to withdraw, global automakers must continue developing vehicles to meet more stringent fuel economy and emissions standards for the rest of the world that remains part of the Paris Agreement on climate change,"" said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst for Autotrader. ""Otherwise, they risk being unable to sell their vehicles in global markets, including China, now the world's largest new-car market, and falling behind technologically.""Even cars sold in the U.S. will still have to comply with regulations overseen by government entities such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the California Air Resources Board, said Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst for Kelley Blue Book.However, she added that those standards could also come under review if the administration is determined to roll back environmental regulations. ""But while manufacturers may welcome an easing of the very stringent standards and the zero emission vehicle mandate,"" Lindland said, ""they are unlikely to suddenly change course and begin building gas-guzzling SUVs with V8 engines which are out of line with what most consumers in the U.S. are gobbling up \xe2\x80\x94 4-and 6-cylinder crossovers \xe2\x80\x94 and very much out of line with the rest of the world.""Kelley Blue Book executive editor Jack Nerad said auto companies might be a bit happier about the withdrawal than they are letting on.""Auto makers might try to mask their joy at the withdrawal from the Paris Accord on climate change,"" Nerad said, ""but many of them will rejoice that they will be less likely to be forced to sell vehicles that U.S. consumers don't seem to want.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/auto-industry-titans-say-theyre-still-committed-to-cutting-emissions.html
281,Wal-Mart employees can now deliver your online orders on their way home from work,Retail,01-06-2017,"VIDEO1:2001:20Wal-Mart testing employee delivery program in 2 statesPower LunchWalmart.com and Jet.com shoppers in three U.S. cities now have a new delivery person, and it's not employees of one of the major shipping companies like FedEx or UPS or a delivery start-up like Instacart or Deliv.It's a Wal-Mart store employee.""Unlike crowdsourced delivery, where the driver has to travel (often out of the way) to pick up the package, then drive the full distance to deliver it, our associates are starting at the same place as the packages,"" said Marc Lore, president and CEO of Walmart eCommerce U.S., in a blog post for the retailer.It all works through a proprietary app the retailer built for this test.The app matches online order delivery addresses with employees' driving routes home from work, built to minimize any more driving than what the employee would do anyway to get home. Delivering is completely voluntary, and the employees can choose when they want to deliver, how many packages they can take and what size.""Once they're done working at the store for the day, they pick up the packages from the backroom, load them into their vehicle, enter the delivery addresses into the GPS on their phone and head towards home,"" Lore said. Wal-Mart compensates the employees for it but declined to elaborate how it works.The discount retailer said the test has only been in progress for a month but so far ""hundreds"" of deliveries have been completed in two locations in New Jersey and one in Arkansas.So far, ""the response from associates and customers has been great,"" Lore said.Its locations and labor \xe2\x80\x94 some 4,700 U.S. stores with 1.3 million employees \xe2\x80\x94 are quite an asset that Lore has been working on further integrating with its digital operations. The retailer says 90 percent of the country's population live within 10 miles of a Walmart store.While the retailer does not provide a delivery cost breakdown, it's the last leg \xe2\x80\x94 commonly referred to as the ""last mile"" \xe2\x80\x94 that is the most expensive when it comes to fulfilling and shipping online orders.Consultant group McKinsey & Company estimates ""the last mile"" can sometimes be more than half of an item's total delivery cost.Last month, Wal-Mart Stores said it would offer shoppers a discount for 10,000 online-only orders that are picked up by shoppers in store rather than delivered to their homes. The discount, Marc Lore said, is ""meant to be equivalent to what the last-mile delivery costs are,"" which in most cases averages to about a 4 percent discount per item.The store pickup option saves Wal-Mart delivery costs, which it passes on to shoppers in the form of discounts, but the new employees-as-delivery-service test does not offer shoppers a discount. Wal-Mart said the benefit is that most orders are delivered the next day.WATCH: An inside look at how Amazon Prime Now delivers food and household items in less than two hoursVIDEO1:5701:57Inside Amazon's Prime Now hub in SeattleDigital Original",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/wal-mart-employees-can-now-also-deliver-your-online-orders.html

""But today's rally was about as broad-based as we've seen all year, so it's got to be a tad disconcerting to the bears who are betting we are on the verge of a sharp downturn because of a previous lack of upside participation.""After railing against the Dow Transports and categorizing their declines as a sign of overall weakness, Cramer noticed some performing better than expected on Thursday, including the stocks of FedEx and UPS.""Today, the transports gave us exactly what the bulls want from this all-important group,"" Cramer said. ""Now, we did hear a lot of activist chatter when it came to the long-faltering UPS ... but it was the dramatic move in FedEx, up more than 4 points, that made me feel like we shouldn't give up on commerce in this country, at least not yet.""Watch the full segment here:VIDEO12:4912:49Cramer: Step aside, FANG\xe2\x80\x94here are the stocks really bolstering this rallyMad Money with Jim CramerThe railroad, trucking, and freight sectors saw assorted winners as well, a signal that the transports may be gearing up for a market that is full speed ahead.Retail stocks also came to support the rally, with Dollar General delivering a much better-than-expected earnings report that sent the stock soaring. Cramer noticed the action in Dollar General's shares pulled Dollar Tree shares up with it, despite Dollar Tree's earnings miss.Home Depot's stock also turned up after a slight post-earnings decline, pulling Lowe's stock up with it.""I'd be a buyer of Home Depot right here, right now,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""It probably shouldn't have even been down in the first place.""Meanwhile, shares of department store Kohl's and bargain outlet Ollie's jumped 2.3 percent and over 6 percent respectively, signaling that brick-and-mortar stores may not be crumbling just yet.And some of technology's biggest names took a breath, allowing lesser-known tech players to come to the fore.One example was unsung Cramer-fave Box, a cloud content management play that reported a stellar quarter and saw its stock run up nearly 10 percent.""That's deserving for this cloud content management platform, although that rubric really sells the company short,"" Cramer said. ""Still, I like the irony of the short-selling analogy, because there's a huge cohort of bears who have completely shorted this stock all the way up. They didn't understand [its] ability to generate 30 percent growth.""Networking equipment company Ciena also saw an over 15 percent rally in its stock, a sign that spending in that space may be on the rise.""Isn't that a nice break from the endless leadership of the high-flying NVIDIA, which finally saw its stock do nothing today?"" Cramer noted, adding that Palo Alto Networks' over-17-percent run showed the cybersecurity name is finally ""back in the winner's cycle.""Along with a number of other daily winners in the food, construction and biotechnology sectors, Cramer also tracked the rally in the casino stocks, Wynn Resorts, Las Vegas Sands, and MGM Resorts, which posted the best numbers out of Macau in three years.""Now that the People's Republic of China has eased up on high-rolling gamblers, it was only a matter of time before these stocks returned to form,"" Cramer said. ""I like them all. I prefer Wynn, but MGM's good for low risk because of the growth it's got in Vegas.""Overall, the market seemed to pick itself up on Thursday as its leaders stepped aside and exposed underlying strength in what were once some of the most worrisome segments.""The rap against this market was that it was all FANG all the time, with a smattering of cloud and some Tesla. Today, the rally got broader, much broader, and that has to make you feel a little more confident that stocks can keep going higher, even after this year's first five months of positive returns"" Cramer concluded.Questions for Cramer?

283,"Dow, S&P and Nasdaq post record close ahead of jobs report",US Markets,01-06-2017,"VIDEO0:3800:38Major market indexes post record close Thursday Digital OriginalU.S. equities closed higher on Thursday, the first trading day in June, as Wall Street got ready for the release of the monthly jobs report.The Nasdaq composite gained about 0.8 percent, hitting intraday and record highs. The S&P 500 also rose nearly 0.8 percent to notch all-time highs, with materials, financials and health care leading advancers. The health care sector also reached its first 52-week high since March 15.The Dow Jones industrial average rose about 135 points, with UnitedHealth and Goldman Sachs contributing the most gains. The 30-stock index also traded about 25 points away from its intraday record. Economists polled by Reuters expect the U.S. economy to have added 185,000 jobs last month. But David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds, said expectations may have increased in the market after a strong report from  ADP and Moody's Analytics.The Thursday report said private payrolls surged by 253,000 in May, easily topping a consensus estimate of 185,000. ""It was a very good, positive surprise. We've had a few negative surprises, so this is definitely against the current,"" said JPMorgan Funds' Kelly. ""Overall, it says the economy is still moving along nicely.""The report from ADP and Moody's is often seen as a preview to the U.S. government's nonfarm payrolls report, which is set for release Friday at 8:30 a.m. ""What the ADP number does is it raises expectations that the jobs report can come at the top end of the range and maybe above the estimate,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.Traders celebrate on the main trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) as the Dow Jones Industrial Average passes the 20,000 mark shortly after the opening of the trading session in New York, U.S., January 25, 2017.Brendan McDermid | ReutersWall Street had a slew of data to digest Thursday, including weekly jobless claims, which came in at 248,000, above a forecast of 239,000. The ISM manufacturing index for May came in at 54.9, just below an estimate of 55.0. April construction spending fell 1.4 percent with economists forecasting a gain of 0.5 percent.Auto companies, meanwhile, released monthly vehicle sales throughout the day.Nevertheless, these data \xe2\x80\x94 along with Friday's jobs report \xe2\x80\x94 will do little to dissuade the Federal Reserve from raising rates later this month.""They have been telegraphing their moves clearly,"" said Jason Thomas, chief economist at AssetMark. ""They want to raise rates."" Thomas also noted that the central bank feels ""vindicated"" following the criticism directed for the way it has handled monetary policy in the past few years.""My sense is that they see themselves in smooth waters right now, but those waters are shallow and there are rocks beneath,"" he said. ""Unemployment is really low, but labor force participation has barely budged.""The Fed is set to meet June 13 and 14, with market expectations for a rate hike at 95.8 percent, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.The Dow, S&P and Nasdaq are coming off solid monthly performances in May. S&P and Nasdaq posted monthly gains of 1.16 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively, while the Dow rose about a third of a percent on the back of a subdued volatility environment.The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, broke below 10 six times last month, hitting levels not seen in more than 20 years.""Investors worry that the relationship between decreasing volatility and increased purchases could morph from a virtuous cycle to self-fulfilling feedback frenzy, leading to a vicious, volatility induced selloff,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank.""The extent of a potential downdraft depends on how large the risk-parity investment community is. It's widely believed that the mass of money managed under a risk-parity mandate remains small, although it's a trend worth watching,"" Ablin said in a note.Tech stocks were among the best performers as the sector continued to build on its stellar year-to-date gains. Tech has gained nearly 20 percent in 2017. By comparison, consumer discretionary, the second-best-performing sector, is up 12 percent.""Most of the growth has come from large-cap growth stocks,"" said Tom Martin,  senior portfolio manager at Globalt. ""It's still a momentum-driven market that's skeptical about cyclical land.""In corporate news, shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise slipped more than 6 percent after the firm reported a significant decline in quarterly sales.Meanwhile, Marathon Petroleum approved an additional $3 billion to its shares repurchase program.Major U.S. IndexesOn tap this week:The Dow Jones industrial average rose 135.53 points, or 0.65 percent, to close at 21,144.18, with UnitedHealth leading advancers.The  gained 18.26 points, or 0.76 percent, to end at 2,430.06, with financials leading all sectors higher.The Nasdaq advanced 48.31 points, or 0.78 percent, to close at 6,246.83.About five stocks advanced for every decliner at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 974.08 million and a composite volume of 3.839 billion at the close.FridayEarnings: Hovnanian8:30 a.m. Employment8:30 a.m. International trade",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/us-stocks-absorb-adp-report.html

Thrun led a team that created a self-driving car, winning the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge, a 130-mile course across the Mojave Desert. It proved pivotal as   Google founder Larry Page spotted Thrun at the event, disguising himself to avoid attention.\n            \n            \xe2\x80\x9cLarry came to the race itself and \xe2\x80\xa6 came disguised with, like, a hat and sunglasses so he wouldn\'t be bothered by everybody.

Not because of the response to his own presentation (which has now been watched online nearly 2.4 million times) but because he met someone at TED who completely inspired him. That person was Sal Khan, whose talk on using video to reinvent education sparked a series of events that would lead Thrun to leave his glamorous Google X role.\n\n\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cI listened to a young fellow named Sal Khan who started (the) Khan Academy. He was, like, an investment banker, had no teaching credentials. But his videos teaching just went viral. He had, like, tens of millions of students. And I was sitting at Stanford with my typical class of, like, 50 and thinking, \xe2\x80\x98God damn it. I can do that\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\t\t\tSo Thrun put his artificial intelligence class online and 160,000 students ended up taking it, of which 23,000 graduated. But the top-performing students weren\xe2\x80\x99t from Stanford, he found.\n\n\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhen they graduated, we stack ranked (evaluated) those students with the Stanford students. We give them the same exam, the same homework assignment. So you could really compare them. The top 412 students were not at Stanford.

I hadn\'t anticipated that I\'d become an online instructor or CEO of a company, a founder of a company that, that wants to democratize education. But when I realized that with this one class I had more teaching impact in this specific quarter than, like, the entire academic field combined in the entire world, I realized, \xe2\x80\x98Oh my God. Something has to be done\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\t\t\tAnd so, in 2012, Thrun left Google X, and Udacity was born.\n            \n        \n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n\t\n    \n    \t \n         \n         \t\n    \n            \n                \n                    The New York Times called our work a flop.\n                    Sebastian Thrun\n                \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n\t\n    \t\n       \n        \n        \n        \t05 The pivot\n            Nanodegrees, self-driving cars and the future\n        \n        \n         \n        \t\n        \n    \t\n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \t\n    \n    \t\n        \tPeople might say they want to change the world, but with Sebastian Thrun, many actually believe him.\n\n\t\t\tHis vision is for people to have an education, wherever they are in the world. \xe2\x80\x9cI have this dream that if we can make education globally, universally available.

285,"China's new cybersecurity law takes effect today, and many are confused",Law,31-05-2017,"VIDEO2:1902:19China's new cybersecurity law leaves companies with uncertaintyChina's new cybersecurity law takes effect today, and experts are rattled about what it all means.The law has been largely touted by Beijing as a milestone in data privacy regulations, but critics say authorities haven't provided enough information about how the wide-reaching law will be implemented. That's a big concern, as failure to comply carries fines that could hit 1 million yuan (about $150,000) and potential criminal charges.What's more, the law is expected to make it even harder to do business in China by increasing costs to foreign firms, exposing multinationals to cyber-espionage, and giving domestic companies an unfair edge. And it's adding to the already tough environment: The World Bank currently ranks the world's second-largest economy 78 out of about 190 countries in terms of ease of doing business, only a few notches above Qatar, Guatemala and Saudi Arabia.Here's what you need to know about the law now:What is it?The law focuses on protecting personal information and individual privacy, and standardizes the collection and usage of personal information. As such, companies will now be required to introduce data protection measures, and sensitive data \xe2\x80\x94 for instance, information on Chinese citizens or relating to national security \xe2\x80\x94 must be stored on domestic servers. In some cases, firms will need to undergo a security review before moving data out of China. One of the challenges, however, is that the government has been unclear on what would be considered important or sensitive data.Unauthorized collection, disclosure and receipt of a citizen's personal information now constitutes a criminal offense, according to Scott Thiel, a partner at law firm DLA Piper. Sanctions would take into account the degree of harm, and the amount of illegal gains \xe2\x80\x94 fines could go up to five times the amount of those ill-gotten gains.The law is ""not only for the legal protection for the interests of the masses in cyberspace, but also effectively safeguards national cyberspace sovereignty and security,"" according to a government statement published in state media outlet China Daily.What does it mean?For companies in China, the big question is, ""what's all this going to cost at the end of the day?"" said Benjamin Cavender, a principal at China Market Research Group.""If you're a company that was previously using services that aren't going to be looked on favorably in China, and you're forced to migrate to a new platform \xe2\x80\x94 that gets expensive really quickly,"" he said.Plus, being forced to store data domestically could pose a few problems. Firstly, foreign firms normally do need to transfer information outside of China. And secondly, keeping sensitive information on Chinese servers might mean the government can look under the hood whenever it wants, exposing multinationals to industrial espionage.Along a similar vein, it could potentially allow Beijing to even further track people it deems troublemakers. Still, it should be noted that government censorship and monitoring has long been an issue in China.""Data security is based on the best available technology internationally, and our companies already have robust IT systems in place to ensure the security of their data and IT systems in the China Market,"" said Jacob Parker, vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council.The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai has called the data localization and data transfer regulations ""unnecessarily onerous,"" with a potential impact on cross-border trade worth billions of dollars.Multinationals may be better equipped to take on the cost of compliance, but ""a lot of the small and medium sized companies may not be able to afford to put in the control that the Chinese government is asking for, and if they can't put in those controls, it may actually push them out of that country and that market,"" said James Carder, vice president of cybersecurity firm LogRhythm Labs.The EU Chamber of Commerce in China has even supported a delay in implementing the law, given what it says is the law's lack of clarity about how different aspects will be defined and enforced.Why is China doing this?For Beijing, this is one way to try to protect Chinese data from foreign spying by keeping everything contained onshore.It's also ""part of the government's push to create more white-collar jobs,"" Cavender said. That's a crucial move as authorities try to maneuver away from the old economic growth model of manufacturing and exports to one powered by services and consumption.While Chinese firms are also subject to the same data localization and transfer requirements \xe2\x80\x94 a potential challenge as many domestic companies are going global \xe2\x80\x94 experts said the regulation could help China bolster its domestic tech sector as more companies are forced to store data onshore. But that could mean continued uneven market access for foreign versus Chinese companies, which is also a long-time challenge.""The asymmetry between the access that Chinese companies enjoy in other markets and the access foreign companies have in China has been growing for some time,"" said Kenneth Jarrett, the president of the American Chamber in Shanghai.One example is that Chinese firms usually can fully own and control data centers and cloud-related services around the world without foreign equity restrictions or technology transfer requirements, but foreign cloud companies in China don't enjoy the same environment.\xe2\x80\x94CNBC's Dan Murphy contributed to this report.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/chinas-new-cybersecurity-law-takes-effect-today.html

290,Fact-checking the energy claims in Trump's Paris Agreement speech,Politics,01-06-2017,"VIDEO1:4401:44Fact-checking the energy claims in Trump's Paris agreement speech Digital OriginalPresident Donald Trump on Thursday said pulling the country out of the Paris Agreement would protect American workers from devastating economic impacts.CNBC fact-checked some of the reasons the president presented for why the United States should abandon the international accord, which aims to mitigate the impacts of climate change.The Paris Agreement would force the United States to put its abundant energy reserves under lock and key.That statement contradicts the latest long-term forecast by the U.S. Department of Energy.U.S. energy production will continue to grow through 2040 in a scenario where Obama-era energy regulations are implemented, the department's Energy Information Administration projected in January.Natural gas would surge and account for 40 percent of U.S. energy production. Oil output would continue to grow but level off in 2025 as drillers move into less-productive areas. Renewable energy generation would grow as it becomes cheaper and state and federal subsidies continue to support solar and wind energy.In that scenario, EIA would see coal production falling because of lower exports and Obama-era regulations that discourage new coal-fired plants \xe2\x80\x94 rules that Trump is currently trying to kill. The agency also sees nuclear power generation declining ""modestly"" as new facilities and upgrades offset plant retirements.The Paris Agreement blocks the development of 'clean coal' in the United States.When people refer to ""clean coal,"" they typically mean technology that captures carbon emissions from coal-fired plants, which are either stored underground or sold for use in industrial processes.This technology is very young and used in few commercial operations because it's extremely expensive. Tougher emissions standards \xe2\x80\x94 such as those encouraged by the Paris Agreement \xe2\x80\x94 would typically create an incentive to invest in the technology. Lax standards would dissuade investment.Trump often uses the term ""clean coal,"" but it's uncertain whether he's referring to so-called carbon capture, utilization and sequestration technology.The United States is not allowed to build coal plants under the Paris Agreement, but other countries can.There is nothing in the commitments made by the Obama administration that spells out what type of power plants the United States can and cannot build. Instead, the United States has simply vowed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.It is true that some climate change initiatives and energy regulations created by the Obama administration expedited the retirement of coal-fired plants, especially old and inefficient ones.However, the United States could attempt to reach its Paris Agreement goals by investing in clean coal technology that would allow plants to reduce emissions. But again, that technology is still emerging and likely wouldn't be able to immediately contribute to the country's targets.The Paris Agreement lets China do whatever it wants for the next 13 years.China has committed to reaching peak carbon emissions levels by 2030, but will try to reach that point sooner \xe2\x80\x94 and there is evidence Beijing is making progress.China's CO2 emissions may have already peaked, a full decade ahead of its Paris Agreement commitment, thanks in large part to falling coal consumption, according to the Climate Action Tracker, a scientific analysis produced by three research organizations.To be sure, more than 110 gigawatts of coal-fired plants are under construction in China, but the country's coal use likely peaked in 2013, according to the International Energy Agency.""Utilisation rates of coal-fired power plants in China are falling rapidly, as new plants enter an electricity system in which renewables have expanded fast and demand has slowed markedly,"" IEA wrote in its 2016 World Energy Outlook.Complying with U.S. commitments to the Paris Agreement could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 and shave trillions off the economy.The economic impact of climate change initiatives is a subject of debate, but it's worth considering where Trump is getting his information.The statistics Trump used in his speech came from a report on the economic impacts of greenhouse gas regulations prepared for the American Council for Capital Formation, a conservative think tank whose board includes prominent Republicans and representatives from industry trade groups.The report, prepared by NERA Economic Consulting, does not take into account potential benefits from emissions reductions or future technology that could influence costs over the long term.CEOs of some of the largest U.S.-based companies say the Paris Agreement gives them a level playing field to compete with foreign rivals and would grow the economy and create jobs by encouraging investment in new technology. Oil and gas producers like Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell also support it.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/fact-checking-the-energy-claims-in-trumps-paris-agreement-speech.html

292,The first steps to repaying your student debt,College Game Plan ,01-06-2017,"VIDEO1:1701:17How to deal with college debtCollege Game Plan For this year's crop of new college grads, few things are more exhilarating than being handed your diploma.Too bad it's so closely followed by something else: that first student loan bill.  Seven in 10 seniors graduate with debt, owing about $30,100 per borrower, according to the most recent data from the Institute for College Access & Success. For 2017 graduates, including those who don't have a job yet, the repayment process is about to begin.Employed or not, starting out with such a hefty debt load can be overwhelming. Many grads said they don't even know what they owe on their student loans, what interest rate they are paying or whether college was even worth it, according to a survey by Citizens Bank.On the upside, for federal loans at least, which make up the bulk of student debt, there is usually a six-to-eight-month grace period before the first payment is due. Private loans, though, can start even sooner or immediately. That makes this the best time for graduates to ""get their ducks in a row,"" Andrew Josuweit, CEO and president of Student Loan Hero, a student-loan management site, told CNBC in an interview.  Here's where to start:Step 1: Know your loans\xc2\xa0Many student borrowers have several loans, each potentially with a different interest rate, monthly due date and repayment period. Go to the Department of Education's central database for student aid to get a handle on repayment options and terms for federal student loans. Sites like Student Loan Hero can also provide a dashboard-type overview for borrowers. Or create a simple spreadsheet to keep track, advises David Weliver, founder of the site Money Under 30.Step 2: Update your contact information\xc2\xa0Chances are you've moved, changed your email address and have a new cellphone. Make sure each lender can reach you. ""It's easy for a loan servicer to lose track of you and if you're not getting statements you could go into default by accident,"" Josuweit said.Step 3: Check your cash flowTake your income minus expenses, including your rent and monthly loan tab, to determine if you can afford your loan payments.If you can't, look into federal income-based repayment programs, which allow you to pay a percentage of your income rather than a flat rate, as long as you are under a certain income threshold. Generally, you'll qualify if your federal student loan debt is higher than your annual discretionary income, according to the Education Department.Check with each lender to ask if they will work with you.David Weliverfounder, Money Under 30If you don't have a job yet, or are pursuing a graduate degree, consider a deferment or forbearance. A deferment lets you put your loan on hold for up to three years. If you don't qualify for a deferment, a forbearance lets you temporarily suspend payments for up to one year. However, in this case, interest will still accrue. In each case, borrowers must apply for permission to postpone payments. With private lenders, there is some flexibility but also subjectivity, Weliver said.""Check with each lender to ask if they will work with you,"" he said.Step 4: Register for autopayIf you can afford your payments, sign up for autopay. An automatic program will decrease your chances of missing a payment and may come with the added perk of an interest rate deduction on your loan.Step 5: See if your employer will chip inIf you do have a job, or are in the process of landing one, you may qualify for an employer-sponsored loan repayment program. A few companies that recruit heavily on college campuses, including PwC, EY (formerly Ernst & Young) and Fidelity, have recently rolled out repayment packages to appeal to new grads.  Step 6: Consider consolidating or refinancingOnce you have a steady job, a salary and a credit history, call a few lenders or talk to a financial advisor about your options. If you have several different loans, you might consider consolidating them. Or you may be able to refinance at a lower interest rate. You also could choose to extend the terms beyond the standard 10 years to lower your monthly payments, Josuweit said.But weigh the options first, he cautioned. Consolidating or refinancing to a private loan will forgo the safety nets that come with a federal loan, including income-based repayment programs and loan forgiveness, for those who would qualify. Additionally, extending the term of the loan means you ultimately will pay more interest on the balance.But first things first, Weliver said. For those who just hung up their cap and gown, don't get hung up by the various loan options down the road.""Focus on finding a job and setting up a life,"" he said.More from College Game Plan: The cost of borrowing for college is about to go up  Six colleges where you can earn your degree on the cheap   Starting out at community college seems like a good idea until ... it's not",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/the-first-steps-to-repaying-your-student-debt.html

A Moscow court rejected the case on May 10 which prompted a short-lived recovery in Sistema's stock price.Shamolin denied the lawsuit is actually a front for Rosneft chairman and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Igor Sechin and Sistema Chairman Vladimir Yevtushenkov to settle old scores emanating from the days of the mass and rapid privatization of Russian industries which began in earnest in the early 1990s.Mikhail Shamolin, chief executive of SistemaVictor J. Blue | Bloomberg | Getty Images""We are not personalizing this, it is not Mr. Sechin, it is Rosneft as a company that is filing the lawsuit,"" asserted Shamolin.The Sistema president then pointed to some elements of the claim, including Rosneft's dispute of the cancellation of Treasury shares which he argues is an ""absolutely typical transaction"" that companies all over the world frequently undertake, as examples of the egregiousness of Rosneft's position.Rosneft, the integrated oil company which is majority owned by Putin's government, has also included the effect of ruble depreciation in the lawsuit.""How can Sistema as a company be responsible for what happens to the ruble?"" asked Shamolin.""We have a claim and we are dealing with this in court in a civilized way and we believe that our legal position is pretty tight and we'll see how it goes,"" he concluded.In response, a Rosneft representative with knowledge of the company's information policy, said that ""arbitrage is a professional argument of the specialists in the area of the corporative law.""""It doesn't imply public discussion.

295,The Ringer and Bill Simmons get a second chance with Vox,Tech,01-06-2017,"Bill Simmons at the 2017 Code Conference on May 31, 2017.Asa Mathat for Vox MediaTwo years ago, Bill Simmons was hunkered down at his house in LA fielding calls from the who's who of the media world wanting him to join their organization.Fox. Yahoo. Showtime. They all wanted the ""Boston Sports Guy"" to join their team after being unceremoniously fired by ESPN.In the end, he signed exclusively on TV in a deal with HBO and got it to invest in a new site called, The Ringer, that would mimic his old site, Grantland, in writing detailed pieces about sports and pop culture.The deal was smart in that it kept Simmons' profile high by being on TV on one of the most prestigious networks, paid him a high salary for three years (estimated at $7 million to $9 million per year), and kicked in some capital to get The Ringer off the ground.Fast forward to today. Simmons' interview show on HBO, ""Any Given Wednesday,"" was canceled after only four months. His only current HBO project that's been mentioned is a documentary on wrestler Andre the Giant. His HBO contract will expire in a little over a year.The Ringer, which took about a year to launch, debuted last July with 1.2 million monthly unique visitors. That was a marked decrease from  6 million uniques in March 2015 at Grantland, just before Simmons was fired. Of course, The Ringer didn't have ESPN directing traffic to it. Even still, traffic kept slumping. Monthly uniques were 306,000 in February according to ComScore \xe2\x80\x94 or 95 percent less than Grantland's former numbers. (Update: A spokesperson from Vox claims that The Ringer has 5 million monthly uniques, and that the ComScore numbers are inaccurate because Medium ""does not allow any external tracking metrics."")""To put The Ringer's current monthly traffic in comparison to other sports sites, take a look at this list:Yahoo Sports 125MESPN 80MBleacher 40MCBS Sports 30MSI 20MNBC Sports 19.5MSB Nation 19MDeadspin 12.5MYardBarker 4MThe Ringer 0.3M (Update: Vox claims 5M)There's nowhere to go but up for The Ringer.On Wednesday, The Ringer announced what it hopes will be a second chance by moving its publishing platform from Medium to Vox Media. Additionally, Vox will start selling ads for The Ringer and the two companies will  split those revenues. Vox will also start directing traffic toward The Ringer from SB Nation, which had 19 million monthly uniques in May. This should greatly help the revenues of The Ringer which on most days in the past year has had no display ads except for brand sponsors like Miller Lite.At the moment, it appears that the only money the Bill Simmons Media Group is making is from its podcasts. Last month, based on publicly available data,  I estimated that it was generating about $8.5 million a year in revenues from the podcasts. Since then, I've noticed the pace of podcasts seems to have crept up and I've also heard a few Ringer podcasts where the presenting ""sponsor"" for the podcast is ""The Ringer.""Surprisingly for a primarily podcast business, The Ringer employs about 70 full-time employees. That means those costs are likely running at $4 million to 7.5 million a year. These are talented writers and personalities. I'm amazed at how much content they are pushing out in podcast form and articles for a website running no ads against them.Things could still work out very well for Simmons and all the employees. A year from now, Vox could significantly increase The Ringer's traffic and could be generating double or more of its current revenues, pushing it solidly into the black. For The Ringer, getting 50 percent of some website revenue is better than 100 percent of no website revenue, which is what it has had on the Medium platform. It has interesting content and people working hard to pump it out every day. Now it has people around to help make some money from it.This increase in the financial health of The Ringer could prompt Vox to buy the Bill Simmons Media Group for $50 million to $100 million. All 70 Ringer employees would keep their jobs. Simmons would have an enormous payday. Vox would get a well-recognized personality and brand, as well as one of the most popular podcasts in the world in a medium that should only increase in popularity over time.However, if The Ringer is really going to achieve its full potential and make the most of this second chance with the help of Vox Media, it's important that Simmons and  his president, Eric Weinberger, really look in the mirror. Neither one of them has shown himself to be adept at running this business to date as the following illustrates:What was the need to overstaff so quickly to get to 70 full-time employees given this has been a podcast company? Was it more about getting back at ESPN than good business sense?""Partnering"" with Medium for publishing and revenue generation was disastrous in hindsight. But even before they signed the deal, did Simmons and Weinberger talk to anyone in the media world about Medium's abilities to generate ad sales for the website? Medium was having difficulties generating their own revenues.Has there been any thought at the top of The Ringer about search engine optimization and traffic referral? It doesn't appear so from the outside.Did they make a fundamental error in believing that, if they hired as many on staff as they had at Grantland, they would generate the same traffic of 6 million a month? Did they not understand how much of that Grantland traffic came from ESPN and wouldn't be transferrable?When they replicated Grantland as The Ringer, did they really look at the trends toward mobile and understand the declining interest in 5,000 word thinkpieces? Constantly writing lots and lots of text for a website is not a great business today, especially when you're not monetizing it.Simmons, as ultimately it's his name on the door, has to look in the mirror and understand his strength is not being a CEO or business executive. The Ringer's staff and Simmons would likely be best off if Vox Media did buy them. They could lean into Jim Bankoff of Vox to run the business and they \xe2\x80\x94 including Simmons \xe2\x80\x94 could just focus on the content.Simmons is one of the best and most popular podcasters in the world. That's more than enough. He's stiff on TV and he's not great at business. This Vox deal really is his second chance. He should make the most of it.Correction: The revenue split between Vox and The Ringer has not been disclosed. To sign up for Eric Jackson's monthly Tech & Media Email,  go here.

About 100 people have signed up to receive an infusion, founder Dr. Jesse Karmazin said Wednesday at the Code Conference. Anyone over age 35 can become an Ambrosia customer, said Karmazin, but most of the early adopters tend to be of retirement age. He also stressed that it's a range of people, and not just Bay Area technologists, who have signed up.A controversial plan to inject young blood into older peopleChristina FarrThe donated blood typically comes from teenagers, although anyone under age 25 is eligible. The company buys its supply from blood banks, which also sell blood to pharmaceutical companies. So high-schoolers donating their blood are not aware that it might be used on healthy adults. Speaking to a roomful of technologists, Karmazin explained that the company does not claim that it can cure aging. Instead, he's hoping to recruit hundreds more people to research whether the transfusions can help fight particular symptoms associated with aging. Traditionally, biological aging hasn't been treated as a disease, which makes it challenging to study. Karmazin said those who have signed up have seen some positive benefits and haven't reported any negative ones. Blood transfusions come with a variety of risks, including allergic reactions. Karmazin started the company after reviewing research into whether injecting older mice with the plasma portion of young ones can improve memory. Other so-called parabiosis studies went a step further in connecting older and younger animals so that their blood mingles.These studies are far from definitive, and scientists have spoken out about the ethics of such a study, which they see as taking advantage of the public's excitement and lacking much evidence. But the concept has seen a recent resurgence in interest because well-known Silicon Valley investors like Peter Thiel have spoken out about its promise. But that does not mean Thiel gets teenage blood transfusions, said Karmazin, a graduate of Stanford Medical School. Karmazin stressed that Thiel is not an Ambrosia customer \xe2\x80\x94 and to his knowledge, Ambrosia is the only U.S. company on the market. ""Of course, it's possible he could have gone abroad,"" Karmazin shrugged.

""We are nowhere near that on the technology side, and it's distracting to the fact that AI today can help the world in so many places, and the discourse is being taken over by folks that are alarmists, around something that might happen in 100 years, 150 years,"" Hodjat told CNBC during an interview at the Pioneers tech show in Vienna on Thursday.  ""This can help us find the cure to cancer or solve world hunger, and I'm not joking. These are the types of projects that people are looking at and we are just making all this unnecessary and in my opinion, a lot comes from people who don't, have not been involved that deeply in AI in the past. Somehow they have seen the power of it and they are jumping to conclusions that's my sense.""Hodjat said that humans have been augmenting themselves for a while, by wearing clothes or using smartphones and computers. While a future in which the brain becomes augmented by a computer is possible, Hodjat said this is unlikely to come soon.  ""I think that is science fiction more than something that is necessary today and it's way out there, there are many many technologies that have to be solved before we get there.""  Sentient Technologies is a U.S.-based AI firm which is applying the technology to different sectors such as finance and e-commerce.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/elon-musk-nueralink-alarmist-sentient-technologies.html

Richards | AFP | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration has rolled out a new questionnaire for U.S. visa applicants worldwide that asks for social media handles for the last five years and biographical information going back 15 years.The new questions, part of an effort to tighten vetting of would-be visitors to the United States, was approved on May 23 by the Office of Management and Budget despite criticism from a range of education officials and academic groups during a public comment period.Critics argued that the new questions would be overly burdensome, lead to long delays in processing and discourage international students and scientists from coming to the United States.Under the new procedures, consular officials can request all prior passport numbers, five years' worth of social media handles, email addresses and phone numbers and 15 years of biographical information including addresses, employment and travel history. Officials will request the additional information when they determine ""that such information is required to confirm identity or conduct more rigorous national security vetting,"" a State Department official said on Wednesday.The State Department said earlier the tighter vetting would apply to visa applicants ""who have been determined to warrant additional scrutiny in connection with terrorism or other national security-related visa ineligibilities.""President Donald Trump has vowed to increase national security and border protections, proposing to give more money to the military and make Mexico pay to build a wall along the southern U.S. border.He has tried to implement a temporary travel ban on people from six Muslim-majority nations that a U.S. appeals court refused to reinstate, calling it discriminatory and setting the stage for a showdown in the Supreme Court.The Office of Management and Budget granted emergency approval for the new questions for six months, rather than the usual three years.While the new questions are voluntary, the form says failure to provide the information may delay or prevent the processing of an individual visa application.Immigration lawyers and advocates say the request for 15 years of detailed biographical information, as well as the expectation that applicants remember all their social media handles, is likely to catch applicants who make innocent mistakes or do not remember all the information requested.The new questions grant ""arbitrary power"" to consular officials to determine who gets a visa with no effective check on their decisions, said Babak Yousefzadeh, a San Francisco-based attorney and president of the Iranian American Bar Association.""The United States has one of the most stringent visa application processes in the world,"" Yousefzadeh said.

304,Sen. Blumenthal demands Mylan pay Medicaid full $1.27 billion for alleged EpiPen rebate shortfall,Biotech and Pharma,01-06-2017,"VIDEO1:0101:01Sen. Blumenthal demands Mylan pay Medicaid full $1.27 billion for alleged EpiPen rebate shortfallNews VideosWe're gonna need a bigger check.Sen. Richard Blumenthal and a group representing state Medicaid directors are demanding drugmaker Mylan pay Medicaid up to $1.27 billion after disclosures the company may have shorted the program by that amount in rebates for its EpiPen anti-allergy device over a decade.Blumenthal, D-Conn., at the same time blasted Mylan's purported settlement with the U.S. Justice Department for a mere fraction of that amount \xe2\x80\x94 just $465 million \xe2\x80\x94 to resolve claims that EpiPen was for years misclassified as a generic product for Medicaid's drug rebate program. Generic products are assessed a much lower rebate than brand-name drugs in that program.""Mylan's outrageous multiyear classification has cost American taxpayers not just millions but billions,"" Blumenthal said. ""The Department of Justice's deal is completely insufficient \xe2\x80\x94 a shadow of what it should be.""""Mylan owes the American taxpayers $1.27 billion,"" he said. ""It is time to collect.""Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, said, ""This is $1.27 billion that they absolutely do owe back to the government, who they've been ripping off.""""You've got to look back and say, 'How much they've been sticking it to us?' and [have Mylan] pony up,"" said Salo.He added his group's members have been saying for months that Mylan's settlement with the Justice Department is ""not sufficient.""The members of Salo's group oversee state Medicaid programs, which split proceeds from the drug rebate program with the federal government. Medicaid, which provides health coverage primarily to low-income people, is jointly run by the federal government and individual states.VIDEO0:4700:47Sen. Grassley: US overpaid an estimated $1.27 billion for EpiPenClosing BellSalo said that ""this may be a great time to go back and say, 'Let's throw out this settlement.'"" Mylan has told CNBC for months that its agreement to pay the Justice Department $465 million is not finalized. The company announced the settlement, in which it admitted no wrongdoing, in October, after weeks of saying that it had properly classified EpiPen for purposes of the Medicaid drug rebate program.New York City's comptroller, Scott Stringer, said, ""These new allegations are simply shocking.""""If true, Mylan not only forced massive price hikes on consumers, but also overcharged American taxpayers more than a billion dollars for a life-saving drug,"" Stringer said. ""At the same time, [Mylan's] board granted enormous pay packages to top executives. It's improper and it's immoral. Now, Mylan's shareowners are suffering the consequences. This is ultimately a Board failure \xe2\x80\x94 that's why investors are demanding change.""Stringer has oversight of New York City's pension fund. That fund, along with the pension fund of New York state, the California State Teachers' Retirement System and the Dutch pension fund PGGM, are jointly campaigning to have fellow Mylan shareholders reject the re-election of six company directors at Mylan's annual meeting June 22.The quartet of funds are unhappy about, among other things, the fact that one director, Mylan Chairman Robert Coury, received almost $100 million in compensation last year, when the company was facing public outrage over its price hikes for EpiPen.On Thursday, a Mylan spokeswoman declined to comment on Blumenthal's and Salo's demands for additional payments to Medicaid, other than noting that, ""We continue to work with the government to finalize the settlement as soon as possible.""A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.Mylan's spokeswoman, when asked about the critique by pension funds, said, ""Mylan's Board has overseen the development of a differentiated, clear and consistent long-term strategy that has created sustained long-term value for shareholders, while also serving the best interests of all stakeholders.""She noted that over the past 15 years, the market capitalization of Mylan had grown from about $3 billion to $20 billion, and that the stock price has risen by 140 percent in absolute terms. She said that almost all of Coury's compensation was granted and earned over his 15-year stint as CEO and then executive chairman.""During Mr. Coury's long tenure, Mylan has delivered strong financial performance and shareholder growth, and his new compensation structure continues to be aligned with the company's stock performance,"" she said.The demands for additional money from Mylan came after Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, on Wednesday revealed the size of the potential underpayment to Medicaid for EpiPen.The Senate Judiciary Committee, which Grassley is chairman of, had asked the inspector general's office of the federal Health and Human Services Department to calculate how much Mylan owed the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program if EpiPen had been classified as a brand-name product, instead of as a generic one.Brand-name products are assessed higher rebate rates \xe2\x80\x94 at least 23.1 percent of sales \xe2\x80\x94 than the 10 percent rebate rate applied to generic drugs sold through Medicaid. But brand-name products whose prices are raised beyond the rate of inflation can pay a much higher rebate than that 23.1 percent.Analysts have said that because of that, Mylan, which raised the price of EpiPen by more than 500 percent in recent years, could have owed Medicaid rebates that were nearly equal to the dollar amount of EpiPen sales through the program.Mylan for years classified EpiPen, which treats potentially fatal allergic reactions, as a generic product. Federal health officials have said that they told Mylan it was misclassifying EpiPen, and that it should be treated as a brand-name product.In a letter to the Judiciary Committee, the inspector general's office said it estimated the difference between what Mylan had paid Medicaid for EpiPen and what it could have owed if the auto-injector device was classified as a brand-name. The office said that based on the methodology that it used, which had some limitations, ""we determined the Estimated Rebate Differential to be $1.27 billion for 2006 through 2016.""The inspector general's office noted that it ""did not determine whether Mylan's classification under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program was actually correct.""""Nor did we determine the amount of rebates, if any, the Federal Government should seek to recover now,"" the office said in its letter.Mylan, in a regulatory filing in October, had said that it would begin paying Medicaid the higher brand-name rebate rate in April. But the company in March refused to say whether it was going through with that plan.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/blumenthal-wants-mylan-to-pay-medicaid-more-than-1-billion-for-epipen.html

To Max Wolff, market strategist at 55 Institutional, this combination of sectors suggests a ""tug of war""""You either totally believe and you think growth is coming, and you want to get the high multiple, high risk, high return growth names ... or you're really nervous, you think you're way out over your skis and you want to hunker down and have consumer nondiscretionary and utilities. It really speaks to a market and half the people are pushing one way, and half the people are pushing the other,"" Wolff said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""""Tech is really overpriced, but at least it delivers growth, and that's why people are crowding in there.

""If you can ride that dissonance, it kind of makes sense as a portfolio.""Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, sees things a bit differently.For the high-yielding utilities and staples, ""one of the key factors has been interest rates. And I think more recently, with interest rates turning lower, you've seen the sectors that act as bond proxies like utilities, like consumer staples as well, become leadership while the flip side of that trade, financials, have really been under pressure,"" Wald said Wednesday on ""Trading Nation.""Meanwhile ""throughout these market rotations, whether it's risk-on, risk-off, rates up, rates down, commodities up, commodities down ... technology has really been the resilient sector that's been able to outperform throughout all these market environments,"" he added.Going forward, Wald suggested that investors look specifically to cyclical growth stocks.""Russell growth \xe2\x80\x94 tech-heavy \xe2\x80\x94 versus the Russell value, you can see Russell growth breaking out to the upside.

The sector, composed of a range of financial services firms such as insurance companies and banks, was leading the market for part of the year to date and was up 9 percent as of the beginning of March. The drop is a function of rates falling, along with ongoing concerns about global growth, said Oppenheimer head of technical analysis Ari Wald. The yield curve, which serves as a gauge of economic growth, has flattened on the year, and generally that does not bode well for the banks, which rely on healthy net interest margins. Financials underperforming in a falling-interest-rate environment flashes a ""lacking vote of confidence about economic growth,"" he wrote Wednesday in an email to CNBC. Signals from the bond market indicate a premium should rather be placed on U.S. growth sectors, Wald said, like technology. The sector has dipped into the red year to date as the third-worst-performing sector (just ahead of the telecommunications and energy sectors). May has been a particularly rough month for the group; the sector was the second-worst-performing sector for the month, beaten to the downside only by energy. At this juncture, investors ought to ""sit-and-wait"" on the financials, said Max Wolff, market strategist at 55 Institutional. Investors in the space were betting on sure-fire economic growth, reflation around the world, deregulation, and interest rate and balance sheet normalization following the U.S. election, he wrote in an email to CNBC. But the ""reflation trade"" and the prospects for deregulation under the Trump administration are now less certain, he wrote. What's more is the share prices of the financials appear to have ""leap-frogged into aggressive space"" in hopes of such promised economic growth and deregulation. In a note to clients Thursday, Michael Block of Rhino Trading Partners acknowledged that the financials have not performed well relative to technology, which is leading the market. Block said tech stocks could indeed keep running, but likely not in the very near-term.

308,We really have no idea what causes birth defects,Health and Science,01-06-2017,"Comzeal | Getty ImagesEvery year, nearly eight million children come into the world with major birth defects. Many won't live long enough to see their first birthday. And for most of these babies, we don't even know what went wrong to cause the defects in the first place.That's the finding of a new study published in the latest issue of the British Medical Journal. Researchers from the University of Utah looked at about 5,500 cases of major birth defects among children born in the state between 2005 and 2009. For only 20 percent of them was it possible to trace the defect to a specific cause, the overwhelming majority of which were problems with the children's chromosomes or genes, with a few more down to environmental exposure to chemicals, radiation, or infection.But for the other 80 percent, the researchers couldn't pin down any particular cause for the defects. That doesn't mean genetic or environmental factors weren't responsible for these problems \xe2\x80\x94 it's just that there wasn't enough evidence to say. There were also possible risk factors that could help explain these, including the mother smoking or having diabetes or obesity, but the role any of those play in causing specific defects is complicated and uncertain.More from Vocativ: Augmented reality is entering the House of GodFantasy spelling bee leagues exist for some reasonCourt says Facebook can block parents from deceased teen's accountThis might all seem like a bookkeeping issue. But not knowing causes of birth defects means doctors are also bad at predicting them in advance and that risk screenings for prospective parents will also be difficult to improve.All this comes at a terrible price: The total health care cost for children with birth defects is more than $2.6 billion every year in the United States, and about one in five of such children die in their first year of life. What's more, the birth defect rate hasn't dropped in decades, and it might actually be set to increase as diabetes and obesity reach epidemic proportions. Perhaps medical science can't have all the answers, but as the researchers argue, it's urgent to start looking for them.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/we-really-have-no-idea-what-causes-birth-defects.html

312,Time Warner CEO: Net regulations unfairly favor Google and Facebook,Tech,31-05-2017,"Jeffrey 'Jeff' Bewkes, chairman and chief executive officer of Time Warner Inc.Patrick T. Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTime Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said Wednesday that existing U.S. regulations covering internet content unfairly favor Facebook and Google and that his company agreed to be acquired by AT&T to better compete with those technology giants.""You have the FCC putting regulations on cable and telco companies, you have the FTC putting regulations on Facebook that are much more lax. I'd like to see it be even,"" Bewkes said in response to a question about so-called Net Neutrality rules during an onstage interview at the Code Conference in Ranch Palos Verdes, California. Time Warner last year agreed to be acquired by  for $85 billion in a deal that will provide the wireless giant with a stable of news and entertainment content while giving Time Warner new ways of distributing its shows.AT&T will also get valuable data on its end users, which Bewkes says it needs to better compete for advertising dollars amid stiffer competition from the tech industry.""We're increasingly competing with West Coast global businesses that want to get in the video business,"" Bewkes told the gathering of tech executives.Google's YouTube unit now hosts one billion hours of video viewing per day, CEO Sundar Pichai told Wall Street analysts in April, during a conference call to discuss the first-quarter earnings of its parent company, Alphabet. is also making a bigger push into video and is reportedly getting ready to roll out its own original shows sometime in June.Those two Silicon Valley giants accounted for 85 percent of the growth in digital advertising spending last year, according to an annual report on the Internet presented at the conference earlier Wednesday from Mary Meeker, a partner with venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins.To garner a bigger chunk of that growth, Time Warner needs better data on those who watch its networks, including CNN, HBO, Showtime and Comedy Central.""We're trying to get more data, to compete more effectively with a much bigger set of data that the digital companies have,"" Bewkes said.The mega-merger, which Bewkes said is ""good for America,"" is expected to close this year after FCC Chair Ajit Pai said in February the agency doesn't expect to review it.Cable and telecom companies, including AT&T, have in the past argued against the net neutrality rules enacted two years ago under former FCC chair Tom Wheeler, saying that they unfairly favor firms that use lots of network traffic.Those rules prevent internet service providers from favoring or discriminating against network traffic from any particular provider, such as Google, Facebook or Netflix. Industry watchers widely expect those rules to be undone by the FCC, which now has a Republican majority.Disclosure: CNBC parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Recode's parent Vox Media.

313,Exchange-traded funds are the go-to investment choice of advisors: Survey,Portfolio Perspective,01-06-2017,"Exchange-traded funds are continuing their reign as the go-to investment choice of financial advisors, but cash isn't far behind, according to a new study.Released today by the Financial Planning Association, the 2017 Trends in Investing Survey shows that 88 percent of advisors either use or recommend ETFs and 85 percent turn to cash or cash equivalents.While this is the first time the yearly survey shows cash beating out mutual funds (which are used by 80 percent of advisors), it marks the third consecutive year that ETFs are favored.Which investment vehicles do you [as a financial advisor] currently use/recommend with clients?INVESTMENT VEHICLE % Exchange traded funds88%Cash/equivalents85%Mutual funds (non-wrap)80%Individual stocks61%Individual bonds52%Mutual fund wrap program(s)33%Variable annuities32%Fixed annuities32%Private equity funds15%Hedge funds9%""ETFs have gone from representing a very small part of [advisors'] tool kit to now representing a very significant part,"" said certified financial planner David Yeske, managing director of Yeske Buie.""One of the things it suggests is that financial planners are ever more convinced that active management is hard,"" said Yeske, who helped develop the survey and interpret its results.Unlike actively managed mutual funds \xe2\x80\x94 where a professional picks the individual holdings of a fund \xe2\x80\x94 ETFs track indexes, making them passively managed.The survey also shows that 77 percent of advisors now think a blend of active and passive management delivers the best overall performance. That number stood at 64 percent last year and 57 percent three years ago.More from Portfolio Perspective:Why asset allocation is so important to portfolios What makes an advisor trustworthy? Buying stock? Ask yourself this question firstAs for the increase in cash-type investments, Yeske said it could signal that advisors are taking a more conservative stance on the market.""This makes me think that planners are feeling a sense of caution about the investment world and are building resilience in client portfolios,"" said Yeske, who worked on the survey in his role as an editor at the Journal of Financial Planning.Advisors' use of cash has remained high following the 2008-2009 housing crisis and accompanying market nosedive. In the 2008 survey, before the crisis came to a head, 52 percent of advisors were using cash or equivalents. By 2010, that figure had jumped to 84 percent. The general trend since then has been a continued high use, although this year's figure of 85 percent is up from 74 percent a year ago.The survey \xe2\x80\x94 a collaboration of the FPA, the Journal and Longboard Asset Management \xe2\x80\x94 also shows that half of responding advisors plan to increase their use or recommendation of ETFs over the next year. That's compared to 20 percent planning to increase their use of mutual funds and 19 percent for individual stocks.Unlike actively managed mutual funds, ETFs track indexes, making them passively managed.Daniel Fung | Getty ImagesIn 2006, the first year of the survey, just 40 percent of advisors reported using ETFs. By 2015, that had grown to 81 percent and took over mutual funds' position as the favorite investment of advisors.CFP Douglas Kobak said he dedicates about 80 percent of his growth-oriented client portfolios to ETFs.""They give me the flexibility to buy and sell during the day, I get transparency so I know exactly what's in the ETF, and the costs are low,"" said Kobak, a senior advisor and principal of Main Line Group Wealth Management.Almost half (49 percent) of advisors cite lower costs as the biggest advantage of ETFs, followed by tax efficiency (23 percent) and trading flexibility (14 percent).Portfolio diversification was explored for the first time in the survey this year, and it shows that 47 percent of advisors are looking for new ways to diversify client investments. Additionally, 27 percent say today's market conditions make diversification difficult.Clients have to understand that diversity is more about achieving a certain amount of investment security and safety over the long-term.David Yeskemanaging director of Yeske BuieIndeed, the performance correlation among different investments is higher than it used to be. Kobak said, for instance, that the performance correlation among U.S. large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap stocks is more than 90 percent.""When you hit that level, the markets are all moving up and down together,"" Kobak said. ""So what you used to be able to do to diversify in the 1990s, you can't do today.""Yeske at Yeske Buie said that, in the short-term, it's difficult to prevent portfolio volatility through diversification.""No matter how you diversify, everything will move [up or down] together in the short run,"" Yeske said. ""But clients have to understand that diversity is more about achieving a certain amount of investment security and safety over the long-term.""More than a third, 36 percent, of surveyed advisors question whether a traditional portfolio asset allocation of 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds can provide the same returns it has historically.The biggest changes from last year in advisors' reasons for reevaluating their asset allocation strategy included inflation (40 percent, compared with 28 percent last year), anticipated changes to income taxes (35 percent versus 24 percent) and investment taxes (32 percent versus 21 percent).Meanwhile, despite the increased use of cash or cash equivalents, 52 percent of advisors are bullish on the near-term economy. That's double the 26 percent who expressed such optimism in last year's survey. Just over a third of respondents (35 percent) are neutral in their outlook.""I don't think there will be much movement in the market either way in the next six months,"" said Kobak of Main Line Group Wealth Management. ""Until new information comes out about [potential] tax law changes, I think the market will stay in the range it is right now.""\xe2\x80\x94 By Sarah O'Brien, special to CNBC.com",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/exchange-traded-funds-are-the-go-to-investment-choice-of-advisors-survey.html
314,Casino stocks rally as Macau's May gaming revenues crush estimates,Casinos and Gaming,01-06-2017,"Philippe Lopez | AFP | Getty ImagesCasino stocks are posting big wins Thursday on Macau's gross gaming revenue in May sharply beating industry analysts' expectations.  In intraday trading, Las Vegas Sands is up nearly 4 percent and Wynn Resorts ahead more than 4 percent. And MGM Resorts is up just over 2 percent.  Macau GGR had been expected to grow about 16.5 percent for the month of May but came in at 23.7 percent.  ""We believe a strong start to June could lead to the Street's estimates, and ours, to move higher ahead of earnings reporting season in mid-July,"" said Telsey Advisory Group casino analyst David Katz in a research note to clients.  Added Katz, ""Coupled with the 16.3 percent growth in April, we believe it is a fair conclusion that the new properties in the market, including LVS' Parisian and WYNN's Palace are growing the market rather than cannibalizing the existing properties.""  May marked the tenth consecutive month of gaming growth in the world's largest gambling mecca.   ""Based on our on-the-ground conversations, we believe that the mass market trajectory seen in 1Q17 (up 15 percent) has carried through into 2Q and is likely now in the high teens,"" said Union Gaming analyst Grant Govertsen in a report Thursday. Wynn Resorts is one Macau operator that ""continues to outperform the market by a very wide margin,"" Govertsen said.   Overall, he said growth in the mass-market segment in Macau is helping ""most of the Macau Big-6."" The VIP segment, meanwhile, is showing ""accelerating"" growth but he cautioned that's partly due to easy comparisons.  Indeed, Bernstein analyst Vitaly Umansky also voiced caution when looking at Macau trends, particularly ""the accuracy of weekly channel check estimates and the strength (and volatility) surrounding VIP.""  According to Umansky, ""High hold rates in VIP along with continued volume strength creates volatility and lack of ability to more accurately forecast the monthly trend.""  That said, the Bernstein analyst added that the firm's channel checks during the month appear to show Macau operators Wynn Resorts and Galaxy Entertainment Group having month-over-month gains in market share, with Las Vegas Sands among those showing ""deterioration."" He said MGM's market share was ""generally unchanged"" during the same comparison period.  Looking ahead, Umansky forecast in a report that Macau's June gaming revenues would be up between 20 to 26 percent.""The Macau gaming industry has now shown a strong recovery from over two years of declines,"" said the Bernstein analyst. ""We continue to view the industry as a secular growth story driven by the paradigm shift from VIP to mass.""He said the VIP market has exhibited ""considerable strength over the past half year,"" although he added that over the long haul this segment of the market ""will continue to face structural headwinds from a tightening regulatory environment in Macau.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/casino-stocks-rally-as-macaus-may-gaming-revenues-crush-estimates.html

316,Watch: Trump announces his Paris climate deal decision,Politics,01-06-2017,"In a heavily-teased event at the White House Rose Garden, President Donald Trump announced Thursday that the United States will withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement. The decision will set the world's largest economy apart from almost all other nations on earth and moves in opposition to many large American companies, as well.Former President Barack Obama said withdrawing from climate accord will mean a loss of new jobs and industries.Trump and many of his allies have long dubbed the Paris Agreement a ""bad deal"" for America. They say it forces the United States to make immediate sacrifices that will hurt the economy, while other countries such as China are allowed to put off action until later.Trump recently faced pressure from many large American companies and allies abroad, who back the landmark global deal to curb emissions. He promised to back out of the agreement as a candidate, but White House advisors recently suggested that his views on climate change were evolving.More than two decades of climate diplomacy produced the Paris Agreement in December 2015. The accord requires the 195 signatories \xe2\x80\x94 nearly every country in the world \xe2\x80\x94 to create national plans to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in a bid to mitigate the effects of climate change.Syria and Nicaragua are the only countries in the U.N. group that are not signatories.The treaty aims to prevent global temperatures from rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\xe2\x80\x94 CNBC's Tom DiChristopher contributed to this report",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/watch-trump-announce-his-paris-climate-deal-decision.html

The widely followed report led with a claim that the auto industry announced 20,271 job cuts for the month, with the majority of those stemming from Ford.On Friday, the consultancy firm corrected its error, saying planned layoffs dropped to 33,092 in the month from the 51,692 initially reported.In its report Thursday, Challenger CEO John A. Challenger said: ""Ford's announcement of 20,000 global layoffs to streamline and cut costs is a typical strategy of large corporations who need to pivot to stay competitive.""However, Ford told CNBC it never confirmed the 20,000 number with any media source.In fact, the actual number is more like 1,400 jobs being eliminated, according to a Ford spokesperson.

Instead, Google will give publishers a 6-month lead time to get things in order, according to The Wall Street Journal.Publishers will have access to a new tool that'll let them know whether or not their ads are deemed unacceptable by the Coalition for Better Ads.The move may end up hurting smaller sites that rely on lower-quality ads the most, since those types of ads are more prevalent on sites that don't generate as much traffic as much larger publishers. The Coalition for Better Ads' website identifies both desktop and mobile web ads that it deems unacceptable for end-user experiences.VIDEO1:4401:44Google assistant is \xe2\x80\x98definitely useful\xe2\x80\x99, says directorSquawk Box EuropeThe unacceptable list includes pop-ups, ads that auto-play with sound, ads that appear before the homepage loads, and large sticky ads on the desktop. On mobile, it expands the unacceptable ads to include full-screen scrollover ads, flashing animated ads and ad density higher than 30 percent.Alphabet relies heavily on Google's ad business, which generated $21.4 billion in revenue during the first quarter of 2017. Google's move is likely to encourage Chrome users to turn off existing ad blockers, allowing a larger percentage of high-quality ads to still present themselves. In turn, that might increase Google's ever-important click-through rate.Google hasn't yet said exactly when the new ad filter will launch in Chrome, but it's expected next year.

321,Bond market\xe2\x80\x99s recession warning is at odds with the stock market trading near all-time highs,Market Insider,31-05-2017,"VIDEO2:4802:48Faber: I would rather invest in Europe than USHalftime ReportStocks are near record highs, driven by surging tech shares, a sharp contrast with the bond market, where interest rates have been sinking on worries the economy just isn't getting enough juice for growth to pick up.The also is just a short hop to record territory, and it too tells a very different story from the Treasury market, where the belief is that the Federal Reserve may have to stop raising interest rates after its next hike in mid-June because of weak inflation or growth or both. As of Wednesday, traders were pricing in just 1.4 rate hikes this year, instead of the two forecast by the Fed.The ups and downs in expectations for fiscal stimulus from Washington have been a factor in the diverging market behavior. ""I think it's more like what the growth outlook looks like beyond this year. The market is showing a lot of skepticism about the belief that anything will get done on the fiscal policy side,"" said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rate strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The bond market has also benefited from low yields in other parts of the globe, which have sent investors into U.S. Treasurys with relatively higher U.S. yields. Yields move opposite to prices.""Everybody looks at stocks and says: When is the equity market going to have a Trump unwind?"" said Michael Schumacher, head of rates strategy at Wells Fargo. Schumacher said the bond market has been factoring out the Trump reflation trade, which sent rates higher right after the election on optimism that tax reform and other Trump policies would lift the economy.""The market got a little hyped up initially. My sense is it's gone too far the other way,"" Schumacher said.Stock analysts say the equity market could see a pullback at some point, but few expect a sharp selloff this summer. Certainly, the stock market does not appear to fear a recession.""At some point, the bond market is going to be right because you have narrow leadership. At some point, those five or six stocks are going to run out of steam,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. Amazon.com, Netflix, and Alphabet, among others, have been powering ahead, helping to pull the stock indexes along with them. ""It's hard to pass the leadership from tech to the broader market until we get some answers on health care, and then it's going to be tax reform.""Hogan sees a very shallow sell-off of less than five percent.Analysts have said the 'Trump trades' related to tax reform and infrastructure have been priced out of specific stocks and sectors, but it's harder to determine how much the broader idea of a reflation trade is still boosting the overall market. The markets began factoring out a big pop from Trump policy in March when the first version of the health-care bill failed to reach a vote on Capitol Hill.As investigations heated up around the Trump campaign and Russia in recent weeks, optimism for any of Trump's growth policies seeing adoption this year faded even more. The  yield Wednesday slid to 2.19 percent, near the low end of a tight range it has traded in since the start of the year. The yield was at a low of 1.85 percent just before Trump won the election. The 10-year yield has gotten ever closer to the  yield, at 1.27 percent Wednesday. The convergence of the two \xe2\x80\x94 or flattening of the yield curve \xe2\x80\x94 is also a negative warning, and can be viewed as predicting concern about a weaker economy or that the Fed is raising rates too quickly.The 2-year yield directly reflects expectations for Fed rate-hiking activity.""If you're constructive on bonds, at least in the near term, that likely implies a pretty high chance of a recession starting in the middle of next year, and we're not of that view. But that's really what the market is telling you,"" said Cabana. The market is signaling a period of subdued growth with risks skewed to the downside, he said.""I've not gotten that sense that the bond market, the individuals, have a recession starting next year as a main point in their central scenario, but again that's what the levels would tell you, and in order for bond yields to go much lower from here, you've got to think the Fed is going to stop hiking,"" said Cabana, adding the market expects to see a very slow pace of rate hikes going forward. ""You're either in a recession or a prolonged period of slow increases in the fed funds target rate. \xe2\x80\xa6 That's not clearly what the Fed has indicated, and I think a lot of this has to do with different perception of fiscal policy and the underlying outlook for the U.S.""Cabana said he expects the Fed to raise rates in June and September before pausing to begin unwinding its balance sheet at the end of the year.Fed policy is also affecting both markets differently, according to Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at Lindsey Group.""It's the belief the Fed is going to raise rates, and it's a clear difference of opinion,"" said  Boockvar. He said the bond market is questioning whether the economy can handle rate hikes while the stock market is not. ""The bond market knows more often than not the Fed tightening cycle leads to recession. That's what history shows. I'm not saying it's going there but people in the bond market know that's where it could lead.""Boockvar noted that there are some telltale signs that the economy is cooling. For instance, car sales have peaked, commercial real estate is topping out, and lending is down, he said.The disparity between the two markets can also be explained by the fact that low bond yields have driven investors to equities and other assets that yield more.""Nasdaq going higher is led by a handful of stocks that are growing agnostic of the economy. The bond market looks more like the  and the  than it looks like the S&P.  If you look at the Transports they're sending the same message as the bond market: 'We're concerned about a slowdown,'"" said Hogan.The Russell 2000 is up just under 1 percent year-to-date, and the Dow Transports are up 1.3 percent. The Nasdaq is up 15.1 percent so far this year, and the S&P 500 is up 7.7 percent.""You've got a confusing message,"" said Hogan. He said the 10-year yield going lower often also means the market is reacting to geopolitical concerns, like the North Korean missile program, Brexit or the Italian election. Schumacher said the markets will be focused on a couple of events in the near future, and that could help resolve some market divergence. ""You have the employment report (Friday), the U.K. election on the 8th, and the Fed coming upon the 14th. Those are three things to focus on in the near term,"" he said. ""I think the bond market always thinks the stock market got it wrong, and vice versa,"" Schumacher said.

Here's what's newSquawk Box AsiaChina's yuan climbed to its highest levels since the fourth quarter of last year, despite a weak economic reading, as authorities reportedly tinker with currency policies.The offshore yuan, or CNH, rose, with the dollar fetching as little as 6.7229 yuan on Thursday, the weakest for the greenback since October \xe2\x80\x94 down from levels over 6.82 yuan last week.Onshore, the dollar was trading as low as 6.7830 , which was the U.S. currency's weakest since November, compared with levels above 6.86 yuan last week.The People's Bank of China's daily fixing was at 6.8090 on Thursday, the yuan's strongest since November, from 6.8633 on Wednesday, according to Reuters.Due to holidays, China's markets were closed on Monday and Tuesday, while Hong Kong's was shuttered on Tuesday.Even the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index falling to 49.6 in May \xe2\x80\x94 both below the 50.1 forecast from a Reuters poll and below the 50 level which indicates contraction \xe2\x80\x94 failed to dent the yuan rally.The Chinese currency's gains came as the CNH overnight interbank offered rate in Hong Kong spiked as high as 42.815 percent on Thursday, from 21.079 percent on Wednesday \xe2\x80\x94 up from 5.353 percent on May 29, according to Reuters data.Chinese yuan and dollarChina Photos | Getty Images The spikes in rates and the yuan came after China policymakers said last week they planned to change the methodology for setting the currency's daily fixing from one that was more market-based, relying heavily on the previous day's close and changes to a currency basket, to one that added a ""counter-cyclical adjustment"" factor.Further explanation wasn't provided, leaving those factors a mystery for speculators.Analysts said policymakers were likely signalling they didn't want the yuan to weaken further.""The consensus viewed the introduction of the counter-cyclical adjustment factor as signalling the PBOC's desire for a stronger yuan,"" Tim Condon, managing director at ING Financial, said in a Thursday note.""We thought the fixing formula tweak would 'work' eventually in persuading people that, like the rest of dollar/Asia ex-Japan, when the dollar depreciates against major currencies ( goes down), it should depreciate against the yuan,"" Condon said. ""But we thought it would take more than one session.""Others also noted that the change likely signalled the recent downtrend in the yuan could be at an end.""It is a further sign of reluctance at senior levels to allow prices to be set by market forces,"" Chang Liu and Mark Williams, economists at Capital Economics, said in a note on Wednesday. ""The key implication of the change to the fixing regime though would seem to be that officials are determined not to allow sizeable depreciation.""The economists said they expect the yuan to continue to appreciate against the dollar, expecially if the greenback weakens more broadly. They raised their year-end forecast for dollar/yuan to 6.90 from 7.10 and to 6.70 from 6.80 for the end of 2018.Other analysts also pointed to local banks stepping into the market to sop up yuan liquidity by selling dollars.""This immediately caught out investors who were initially wrong-footed by the deceptively high dollar/yuan fixing yesterday morning (relative to market's projections) and had chosen to go long the dollar/offshore yuan on this,"" analysts at Macquarie said in a note on Thursday. ""This ugly, yet familiar, cat-and-mouse game between authorities and investors highlights the perils of trading the onshore and offshore yuan; this is a key factor why we have repeatedly noted our distaste for trading yuan.""The yuan's level had become a campaign issue in the U.S., with then-candidate Donald Trump vowing to label the country a currency manipulator for the purposes of a competitive trade advantage and threatening to impose a tariff of as much as 45 percent on China's exports to the U.S.But analysts have long noted that the yuan was declining primarily due to dollar strength and that policymakers had actually appeared to be intervening in the market to prevent the renminbi from falling even further.President Trump later reversed himself, reneging on promises to label China a currency manipulator.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/heres-why-chinas-yuan-spiked-higher-despite-weak-caixin-pmi-data.html
323,"US reports oil exports rise to record level, just as OPEC agrees to cut back",Market Insider,01-06-2017,"The tanker Maria sails out of the Port of Corpus Christi after discharging crude oil at the Citgo refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas.Eddie Seal | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe U.S. oil industry exported a record 1.3 million barrels of crude per day onto the world market last week \xe2\x80\x94 just a half million barrels less than the cuts OPEC and Russia agreed to make to daily production.""I expect we're going to see new records set over the next six months as U.S. production continues to ramp up ... OPEC has become the swing producer of the world because other producers have figured out how to lower their costs and increase their efficiency and get more oil out of the ground profitably at $50 ... OPEC needs to just grit their teeth and wait for world oil demand to soak up the oversupply,"" said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates.OPEC, Russia and other producers extended their agreement just last week to curb output by 1.8 million barrels a day for another nine months, in an effort to force a rebalancing of the oil market. Crude prices have been soft since they struck the deal amid concerns the cuts are not deep enough to stem the flow of new oil from the U.S. and other sources, like Libya and Nigeria.The U.S. government also reported that domestic oil production increased to 9.34 million barrels a day from 9.32 million the week earlier, a sign that shale producers continue to ratchet up output even with oil floundering in the high $40s per barrel.U.S. refineries also upped their production, processing a record 17.51 million barrels of oil a day last week, topping a previous record of 17.29 million barrels set by the industry in April, according to the Energy Information Administration.U.S. drivers used 9.82 million barrels of gasoline a day, in the week ended just before the Memorial Day weekend, up from 9.7 million barrels in the week earlier. About 1.3 million barrels a \xc2\xa0day of distillates and more than 600,000 barrels a day of gasoline were also exported from the U.S.But analysts caution the weekly data from the EIA is tentative and could be revised when monthly data are released in several months. EIA also reported U.S. oil supplies dropped by 6.4 million barrels last week, a positive for the market and a much bigger decline than expected.""U.S. producers are stepping up to fill the gap left by OPEC and other non-OPEC producers,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital. ""It's going to a number of locations but increasingly Asia, where the real global battle for market share is on.""During the first quarter, the U.S. exported nearly 900,000 barrels of crude oil per day, which is more than the production that comes out of any of the four smallest OPEC producers \xe2\x80\x94 Qatar, Libya, Gabon or Ecuador, said Lipow.\xc2\xa0The U.S. barrels are going around the globe. ""They're going everywhere, they're going to Europe. They're going to Asia,"" he said.""What we've seen is that a lot of the increase in domestic production has been accommodated by an increase in refining capacity, making the U.S. a major gasoline and diesel supplier to world markets,"" said Lipow. ""U.S. refiners have added over 800,000 barrels a day of capacity since January\xc2\xa02015 and they're using it.""\xc2\xa0The EIA has monthly data on exports available through March only. The record month for exports was February, with 1.1 million barrels a day. In March, exports were 840,000 barrels a day, but in the last three months of 2016, exports averaged about 500,000 barrels per day.Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData, which tracks oil shipments, said his firm did not see 1.3 million barrels of oil exports from the U.S. last week. He said he expects the number was more like 850,000 barrels a day. A spokesman for the EIA said the data are tentative and based on data compiled by the Customs Department and Border Patrol.""We didn't see that high a volume. We're not sure the methodology of the EIA. We saw it a little bit lower. We saw it at 850,000. We track the Gulf Coast cargoes and some flows by pipeline as well. We're seeing it at about 850,000, all told. the EIA export number is fairly good when it's averaged out. On a week-to-week basis it is extremely volatile. It's potentially due to an extra cargo or two that bumped up that number,"" Smith said.He did say there's been a big increase in\xc2\xa0export loadings to Asia. Last year, just 7 percent of U.S. export loadings headed to Asia. This year that number has ramped up to 40 percent.The 1.3 million barrels a day reported by EIA for last week tops a record 1.2 million barrels per day exported in the week of Feb. 17. Surpassing a million barrels a day is uncommon and a milestone set just recently.\xc2\xa0Exports totaled 625,000 barrels a day in the prior week, and there was one other million-plus week in May, when 1.1 million barrels were exported in the week of May 12.""We know anecdotally that Asian buyers have been procuring supply deals with U.S. suppliers over the last several months,"" said Kilduff. ""There's actually been worries among Asian buyers that the OPEC deal would impact them and they've been picking up these purchases. That includes China, India and to a lesser extent South Korea.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/us-reports-oil-exports-rise-to-record-level-just-as-opec-agrees-to-cut-back.html

However, French, German and Italian officials said they do not believe the agreement can be renegotiated. The accord was the result of more than 20 years of negotiations, and the only countries in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that have not signed on to the deal are Syria and Nicaragua.Proponents of the deal expect it will help bolster businesses like those that Musk runs. Both electric cars and solar energy can be used to help reach the targets proposed in the deal. Musk isn't the only CEO who has pushed Trump to uphold the deal. Others include Apple and Microsoft. Silicon Valley investor Doug Derwin, who had pledged to spend up to $2 million of his own money on a campaign to pressure Musk to quit the councils, welcomed the news.

Jobs reportThe Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to publish its monthly employment report, which includes nonfarm payroll data and the unemployment rate, before the opening bell Friday. Schlossberg is keeping a close eye on this report as it's going to give investors further clarity as to whether the Federal Reserve may raise its federal funds target rate in September after likely hiking later this month.""The critical thing about the jobs report is whether the U.S. economy is really picking up steam in the second half as everybody expects it to, or whether it's starting to slow down,"" he said Thursday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""He will also be watching hourly wage growth, which has risen steadily but slowly over the last few years.""It is popular to say 'there is no wage growth.' It is a good story, but it is simply not true. If you take the average of the year-over-year change in the employment cost index, average hourly earnings, median weekly earnings and compensation per hour you can see that wages started going up in 2014. What is correct to say is that 'rates markets have decided to ignore the uptrend in wages,'"" Torsten Slok, Deutsche Bank's chief international economist, wrote in a note to clients Thursday morning.Economists surveyed by Reuters expect that nonfarm payrolls added 184,000 jobs last month. The unemployment rate is projected to hold steady at 4.4 percent, unchanged from last month's report. The previous report reflected the economy added 211,000 jobs, a figure that far surpassed expectations.2. Oil movementCrude  rallied early in the session Thursday on bullish inventory data before falling later in the day. Schlossberg is watching technical levels in oil carefully.WTI crude dipped below $48 per barrel late Thursday, the level Schlossberg said that, if broken to the downside, would give way ""to the $45 level. And that's a bad sign for the global economy.""The price of oil has slid more than 10 percent year to date even as OPEC has reiterated its focus on cutting global production.3. U.K. electionThe U.K. general election between British Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour Party candidate Jeremy Corbyn is set to take place next week. The latest polls show May losing some ground against her opponent. Schlossberg is watching closely as the election could prove to be a larger deal for American investors than they presently think.""Although it hasn't gotten that much attention here, U.K. elections could be a very big surprise for the market. Prime Minister May called snap elections on the assumptions that she's going to win a massive majority \xe2\x80\x93 but it's turning out to be a very tough race,"" Schlossberg said Thursday.""If indeed she doesn't win a big majority in the U.K. Parliament that could threaten U.K. assets,"" like the British pound, he added.The pound has been flat against the dollar since late April.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/jobs-data-and-crudes-key-level-heres-what-could-drive-the-market-on-friday.html

""While Trump supporters may cheer that he made good on a promise to pull out of the agreement, something he campaigned on, there's another part of his agenda that seems to have gone fallow that we care about here. Tax reform. It's fallen by the wayside because it requires the cooperation of Congress. And, at least right now, it almost feels like the White House has given up on Congress.""In fact, what Cramer called Washington's ""legislative logjam"" has thrown a wrench into a number of pro-business policies the Trump administration vowed to enact, including corporate tax reform, repatriation of cash from overseas, and health care reform.After meeting with a CEO of a company that pays a 31 percent federal tax rate, Cramer could not help but think of how much money that company would make if the rate were cut to 15 percent.Watch the full segment here:VIDEO7:3707:37Cramer takes down Trump's un-businesslike 'legislative logjam'Mad Money with Jim Cramer""Remember, that's the one ideological position we have on 'Mad Money': we're pro higher stock prices,"" Cramer said. ""If I thought tax reform was really on the table, I would've been pounding this stock to you, telling you you've got to buy it.""Instead, with the Russia probe, Trump's errant tweets, stalled health care reform, and the latest Paris accord development, that possibility now seems far-fetched.""There was a time when I would've pounded the table on the bank stocks after yesterday's drubbing because I believed that some of the most onerous regulations that have hamstrung banks from controlling their own destiny would be repealed by now,"" Cramer said.But now, trading weakness has overshadowed prospects of deregulation for the bank stocks, putting them in uneasy territory.Cramer even argued that Trump's deregulation efforts may actually be backfiring, as the commander in chief seems more focused on unraveling restraints on fossil fuels.""Trump's pushing fossil fuels all over the place, but coal just isn't economic versus natural gas in most parts of the country,"" Cramer said. ""Trump favors aggressive oil drilling, but all that will do is cause more of a glut and lower prices.

332,Express shares crater as tough times at the mall force retailer to trim outlook,Retail,01-06-2017,"Pedestrians walk past an Express Inc. store in New York, U.S., on Wednesday, May 31, 2017.Mark Kauziarich | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesExpress is fashion's latest victim.The retailer's shares sank on the heels of its disappointing first-quarter report Thursday. It closed at $6.27, down more than 19 percent.With Thursday's losses, the stock has tumbled more than 56 percent over the past 12 months and is down about 40 percent for the year-to-date period.First-quarter same-store sales, including those made on its e-commerce platform, fell 10 percent, compared to a 3 percent drop in the same period a year ago, Express said Thursday.""Like other apparel retailers, Express has been impacted by a decline in customer traffic to malls and in waning interest in apparel,"" GlobalData Retail analyst Hakon Helgesen wrote in an email.""This has a lot more to do with weak traffic issues than merchandise issues,"" Steven Marotta, a research analyst for C. L. King & Associates, told CNBC in an interview. ""People just don't go to the mall anymore.""VIDEO3:4403:44Lululemon soars on earnings, RH plummets after hoursFast MoneyThe million-dollar question is if this trend will continue for Express in the coming quarters, or if sales will start to pick up, Marotta said.""I think it hinges more on macroeconomic factors impacting consumers' spending on soft goods than it does Express' ability,"" he said.Marotta cited the fact that Express' e-commerce sales climbed 27 percent for the quarter. ""If they weren't doing those things right, people wouldn't be buying their stuff online.""Meanwhile, Express continues to close stores. During the first quarter it closed nine, and it will shutter an additional 11 stores by the end of this year.This is higher than the 10 closures Express had initially planned for the full year, ""and reflects the proactive approach we're taking in managing our fleet,"" the company said.Express reported an adjusted loss of 6 cents a share for the latest period, which included a loss of 3 cents per share related to ""certain discrete tax items"" and shuttering its Canadian stores, the company said. The adjusted earnings were short of a Thomson Reuters' forecast for a 3 cent loss.Sales fell 7 percent to $467 million from a year ago and missed a $467.9 million Thomson Reuters' forecast.The apparel chain said it now expects comparable sales for the year to be in the negative-low single digits, down from a previous estimate of flat-to-low single digits.""Our updated guidance reflects adjusted numbers excluding the impact from exiting Canada,"" CFO Perry Pericleous said on a call with analysts and investors. ""We expect our sales and market performance to improve as we move through the year. We also expect store traffic [to] remain challenging and the retail environment to remain promotional.""Express now expects to earn between 41 cents and 48 cents a share, on an adjusted basis, for the year, down sharply from a previous forecast of 65 cents to 73 cents a share.Industry report after industry report tells of slowing customer traffic and predicts the closure of more malls. This week, Credit Suisse estimated 25 percent of all U.S. malls will need to close by 2022. Part of this is fueled by the growing threat from Amazon.com.""However, in the case of Express, these prevailing trends are made worse because the chain has weak visibility, even among its target demographics,"" Helgesen wrote. ""It is not a brand that is foremost of mind and so is particularly reliant on passing footfall to bolster trade.""Express has been trying to address these issues with its product and by improving the experience of shopping with the retailer.On its earnings conference call, the company said its efforts were ""gaining traction,"" and it highlighted what separates it from e-commerce giant Amazon. ""We can create a curated assortment for the customer with a very specific fashion point of view, which is more difficult for someone like Amazon to do,"" CEO David Kornberg said on the earnings conference call.""We also have bricks-and-mortar stores and have a better opportunity to create a better customer experience than they do at this point. So those are things that are in our favor in ways we can combat Amazon longer term,"" he said.Also, Express has stepped up its marketing efforts by partnering with supermodel Karlie Kloss in a spring advertising campaign.But GlobalData Retail's Helgesen said he doesn't expect the current marketing efforts ""go far enough in giving Express the distinct personality or point of view that it needs to thrive in the crowded apparel market ... There is much more work to do to inject energy into a brand that is still somewhat lifeless.""EXPR 12-month performanceSource: FactSetWatch: A tale of two retailersVIDEO2:4302:43JILL & KORS: A tale of two retailersPower Lunch",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/express-reports-sales-are-slumping-slashes-full-year-outlook.html

Look at Decluttr, USell, Gazelle, NextWorth and Swappa.To narrow down the places that might be best for you to sell, make sure you're looking at the following:How many customers/unique visitors the site/app gets each month. They may publicize this information on their website, or you could ask via a site contact form.How long it takes to make a sale on average. Ask customer service if information isn't available on website.Your take-home percentage of the sale. Obviously more is better, but if the merchandise doesn't move, it's meaningless.How and when you'll get paid.

You don't have to be a professional writer, but it helps to get creative. One woman selling a couch on my neighborhood sales Facebook group said her sectional would be great for hosting friends for the Big Game. Be as specific as you can, including how big the item is, who makes it, what you paid for it originally, and what it's selling for today.Be honest. Not only is revealing an item's faults (like a stain or a small rip) upfront the right thing to do, but it'll also save you time and disappointment later (like if the buyer declines or sends the item back).Make sure the price is right. Consignment stores usually price merchandise at about one-third of retail price. That's about right for selling via these methods as well. If your item doesn't move quickly, lower the price until it does.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/one-in-four-americans-has-a-clutter-problem--and-could-be-sitting-on-some-serious-cash.html

Critics also complain the deal holds countries like China and India to a lower standard and forces the U.S. to sacrifice its sovereignty.U.S. business interests are best served by a stable and practical framework facilitating an effective and balanced global response.

Trump and Republicans have started rolling back many of those policies.But even some coal producers like Cloud Peak Energy and Peabody Energy argued the U.S. should remain a party in order to negotiate coal's future in the global energy mix.Many investors have also advised the president to keep the U.S. in the accord. Last month, 214 institutional investors with $15 trillion of assets under management pushed Trump to implement the U.S. commitment, which aims to reduce the nation's greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.""As long-term institutional investors, we believe that the mitigation of climate change is essential for the safeguarding of our investments,"" they said.Watch: Musk urges Trump to stay in Paris AgreementVIDEO1:3101:31Elon Musk: We'll depart White House councils if US leaves Paris AccordPower Lunch",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/why-ceos-want-trump-to-keep-the-us-in-the-paris-agreement.html

The Australians explained that they had no intention of changing their laws or rules in ways that could increase drug prices. Price and Kline continued pushing, according to the aide, asking for a side letter or other written guidance that the period would be extended in Australia even if it weren't spelled out in the TPP itself.Price's lobbying abroad, which has not previously been reported, is  another example of how his work in Congress could have benefitted his  investment portfolio. He traded hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of shares in health-related companies while taking action on legislation and regulations affecting the industry. ProPublica  previously reported that Price's stock trades are said to be under investigation by federal prosecutors.Price, who did not respond to an interview request for this story, has said he did nothing wrong, that his broker generally chose stocks without his knowledge and that all of his trades were publicly disclosed.Price's financial disclosures submitted to the House Office of the Clerk show that on March 17, 2016, he purchased shares worth between $1,000 and $15,000 each in Eli Lilly, Amgen, Bristol-Meyers Squibb, McKesson, Pfizer and Biogen. All six companies had an interest in biological drugs, which are grown from live cells and are known for short as biologics. Eli Lilly, for example, is behind Portrazza, the first biologic approved to treat a common type of lung cancer. Amgen makes a top-seller for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Biogen developed a biologic for people suffering multiple sclerosis relapses.Kline, who has since retired from Congress, said he could not recall if he or anyone else raised the biologics issue. His financial disclosures do not show direct holdings in pharmaceutical companies.Australia has played another role in Price's financial activities. In 2015 the congressman bought about $10,000 worth of shares in Innate Immunotherapeutics, a small biologics firm with an office in Sydney. After the congressional trip, which also made a stop in Sydney, Price purchased a larger stake in the company, about  $84,000 worth, in two private placements, the first of which was announced in June. Price was invited to purchase the shares at a discounted rate.It's not known if Price had any contact with the firm while in Sydney. Price didn't respond to questions about when and where he discussed the discounted offering with company officials. The company's officials also did not respond.Traveling congressional delegations typically meet with a variety of local officials, and at the time of the visit to Australia it wasn't unusual for Republican lawmakers to side with the pharmaceutical industry on the trade deal's protections for biologics. Price's advocacy stands out because he pushed the cause directly with foreign officials, while at the same time owning stakes in companies that could have benefited.An itinerary for the trip reviewed by ProPublica mentions TPP in relation to one of the meetings, but does not list the biologics provision. A former Australian trade official, who asked not to be named and attended one of the meetings, confirmed that the 12-year lockup was addressed, but said he could not recall which Congress members were pushing it.Others on the trip, organized by the House's  Education and the Workforce Committee, were Robert Scott, D-Va., Ruben Hinojosa, D-Texas, Erik Paulsen, R-Minn. and Dan Benishek, R-Mich. Those members who responded to requests for comment said they could not recall whether the provision was discussed.The data collected during clinical trials of drugs can save competitors time in developing the cheaper alternatives to biologics known as biosimilars. Keeping the data proprietary longer extends the original drugmaker's monopoly. While some big brand-name pharmaceutical companies also make biosimilars, they and their trade association \xe2\x80\x94 the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America \xe2\x80\x94 advocated strongly for longer exclusivity.In the end, the debate over the provision became moot. Trump scrapped the TPP days after taking office. Price divested his drug stocks upon taking the cabinet post. His investment in Innate Immunotherapeutics yielded a  profit of at least $150,000.

343,"Changes coming to bank stress tests, Fed's Powell says",Finance,01-06-2017,"VIDEO3:5603:56Powell: Could see two more rate hikes in 2017Squawk on the StreetThe Federal Reserve will be making some of its own changes to the way it regulates banks, ahead of a likely push from the Trump administration to loosen up post-financial crisis rules.Fed Governor Jerome ""Jay"" Powell told CNBC in an interview Thursday that upcoming stress test results will come with communication from central bank regulators on those changes.""We're committed to running as transparent as possible and effective as possible set of stress tests,"" Powell said. ""They are very successful, very important post-crisis innovations and we want to continue to strengthen that.""Though most U.S. banks have been passing the tests on a regular basis, they have criticized the process as cumbersome and lacking clear direction.""We do hear the complaints and we are working now as we have continuously to provide more information, more transparency,"" Powell said.For instance, he added that the Fed will be providing ""much more granular information"" about how banks should be reporting loss rates for certain corporate loans. In addition, he said regulators will be seeking public input about how to improve the process. It's all part of a process to review how things have been going since the financial crisis. Big Wall Street banks were the epicenter of crisis, with too much leverage and too little capital for protection once a wave of mortgage defaults set off a liquidity crisis. Congress in 2011 adopted the Dodd-Frank reforms that changed the way banking was done in the U.S. across a number of fronts. The new law increased capital requirements and limited risk-taking activities, such as banks trading for their own accounts.Now that much of that dust has cleared, Powell believes it's time to take a look at how all of the changes worked.President Donald Trump has targeted Dodd-Frank for substantial changes, and even said during last year's campaign that he'd like to scrap the law entirely. His administration currently has the law under review for changes.""I would say that the post-crisis reform program has been mostly completed and has mostly been successful,"" Powell said. ""I think it's our obligation now as we reach completion of it to look back over it and ask what aspects of it may be redundant, inefficient, or utterly essential and should be protected down to every letter.""One part likely to undergo changes is the co-called Volcker Rule, which restricts banks from trading for their own benefit. The rule almost certainly will be removed or amended, and Powell said the thinks there ways to make it ""less burdensome"" in how it is implemented.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/changes-coming-to-bank-stress-tests-feds-powell-says.html

345,"Bitcoin may hit $4,000 by the end of the year: Analyst",Tech Transformers,01-06-2017,"VIDEO4:0404:04Bitcoin is emerging as digital gold: ProSquawk Box EuropeThe digital currency  is currently still near all-time highs, but bullish calls remain for the asset. One investor thinks it could almost double to $4,000 by the end of 2017.Bitcoin hit an all-time high in late May, reaching to $2791.70 according to CoinDesk data, recording a 180 percent rally year-to-date. There was a subsequent price correction towards $2,100 but bitcoin currently stands around $2,468.56. The market cap for bitcoin has swelled to more than $40 billion.The bitcoin rally has been fueled by several causes:Japan passed a law in April recognizing the digital currency as a legal method of payment, leading to a surge in demand from Asian countries.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing a decision regarding approval for a bitcoin-based exchange traded fund proposed by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, known for their lawsuit against Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.Other countries, including Russia, are looking at how to regulate bitcoin in order to tax it, but this could further stimulate demand for the cryptocurrency as it becomes legitimized.Daniel Masters is the chairman of XBT Provider, which offers a ""bitcoin tracker"" that can be traded and exchanged on the Nasdaq exchange in Stockholm. He expects Bitcoin to reach $4,000 by the end of the year.""Bitcoin is emerging as the transactional layer of the internet, as programmable money and as digital gold. That's the big picture,"" he told CNBC's Squawk Box on Thursday.Masters says the trend for high volatility in bitcoin is being diminished due to bitcoin's proliferation, with more products and exchanges set up, as well as the development of a short side of the market. He thinks the next catalysts for bitcoin price growth will come from greater volume.""What we've seen at XBT Provider is an increase in coverage and an increase in penetration into both the retail and institutional market. We're now being covered on Nasdaq OMX by 27 different broker dealers, and that is a stark increase from what we saw a year or two ago,"" he said.A Bitcoin conference in New York.Getty ImagesGarrick Hileman, economic historian at the University of Cambridge and London School of Economics, agreed that recent developments are increasing demand for bitcoin.""Macroeconomic and positive regulatory developments are fueling significant demand in many markets, particularly South Korea and Japan, as well as India, Venezuela, Nigeria, and elsewhere,"" he told CNBC via email on Thursday.However, he raised concerns about the potential split that faces the digital currency. The bitcoin community is debating how to fix a scaling issue, as the number of bitcoin transactions that can happen at any one time is limited and causes a backlog of transactions.One solution is to increase the size of the blocks on the blockchain in order to process more transactions, but this would involve splitting the blockchain, causing a fork and creating two major blockchains, which would effectively create two different coins.""A successful resolution of the bitcoin scaling debate would likely propel the currency to new highs. However, if the bitcoin ecosystem divides then the price could plummet,"" Hileman warned.""The frothiness we are observing in the initial coin offering market right now may trigger a regulatory backlash, which could negatively impact bitcoin's price,"" he added.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/bitcoin-may-hit-4000-by-the-end-of-the-year-analyst.html
346,"European Union details its deeper integration, wants common finance minister and bundled euro zone debt",Europe News,01-06-2017,"Carl Court | Getty ImagesThe European Commission put forward proposals on further euro zone integration on Wednesday as a response to the rising populist sentiment across the union.The EU's executive body resurfaced previous proposals for a common finance minister and a new bond market to manage debt, which bundles national debts into one asset. However, such proposals, if successful, would only be fully in place by 2025, the commission's paper said.Valdis Dombrovskis, vice-president of the European Commission, said that the EU should not wait for another crisis to deepen economic and monetary policies to strengthen the resilience of the euro area.""We need to move forward now,"" Dombrovskis told reporters on Wednesday.According to the European Commission, a fully integrated economic and monetary union would need a Treasury led by a EU finance minister, who could chair the meetings of the euro zone finance ministers \xe2\x80\x93 currently known as the Eurogroup.""Everything would depend on the responsibilities and powers such a euro zone finance minister would receive,"" Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING, told CNBC via email. ""Would be a representative role or would it come together with a euro zone budget,"" he wondered.A high-ranking EU official, who often attends Eurogroup meetings, told CNBC last week that having a common minister seems unlikely in the near term. He explained that the current Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who's also the Dutch finance minister, gathers significant support among the other finance ministers but failed to get enough backing to continue with his European role after having lost the general election, putting an end, at least for now, to the idea of a permanent president. No Eurobonds Jason Alden | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe commission's discussion also suggested sovereign bond-backed securities to make bank's balance sheets more diversified and interconnected.""These financial instruments \xe2\x80\xa6 are securitized financial products that could be issued by a commercial entity or an institution,"" the commission said, highlighting that ""there would be no debt mutualization between member states.""Some argue that such options would allow more-troubled economies to keep borrowing at low costs in a scenario where the European Central Bank would stop its quantitative easing program.The Commission already under the presidency of Jean-Claude Juncker had suggested in 2015 that there should be common eurobonds. However, some countries have opposed this idea. Germany, for example, doesn't want to lose its credit rating to prop up troubled euro zone economies.Focusing for now on debt securitization would mean that it would not be necessary to interfere with national government's debt issuances.""Securitization simply means that you take the existing bonds on the market, e.g. German, French, Italian and Spanish, and 'securitize' them in a tranched bond,"" Claus Vistesen, euro zone economist at Patheon Macroeconomics, told CNBC.""In this new security, the bonds of the individual states would exist independently. So for example if you bought a bond with 25 percent of each of the major economies, and Italy defaulted, you would still be paid on the remaining 75 percent, presumably at least,"" he added.This idea could therefore gather some more support in Germany, given that in opposition to eurobonds, a country would still be able to default.Franco-German willingnessGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel and newly-elected French President Emmanuel Macron attend a press conference at the Chancellery on May 15, 2017 in Berlin, Germany.Axel Schmidt | Getty ImagesAbove all Wednesday's paper intended to boost the EU, as populism spreads and as negotiations with London start for the U.K.'s exit from the Union.The newly elected and pro-European French President, Emmanuel Macron, met Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany in Berlin in mid-May. At the time both said that they wanted to move further with euro zone integration.""There is a common conviction that we cannot only deal with Britain's exit (from the EU), but instead that we must above all think about how we can deepen the existing European Union and especially the euro zone,"" Merkel told reporters.While EU officials have talked up integration there is doubt Berlin would back the pooling of debt or national governments' ability to raise money.""Latest comments from Merkel and Macron have given hope that the Franco-German axis could really revive further integration of the euro zone. However, the coming days will show whether it was only words or whether particularly the Germans are willing to put their money where their mouth is,"" Brzeski added.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

Highlights can be posted to be viewed by all or by select folks. Sound familiar? That's because it's exactly what Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook already offer. Crowded market for sharing our lives, isn't it?Skype isn't losing its heart, though, which is video connectivity between friends. That's still there. Let's take a look at what's new but, before we do, a quick note that this is only rolling out to Android now and will be available for iPhones soon.This is the first screen you'll see after signing in. You can choose either a colorful chat theme or a black and white one. I'm going colorful.Todd Haselton | CNBCNow you'll choose another color. I'm not sure how this differs from the first option but here we go.Todd Haselton | CNBCHere's the new home screen. It's split into Highlights (the stories you and your friends can share), chats and capture.

There are also chat add-ons, though not many. Giphy is probably the most fun, or YouTube.Todd Haselton | CNBCSkype desperately needed this refresh. While Microsoft has worked to improve it over recent years, it felt stale in comparison with WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.The Snapchat-like features are neat, but I really don't think anyone is going to use them. Maybe I'm wrong, but with Instagram and Snapchat already owning that market, I don't see much of a reason to come here to share parts of your day.Todd Haselton | CNBCIt works well though, and that's really all that matters if Microsoft wants to try to create a base of users.

351,Full transcript: Hillary Clinton at Code 2017,Politics,01-06-2017,"Editor's note: The following is a lightly edited transcript of former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's appearance at the 2017 Code Conference. Below, we've embedded the full audio of the interview from our podcast Recode Replay and the full video. We're posting all the other sessions from Code to that feed on  Apple Podcasts,  Google Play Music, Spotify (mobile only), TuneIn and Stitcher.Kara Swisher: So now, we're going to do an interview we're very excited about. Walter, why don't you ...Walt Mossberg: Uh, we are just ... I'm just going to do it. Hillary Clinton.[applause, cheers, Katy Perry plays, laughter]Swisher: I think they voted for you, I think they did, a lot of these people [HRC laughs]. Before we start, there's a distillery in Washington, D.C. and I've heard you like whiskey.Mossberg: There is? In Washington?Swisher: Yes, there's a new distillery.Hillary Clinton: I've been known to, yeah, right [laughter].Swisher: So we brought you Rodham Rye [HRC laughs], which is \xe2\x80\x94 people see it? \xe2\x80\x94 it's actually Hillary Clinton rye made for you.Yes, that's what they told me.Swisher: And if you'd like a drink at anytime during this ... [laughter].Well ...Mossberg: We brought cups.Swisher: Now let's just get the alt right platform \xe2\x80\x94 Hillary Clinton has a drinking problem [HRC laughs]. But if you'd like a drink at any point, this is for you to take home.Well you know, it may depend upon how the interview goes.Swisher: Ok, all right. We'll just put it right here, just go, ""Give me a shot.""Yeah, but I was thrilled. I mean, hey, not in the White House but Rodham Rye is on the shelves. [laughter]Swisher: All right, great!Mossberg: It seems like a fair trade-off, I don't know.Well, you know, you gotta take what you can get.VIDEO5:0005:00Swisher: Facebook has to clean themselves upClosing BellMossberg: So, we're going to talk a lot about tech and politics and tech in our country, your views on it. We were talking backstage and I think this was the first election where tech sort of got weaponized in a way that directly affected the outcome of the election ...I agree.Mossberg: ... and I know you have stuff to say about it. But I have to ask you first, discounting all those outside forces which were obviously very important, what misjudgement did you make, and your staff, that thinking about it was something serious and that you wish you had done the opposite?Well you know, I'm writing a whole book, Walt ...Mossberg: Well I don't want to wait for the book.Yeah, we don't probably have enough time for everything, but look. The overriding issue that affected the election that I had any control over \xe2\x80\x94 because I had no control over the Russians, too bad about that, but we'll talk about it, I hope \xe2\x80\x94 was the way that the use of my email account was turned into the biggest scandal since lord knows when. And you know, in the book I'm just using everything that anybody else said about it besides me to basically say this was the biggest nothing-burger ever. It was a mistake, I've said it was a mistake, and obviously if I could turn the clock back, I wouldn't have done it in the first place, but the way that it was used was very damaging.Swisher: And you didn't handle it? That's a mistake on your part? Or they way it was used was a mistake on your part? Because we're trying to get at what you think you misjudged.Well, if you went all the way back, doing something that others had done before was no longer acceptable in the new environment in which we found ourselves. And there was no law against it, there was no rule, nothing of that sort. So I didn't break any rule, nobody said, ""Don't do this,"" and I was very responsible and not at all careless. So you end up with a situation that is then exploited, and very effectively, for adverse political reasons. And it was maddening, because in the middle of a hard-fought campaign, it's hard to stop and say, ""Wait a minute, what you think you know about this is not accurate, let me tell you. You can still judge me, you can still hold me accountable, that's fair game."" But there was so much else going on at that time.And the investigation that they conducted ended in July, it was over, and I have my complaints about former director Comey, but it was done. And then it was reignited and it became the major reason toward the end, based on the best analysis that I can find, that I lost ground and ended up losing. So obviously, turn the clock back. But what was done, and I think it was interesting, I know you had Dean Baquet here from the New York Times yesterday, and they covered it like it was Pearl Harbor. And then in their endorsement of me, they said, ""This email thing, it's like a help desk issue."" So it was always a hard issue to put to bed, but we put it to bed in July and then it rose up again.VIDEO0:3700:37Clinton: I'm not going anywhereClosing BellMossberg: Okay, I want to do one more of these misjudgement things and then we're going to go on. Goldman Sachs.Yeah.Mossberg: You knew you were going to run for president, or you thought you might, or probably, you were thinking about it \xe2\x80\x94 you had to be thinking about it as a possibility \xe2\x80\x94 why did you do those?Why do you have Goldman Sachs here? [laughter]Swisher: Because they pay us.They paid me [laughter and applause]. You know, look, again ...Mossberg: Let's get serious ...But ...Mossberg: I know they paid you ...Yes.Mossberg: And they paid you a lot.Yes, yes.Mossberg: But you're not somebody who needed that money for the next week's shopping, and you knew you might run, so why do it?Well, I gave speeches to many, many groups. I spoke to camp counselors, I spoke to health-care executives, I spoke to, you know, just a wide range of groups, right? And not just in the United States but particularly in Canada and a few other places.And I was a Senator from New York. I knew these people and I knew what they did for the economy and I knew what they did to the economy. And I think that speaking to them, raising questions \xe2\x80\x94 which I did in 2008 and 2009 \xe2\x80\x94 you know, people have no reason to know this, but in the 2008 campaign before the Iowa caucus, I actually ran an ad about the looming mortgage crisis. So I have to say, Walt, I never thought that anybody would throw out my entire career of standing up and speaking out and voting against and voting in favor of what I thought are good policies, because I made a couple of speeches. When you're the Secretary of State, people want to hear what you talk about. The most common thing that I talked about in all those speeches was the hunt for Bin Laden. You know, that was one of the central missions that I felt from the time the towers fell on 9/11 as a Senator from New York.And to be part of that, to be one of the very few people advising the president on that, that was a fascinating issue. And I thought I could tell that to a lot of different people, and you know, men got paid for the speeches they made. I got paid for the speeches I made. And it was used, and I thought it was unfairly used and all of that, but it was part of the background music.Swisher: So let's talk about that ... but it was used. And I think we've discussed this, you and I have discussed this, this idea of ... how many years did you talk about the vast right-wing conspiracy?Um, about ... let's see, it was probably '98?Swisher: And at the time people thought you were ...A little crazy [laughter].Swisher: Right, okay. [WM laughs]. What is it like now? How do you look at it now? Because it is used. Because you're someone that's got to know that a target's on your back almost every... You know, right now every bot in Russia is working their way with the last 20 seconds of things you said.Yes, right. Well I hope we get into this because look, I take responsibility for every decision I made, but that's not why I lost. So I think it's important that we learn the real lessons from this last campaign because the forces that we are up against are not just interested in influencing our elections and our politics, they're going after our economy and they're going after our unity as a nation. So yes, back in '98 \xe2\x80\x94 look, I have been watching this and have been, obviously, the target for a number of years. And what is hard for people to really \xe2\x80\x94 although now after the election there's greater understanding \xe2\x80\x94 is that there are forces in our country \xe2\x80\x94 put the Russians to one side \xe2\x80\x94 who have been fighting rear-guard actions for as long as I've been alive, because my life coincided with the Civil Rights movement, with the Women's Rights movement, with anti-war protesting, with the impeachment ... you know, the driving out of office because he was about to be impeached president ...VIDEO5:5305:53Clinton: I never said I ran a perfect campaignClosing BellSwisher: Let's be specific.Yeah, let's be very specific as if people didn't understand what I was saying [laughter].And let's talk about, you know, Watergate and all the stuff that we lived through. And we were on a real roll as a country despite assassinations, despite setbacks. You know, opening the doors of opportunity, expanding rights to people who never had them in any country, was frankly thrilling. And I believed then, and I believe now, that we're never done with this work. And so part of the challenge is to maintain the energy and the focus to keep going forward. But you've got to recognize the other side is never, never tired either. They're always looking to push back.And what we saw was, in the election particularly, and I appreciate what Walt said, the first time that you had the tech revolution really weaponized politically \xe2\x80\x94 before it was a way to reach voters, you know, collect fundraising, do things that would help the candidate who was behind the messaging \xe2\x80\x94 that changed this time, and it changed for a number of reasons we should talk about. You had Citizens United come to its full fruition. So unaccountable money flowing in against me, against other Democrats, in a way that we hadn't seen and then attached to this weaponized information war. You had effective suppression of votes. Those of us who can remember the Voting Rights Act, the expansion of the franchise, and then I was in the Senate when we voted 98 to nothing under a Republican president, George W. Bush, to extend the Voting Rights Act.And the Supreme Court said, ""Oh, we don't need it anymore,"" throws it out, and Republican governors and legislatures began doing everything they could to suppress the vote. So, that was before we get to the Russians, or Cambridge Analitica, or anything of the outside. And there were lots of factors at work and yeah, it was aimed at me, but it's a much deeper, more persistent effort to try to literally turn the clock back on so much of what we've achieved as a country.Swisher: So talk about the weaponizing of it. Because one of the things that's interesting ... Now you've recently, and we've talked about the uses of Facebook, the uses of \xe2\x80\x94 we can get into Donald Trump's Twitter thing in a second, because that can be a whole conference, essentially. But how do you see how it was weaponized, and it begs the questions, why weren't you weaponizing it? Like, why is the right wing so good at it?Mossberg: And not just you, but the Democrats.Well, look. Here's how I see it, and I hope others will jump into this debate in the months ahead because there's a lot we have to understand if we're going to avoid this continuing assault on our sources of information. Here's how I think about it. You know, I was very proud of my data and analytics team. They were largely veterans of the Obama campaigns, '08, '12, and then we brought in new people and brought in a lot of new expertise to build the next generation. And we had a lot of help from some people in Silicon Valley as well. And what we thought we were doing \xe2\x80\x94 here's the arena we were playing in \xe2\x80\x94 was going to like Obama 3.0, you know, better targeting, better messaging, and the ability to both turn out our voters as we identified them, and to communicate more broadly with voters.Here's what the other side was doing, and they were in a different arena. Through content farms, through an enormous investment in falsehoods, fake news, call it what you will ...Mossberg: How about ""lies""?Lies? You're really ... that's a good word too [laughter and applause]. The other side was using content that was just flat-out false, and delivering it in a very personalized way, both sort of above the radar screen and below. And you know, look, I'm not a tech expert by any stretch of the imagination. That really influenced the information that people were relying on. And there have been some studies done since the election that if you look \xe2\x80\x94 let's pick Facebook. If you look at Facebook, the vast majority of the news items posted were fake. They were connected to, as we now know, the 1,000 Russian agents who were involved in delivering those messages.They were connected to the bots that are just out of control. We see now this new information about Trump's Twitter account being populated by millions of bots. And it was such a new experience. I understand why people on their Facebook pages would think, ""Oh, Hillary Clinton did that, I did not know that. Well that's going to affect my opinion about her."" And we did not engage in false content. We may have tried to put every piece of information in the best possible light, and explanations, but we weren't in the same category as the other side.Mossberg: But, okay. So you weren't going to lie.Right.Mossberg: Good for you.Well ... Yes ... [laughter]Mossberg: I see you're rethinking that [laughs].I'm not rethinking it, but everybody else better rethink it, because we have to figure out how to combat this.Mossberg: Okay, but that's my point. My impression is that the left, the Democrats, liberals, whatever you want to call them, including Bernie Sanders's folks and everybody on the Democratic side, which at once time, 12, 15 years ago, was ahead of the Republicans on tech as it existed then, is way behind now.Yeah, yeah.Mossberg: And it's not just ... I mean, there's a way to weaponize tech that doesn't involve lying.Right.Mossberg: Or having Russians help you. But it is a political weapon, it's a fact of life now.Swisher: So how do you do that?Mossberg: How do you do it? How do we do it going forward?Let me just do a comparison for you. I set up my campaign and we have our own data operation. I get the nomination. So I'm now the nominee of the Democratic Party. I inherit nothing from the Democratic Party.Mossberg: What do you mean nothing?I mean it was bankrupt, it was on the verge of insolvency, its data was mediocre to poor, nonexistent, wrong. I had to inject money into it ...VIDEO5:2505:25Clinton: Democrats can take the House backClosing BellMossberg: This is the DNC you're talking about.The DNC, to keep it going. Okay. Donald Trump, who did nothing about really setting up any kind of data operation, inherits an RNC data foundation that, after the Republicans lost in 2012, and they thought they had a very good operation with the setup that Romney did called ORCA, they thought that was really state of the art, they lose.So they raised \xe2\x80\x94 best estimates are close to a hundred million dollars, they brought in their main vendors, they basically said, ""We will never be behind the Democrats again,"" and they invested between 2012 and 2016 this hundred million dollars to build this data foundation. They beta tested it. They ran it ... somebody was able to determine about 227,000 surveys to double check, triple check, quadruple check, the information.So Trump becomes the nominee and he is basically handed this tried and true, effective foundation. Then you've got Cambridge Analytica and you know, you can believe the hype on how great they were or the hype on how they weren't, but the fact is, they added something. And I think again, we better understand that the Mercers did not invest all that money just for their own amusement. We know they played in Brexit, and we know that they came to Jared Kushner and basically said, ""We will marry our operation,"" which was more as it's been described, psychographic, sentiment, a lot of harvesting of Facebook information, ""We will marry that with the RNC on two conditions: You pick Steve Bannon, and you pick Kellyanne Conway. And then we're in."" Trump says, ""Fine, who cares,"" right? So Bannon, who'd been running the Breitbart operation, supplying a lot of the ... untrue, false stories ...Mossberg: You gotta start saying lies.Yeah. We know. So, they married content with delivery and data. And it was a potent combination. Now, the question is, where and how did the Russians get into this? And I think it's a very important question. So, I assume that a lot of people here may have \xe2\x80\x94 and if you haven't, I hope you will \xe2\x80\x94 read the declassified report by the Intelligence community that came out in early January.Mossberg: This is 17 agencies ...Seventeen agencies, all in agreement, which I know from my experience as a Senator and Secretary of State, is hard to get. They concluded with high confidence that the Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign, to influence voters in the election. They did it through paid advertising we think, they did it through false news sites, they did it through these thousand agents, they did it through machine learning, which you know, kept spewing out this stuff over and over again. The algorithms that they developed. So that was the conclusion. And I think it's fair to ask, how did that actually influence the campaign? And how did they know what messages to deliver?Swisher: Who told them?Who told them? Who were they coordinating with, or colluding with? Because the Russians historically in the last couple of decades and then increasingly, you know, are launching cyber attacks, and they are stealing vasts amounts of information, and a lot of the information they've stolen they've used for internal purposes, to affect markets, to affect the intelligence services, etc. So this is different because they went public, and they were conveying this weaponized information and the content of it, and they were running ... You know, there's all these stories of guys over in Macedonia who are running these fake news sites and I've seen them now and you sit there and it looks like a sort of low-level CNN operation ...Mossberg: Or a fake newspaper.Or a fake newspaper ...Mossberg: Like the Denver Guardian.Like a fake newspaper, and so the Russians \xe2\x80\x94 in my opinion and based on the intel and the counterintel people I've talked to \xe2\x80\x94 could not have known how best to weaponize that information unless they had been guided.Mossberg: Guided by Americans.Guided by Americans and guided by people who had polling and data information.Swisher: Who is that?Now let me just finish, because this is the second and third step. So we know that they did that. We understand it. Best example: So within one hour, one hour of the Access Hollywood tapes being leaked, within one hour, the Russians \xe2\x80\x94 let's say WikiLeaks, something \xe2\x80\x94 dumped the John Podesta emails. Now, if you've ever read the John Podesta emails, they are anodyne to boredom [laughter]. But ...Mossberg: Yeah, we had him here once.Yeah, [laughter and applause], and forgive him for what he said about you. So, they were run-of-the-mill emails, especially run of the mill for a campaign.""Should we do this?"" ""What should she say?"" You know, just the stuff that is so common, basic. Within one hour they dumped them, and then they began to weaponize them. And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world, like Infowars, take out pieces and begin to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you could imagine. And so they had to be ready for that, and they had to have a plan for that, and they had to be given the go-ahead. ""Okay, this could be the end of the Trump campaign, dump it now. And then let's do everything we can to weaponize it.""And we know it hurt us. Because as I explain in my book, you know, the Comey letter, which was, now we know, partly based on a false memo from the Russians. It was a classic piece of Russian disinformation \xe2\x80\x94 comprimat, they call it. So, for whatever reason, and I speculate, but I can't look inside the guy's mind, you know, he dumps that on me on October 28th, and I immediately start falling. But what was really interesting, since the mainstream media covered that, as I say like Pearl Harbor, front pages everywhere, huge type, etc. And all of the Trump people go around screaming, ""Lock her up, lock her up,"" and all of that. At the same time, the biggest Google searches were not for Comey, because that information was just lying out there, it was for WikiLeaks. And so voters who are being targeted with all of this false information are genuinely trying to make up their minds.What does it mean? And we know that the Google searches for this stuff were particularly high in places in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.Swisher: So, a couple of questions to this. That was fascinating actually. I was like riveted to that. Who was directing them, from your perspective? And do you blame \xe2\x80\x94 and I'm just going to use Facebook, because that's where a lot of this was done, especially around the fake news, either the Pope was voting for Trump, or there was one particular one I got in an argument with Facebook people about, you being a lizard, that was going around. And they kept arguing about the gray area and this and that, and I remember being in a call saying, ""She's not a lizard!""Thank you, Kara, thank you [laughter].Mossberg: That's actually a kind thing from Kara.I'm very touched!Swisher: But ... [laughter] do you blame ...I have that on a pillow, ""She's not a lizard.""Swisher: I don't know if you're a lizard or not but ... [HRC laughs] I'm guessing you're not a lizard. But who do you think directed it? And do you blame Facebook, or any of these platforms, for doing nothing? What should they have done and are they culpable?Let me separate out the questions. First, we're getting more information about all of the contacts between Trump campaign officials and Trump associates with Russians before, during and after the election. So I hope that we'll get enough information to be able to answer that question.Swisher: But you're leaning Trump.Yes ... yes. I'm leaning Trump. I think it's pretty hard not to. I think that the marriage of the domestic fake news operations, the domestic RNC Republican allied data, you know, combined with the very affective capabilities that the Russians brought. You know, basically the group running this was the GRU which is the military intelligence arm of the Russian military and they have a very sophisticated cyber operation, in bed with WikiLeaks, in bed with Goosefer, in bed with DC Leaks.And you know, DC Leaks and Goosefer, which were dropping a lot of this stuff on me, they haven't done anything since early January. Their job was done. They got their job done. So we're going to, I hope, be able to connect up a lot of the dots, and it's really important because when Comey did testify before being fired this last couple of weeks, he was asked, ""Are the Russians still involved?"" And he goes, ""Yes, they are. Look, why wouldn't they be? It worked for them!"" And it is important that Americans, and particularly people in tech and business understand, Putin wants to bring us down. And he is an old KGB agent. I had, obviously, run-ins with him, because that in large measure prompted his animus toward me, and his desire to help Trump. But it is deeper than that, it is way beyond me.So with respect to the platforms, you know, I am again not exactly sure what conclusions we should draw. But here's what I believe. I believe that what was happening to me was unprecedented and we were scrambling. We went and told everybody we could find in the middle of the summer, the Russians were messing with the election. And we were basically shooed away, like, ""Oh you know, there she goes, vast right-wing conspiracy."" Now it's a vast Russian conspiracy. Well, turned out we were right. And we saw evidence of it. We could track it. And we couldn't get ... we could not get the press to follow it and we never got confirmation. Remember, Comey was more than happy to talk about my emails, but he wouldn't talk about the investigation of the Russians. So people went to vote on November 8th having no idea that there was an active counter-intelligence investigation going on of the Trump campaign.So if I put myself in the position of running a platform like Facebook, first of all, they've got to get back to trying to curate it more effectively. Put me out of the equation, they've got to help prevent fake news from creating a new reality. That does influence how people think of themselves, see the world, the decisions that they make. I don't know enough about what they could have done in real time. It's not like we were not having conversations with them, because a lot of the people on my team were. I also think I was the victim of a very broad assumption I was going to win. ""It doesn't matter what you do to her ...""Swisher: Victim that you were going to win ...Yeah, just you know, everybody.Mossberg: You're talking about Nate Silver and the Times. ""She has an 88 percent ... No she has an 89 percent chance.""Yeah. And you know, I never believed that, I always thought it was going to be a close election because our elections are always close. And you know, if you have an R next to your name or a D next to your name, you end up often falling in line to vote for your candidate.So I think a lot of people ... ""We'll get to that after the election. We're not going to worry about it right now."" And that turned out to be a terrible mistake.Swisher: So a victim that they thought you were going to win ... So what's the difference?Well, I think that was part of it.Swisher: What about a financial element? That they made money from this?Oh I think... Well, look. The networks made more money than they've made in years, and we've got lots of network executives saying things like, ""You know, he may not be good for the country but he's good for business."" And there was that. And putting him on all the time. Calling in wherever he was from. And here's a really telling statistic that has been validated. So, I had this old-fashioned idea that it really mattered what I would do as president [laughter]. And so I laid out very specific plans and I costed them out because I also think it's important to be fiscally responsible.A number of people in this audience were helpful to me, and I thank you. And we had a really good ... we had a great tech program. We had a really good set of policies. Okay. In 2008, which was the last time you had a contested election, not somebody already in the White House, the policies put forth by President Obama, Senator McCain, got 220 minutes of air time, okay? In 2016, despite my best efforts and giving endless speeches and putting out all kinds of stuff, we got 32 minutes. That's all.Mossberg: Total?Total.Mossberg: Over like two years, or how long was ...?Well, over 18 months. Yeah. That was it. Total.Swisher: So does that signify that you need to think about campaign ... Not you in particular. Are you running again, by the way?No.Swisher: Okay. But you need to campaign differently, because you know, you were saying policy doesn't matter, politics did. And Donald Trump ... Look, a lot of people say that he was a great campaigner, a bad president. You were a terrible campaigner, you would have been a great president kind of thing. But you have to win and not ...Look, let's put the campaigning stuff on the table ...Swisher: But don't you have to change? Or not?I won three million more votes than the other guy did [cheers, applause]. And I had a very, very close contest. Basically our votes were neck and neck. He ended up with more delegates and you know, depending on how you counted, I was slightly ahead, slightly behind. So we were absolutely on par when it came to actually getting votes. I won two Senate races in New York. So I never said I was a perfect candidate, and I certainly have never said I ran perfect campaigns, but I don't know who is or did. And at some point it sort of bleeds into misogyny. And let's just be honest, you know, people who have ... [applause] a set of expectations about who should be president and what a president looks like, you know, they're going to be much more skeptical and critical of somebody who doesn't look like and talk like and sound like everybody else who's been president.And you know, President Obama broke that racial barrier, but you know, he's a very attractive, good-looking man with lots of ...Swisher: Well, he's likable enough.He's likable enough, absolutely! [WM laughs] More than, more than. So the campaign ... Look, were there things we could have done differently? You can say that about any campaign.Swisher: But is campaigning going to change in the future?Mossberg: Yeah, but I want to ... I want to follow up on something while we're on this bleeding over into misogyny thing, and it comes from the recent New York Magazine profile of you, which I thought was fascinating and interesting. But the part of it that just leapt off the page for me as a reader was you and some of your staff, folks were quoted in there as saying,""Okay, Bernie Sanders could get angry at the podium about the fate of the people who are trapped in the globalization/automation thing."" Trump certainly did that, oversimplifying, getting angry.You couldn't do that because you're a woman. And if a woman does that, it just backfires on her. And it made me think, are we never going to be able to have a woman in politics who can use that technique, which is an effective technique, which shows I'm emotionally with you just by oversimplifying and getting angry. Is that true? Do you really feel you couldn't do that?Well, let me say this. You know, I have been on many speaking platforms with many men who are in office or running for office. And the crowd gets you going and you get up there and I watch my male counterparts and they beat the podium and they yell and the crowd loves it.And a few times I've tried then and it's been less than successful, let me just say that [laughter]. And it's a little maddening because I'm as angry about what's going on as anybody because I've seen us go backwards as I said in the very beginning about so many things. Economic opportunity, advancements in human rights, civils rights, and the rest.VIDEO3:3503:35Clinton: I take responsibility for every decision I madeClosing BellSwisher: Health care.Health care. I care deeply about this. And I remember when I was doing health care back in the day, '93, '94, and we were trying to move an agenda forward and I went to the American Academy of Pediatrics. And I've always been particularly concerned about what happens to kids who don't get the health care they need.Mossberg: Right.And I gave a really hot speech, and I got hammered for it, repeatedly. Because I don't know what the way forward will be for others, Walt, but for me, trying to convey my commitment, my lifelong commitment, and not only that, what I've done.And you know, I'd put up against anybody who ran, or thought of running, what I've already accomplished compared to what they have on behalf of people. It just is very difficult to go from intensity, passion, emotion, to anger. So, yeah. Try and stay on the other side of that line.Swisher: So spinning it forward, what do you think a Democrat ... how do you assess the current Democratic scene in terms of tech, and also what will happen with this Russian investigation?I'm not going to speculate on who might end up running. We have to first win elections in New Jersey and Virginia in 2017, we've got to take the House back and keep our incumbents and maybe make progress in the Senate. Everything will change if we win in 2018.Mossberg: Do you really believe we can?Yes I do.Mossberg: I say ""we,"" I'm retiring soon.Yeah, we. Yes.Mossberg: We [laughter] can take the House back? [applause]Yes.Mossberg: We've got 20-something Senate seats that we have to defend. I mean seriously, come on. You're really smart about this. Let's be honest.Let's look at the House. We have to flip 24 seats, okay? I won 23 districts that have a Republican Congress member. Seven of them are in California, Darrell Issa being one. If we can flip those, if we can then go deeper into where I did well, where we can get good candidates, I think flipping the House is certainly realistic. It's a goal that we can set for ourselves.Mossberg: Is the party organized to do that?Well, we're working on it. I'm working on it.Mossberg: We don't have a lot of time here.Well you know, but we've got two very good political strategists running the Senate and the House for Democrats, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. They know how to win elections. They're incredibly focused, tireless and effective. So honestly, I'm hopeful about the House. And I'm working on it. I have a new organization called Onward Together and I'm helping some of these new groups that have sprouted up online to recruit candidates, run candidates, help candidates go to town halls, expose Republican members for their hypocrisy and the like. So we're working really hard on this.Mossberg: What about the Senate?I think the Senate is hard to make progress, but I think it's possible to hold our own. All of this depends on what we're talking about. So if the Republicans continue to make progress as they are in going into the next generation of personalization, message delivery, phony stories ... Go to Netflix and say you want to see a political documentary, eight of the top 10 \xe2\x80\x94 last time I checked a few weeks ago \xe2\x80\x94 were screeds against President Obama or me, or both of us.Now, I love Netflix. We're not making the documentaries that we're going to get onto Netflix.Mossberg: This is because Hollywood isn't liberal enough? [laughter]No, it's because Democrats aren't putting their money there. You know, there's a classic line. Democrats give money to candidates, they want a personal connection. So the classic line is Democrats like to fall in love, Republicans just fall in line. Republicans build institutions, Republicans invest in those institutions, Republicans are much more willing to push and cross the line, and Democrats ... I've talked to dozens of donors since my election experience and I've said, ""Look, I'm all for you trying to figure out who you're going to support in 2020, but what about 2017 and what about 2018 and what about helping the DNC try to leapfrog over its horrible data deficit, and how about supporting some of these new groups and see what they can do to generate some activity?""We are not good historically at building institutions. And we've got to get a lot better. And that includes content. We have a great story to tell. You know, I found when I started the campaign that I had to say in practically everyone of my speeches, ""Barack Obama save the economy, and he doesn't get the credit he deserves."" I had to say that because people had been told differently. They didn't feel it yet. You know, income didn't really start inching up until 2015, late 2015.Mossberg: Right.So I was swimming against an historic tide. It's very difficult historically to succeed a two-term president of your own party, because you know, we're itchy people, we like change in American, and I get it. So there was that, but he had done a good job.And you know, it was comparable ... I obviously think back to what my husband inherited, which at that time seemed to be an exploding deficit and an increasing debt. The debt of the country had been quadrupled the prior 12 years. So he had to do a lot of cleanup work, he paid a huge political price for it, lost the Congress in '94, had to fight back for getting reelected, and then we all know what happened in the second term which was bloodsport of the worse kind. And then the Supreme Court, despite Al Gore winning 500,000 more votes rules for Bush. So Bush comes in, and I worked closely with him on 9/11, but honestly the financial crisis, the morass in Iraq, and a lot of the other decisions that were made were very damaging. So then we elect President Obama, he comes in, he inherits the worst economy since the Great Depression, and he has to do a lot of things that are not easy to get it back and moving.And it was like, ""Okay, thank you very much, let's get excited about somebody who's going to really stir us up as opposed to do the job that needs to be done now.""Mossberg: Great analysis on the congressional at the national level [applause]. Let's move down ballot for a second. One of the things that just depresses me all the time is where are the Democrats running ... You know, they're mad at everybody. Every Democrat, every liberal, lots of moderates, even some moderate Republicans, are scared and angry about Trump.Right, right.Mossberg: I don't see him running for school board, I don't see him running for city council, I don't see him running for state legislature ...That's starting to change, Walt. It really is. I've got every finger and toe crossed. So among the groups I'm supporting is a group called Run For Something, started by a young woman who worked for me and my campaign.And they've had thousands of people go on the website to try to figure out what does it mean to run and then to put in information, ""Here's what I'm thinking of."" And they're beginning to win some races. Another group that's been around for a longer time called Emerge America supports women who run. Their grassroots operations invested in women in Nevada, we flipped both houses. I won Nevada, we won the House and the Senate of Nevada. So they're playing catch-up and trying to be more progressive and smart about their policies. You're absolutely right. We used to leave so many races uncontested, and we're not going to do that anymore.Swisher: So when you think about that ... One of the things that we were also talking about last night is Republicans own local television stations, they own radio, they're better at the internet, that got that cable going \xe2\x80\x94 although there's some issues they have over there at Fox News these days. What do you do then? Where do you leapfrog?Because obviously the internet is the best way to leapfrog that. And let's be honest, you have Hollywood on your side. There's a progressive media, most people think of the media as progressive. Well you don't, you think it's not. Like the New York Times for example.Mossberg: The false equivalency.The false equivalency.Swisher: Right, we try to be fair.Mossberg: I sense that that's changing.I hope so.Mossberg: That memo has been received.I hope so. Because what ...Swisher: So where's the in? Technologically?This goes back to the institution building. Because the media forces on the Republican side are entrenched and very effective. So you've got obviously Fox, but you also now have Sinclair buying 140-plus local stations. And they're beginning to call the shots on those local stations.Swisher: Give the example of Montana we talked about.Yeah, well so you know Montana, those of you who saw the now newly elected member of Congress literally beating up, body slamming, pushing around, a young reporter, you know what happened.You know that it had a really terrible look to it. The guy should never have been doing that. I don't know what enraged him so much being asked about health care. Sort of a strange trigger [laughter]. So the NBC affiliate in Montana, can't remember which city, Missoula or Billings. Anyway, they've just been bought by Sinclair. So the NBC mothership in New York calls this station and says, ""Can you send us the footage of what happened?"" They said, ""No, because that reporter was from a liberal paper, and we don't think it's a story we want to be part of."" Now, I find that terrifying. Because local news, yeah, there is the internet and how important it is and everybody who gets their news off of the internet, but local TV is still incredibly powerful.Mossberg: So what are we going to do about it?Well I've been ...Swisher: You and Walt, what are you going to do about it?Well I mean, we have a few ...Mossberg: I've got some time now.You would be a great adviser to one or more of our tech billionaires who want to buy some media.Mossberg: Eh, they don't listen to me.Well then, we're going to have to find other people who will compete against what is a considerable advantage on the other side.Swisher: What do you think about Jeff Bezos owning the Washington Post?I think that Jeff Bezos saves the Washington Post. I think his purchasing the Washington Post ... [applause] Which you know, I think a lot of people, a lot of his peers and friends thought, ""Why would you buy this ancient medium called a newspaper?"" But newspapers, like the Post, the Journal, the Times, a few others, still drive news. Drives news online, drives news on TV.And what Bezos has done, from what I'm told, and Walt and I were talking about this backstage, you know, he's interested in making it a good proposition, but he's hands off on the editorial and content front and he's basically said, ""Get out there and do investigations,"" and they're doing some of the best investigations about what's going on with the White House now. So I think that was really a very good use of his financial resources because now we have a very good newspaper again operating in Washington and driving news elsewhere and doing kind of Whitewater-level investigations.Swisher: So we have to get to questions from the audience, and I don't think we can get intocovfefe right now because it's a longer thing [WM laughs], but ...I thought it was a hidden message to the Russians [laughter].Swisher: Oh you did [laughs]. That is perfect, thank you so much for that. That's going to be on our site in about five seconds [laughter].So there's a lot of calls. One of the things that I'm struck by is a lot of some of the articles are like, ""You've got to stop, you've got to move on, you've got to sunset yourself and go away.""How do you ... I'm offended by it, but what do you think? Because you seem mad as ever,which I love. You know what I mean?You know, look. I'm not going anywhere [applause]. I have a big stake in what happens in this country. I am very, you know, unbowed and unbroken about what happened, because I don't want it to happen to anybody else. I don't want it to happen to the values and the institutions that I care about in America. And I think that we're at a really pivotal point. And therefore I'm going to keep writing and keep talking and keep supporting people who are on the front lines of the resistance.Swisher: Terrific. Question for Hillary Clinton.Mossberg: Why don't we start over here.Guy Horowitz: Guy Horowitz, I'm from Israel. So if it's any comfort, we also had an election decided by an election day weaponized social media case. I don't know if it's comforting at all.Swisher: No it's not, it's worse.Horowitz: That guy also had like a very questionable hairdo. But we survived. So my question to you is ... In Israel we look at everything that's happening outside the U.S. and what Donald Trump is saying and doing from the Paris climate thing and everything else that's happening. It looks like it's a clear and present danger to the world. And we're all talking here, which is good. But I don't feel like we're doing enough, maybe in the U.S., definitely in the world ...Swisher: So question ... I'm sorry ...Horowitz: ... to eliminate this clear and present danger.Mossberg: And the question?Horowitz: And the question is, what can we do right now?Yeah. You know, I'm really glad you asked the question because I do think what he's doing is very dangerous to our position in the world, our leadership, and the stability of the world. I mean, when you give a blank check to the Russians and the Saudis, and others who are in engaged in authoritarian and dictatorial regimes, you are sending a message, ""We don't care what you do."" And that message will be heard. Now, we weren't always able to control what others did, but we sure made it clear we didn't think it was a good idea to engage in invasions and mass murders and other things that we see from the Philippines to the Middle East. When you turn on your allies and you treat them with such disdain and contempt, our democratic NATO allies who have stood with us, who came to our aide after 9/11, you are sending a message that you don't care about history, or even about the current problems that we face. Now, the only comfort I can get out of having lost in the way that I did and having the Russians play such a role is that Necron was ready and able to rebut that. He said, ""I'm the Hillary Clinton of this election.""And they had certain institutional and media predictions that we don't have. But he also was really smart about how he dealt with it. And it also has given a lot of good understanding to Angela Merkel and her team as she moves towards her election, okay? And I think that is important because we need to reform democracies, we need to reform economies, we need to deal with some of the issues that are coming at us like artificial intelligence and robotics and what the heck we're going to do with all these people who are not going to have jobs. There are lots of big questions that the democratic world has to face, including Israel.But we cannot stand idly by and allow Trump to continue to undermine the very strong foundation based on values that we in democracies share. Politicians come and go, but these values and the role that they play in stabilizing the world after the worst war in humanity, is critically important. You mentioned climate change, apparently they're debating in the White House whether to pull out of the Paris agreement. There are only two nations in the world that are not signatories to the Paris Agreement: Nicaragua and Syria. For the United States to throw our lot in with the very, very small number of countries that have turned their backs on climate change, is not only a breach of an agreement ... Usually when you come into office you can try to reform, maybe tinker with agreements, but part of what keeps us going is that America's word is good and you stand with your prior administration, whether it was of your party or not.They're looking to throw all that out the window. But what's really stupid about it is they're throwing out the economic opportunities that being part of the Paris Agreement provide for the United States. That is what I find totally incomprehensible. Now, it is going to be interesting to see where they end up. The president is a very impulsive, reactive personality. So if we all like the Paris Agreement, he may decide to get out of it. Not even understanding one bit about what that means.Or understanding the economic costs of it. You know, somebody is going to really ... probably more than one somebody, will really have the market for clean energy exports. China is moving full speed ahead to be that country. Some of the European countries, particularly when it comes to wind, are already there. Israel I know has some great research being done, particularly on solar. I mean, there's a huge market that somebody's going to own, and we're giving it up. There will be entrepreneurs and businesses, you will do your best to be competitive, but you won't have the full force and support of your government, and I think that is incredibly foolish.Swisher: All right. Short questions so we can get to them.Alexia Bonatsos: Hi Hillary.Hi.Bonatsos: I'm Alexia Bonatsos. First off, thank you so much for what you have done for women [applause]. Thank you. So the present administration is very befuddling. This morning Spicer said that only the president and a small group of people knows what covfefe means. [WM and KS laugh] You've been a party to a lot of classified information.Right.Bonatsos: And you were at Donald Trump's wedding.Yeah [WM laughs].Bonatsos: What do you know about him that we don't, and how do you explain his bizarre behavior and appeal? [laughter, applause]Swisher: That's such a good question!Ah, the small group explanation. You don't have a high enough classification to know what covfefe mean [laughter]. You know, look. I was never even a social friend, it was kind of a lark to go to his third wedding [laughter, applause]. But I have to tell you, I sat behind Shaquille O'Neal, so I didn't see anything [laughter, applause].But, seriously. The behavior that we are now seeing was always present, but it was sort of subordinated to real estate interests, right? He started attacking Ronald Reagan in 1988. You know, ""Our government is a disgrace ..."" So he's been an equal opportunity insulter going back many years. Started thinking about running for president in the '90s. Latched onto the lie of the birther movement about President Obama, rode that as far as he could. But he does have a visceral grasp of America's political underbelly.He really understands how to inflame people, how to motivate them, how to bond with them. Over whatever their grievance is. Whatever resentment or point of anger that you may have, if he can get into it, whether it's race or sex or xenophobia or anti ... Islamophobia, whatever it is. And so we're seeing it on a broader stage. And it is deeply troubling for not only our politics but for our position in the world. And I think the best thing we can do is to continue to stand up, continue to defend the truth. You know, I gave a commencement speech at my alma mater and I quoted my predecessor in the Senate, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, with that famous remark, ""Everybody's entitled to his own opinion but no one is entitled to his own facts."" And that's why we need the media, we need the tech world, we need the online world.We need everybody to be calling them out on their outrageous lies and make it clear that we can have a debate about what is the best way to provide health care, we can have a debate about a budget, but when you present a budget with a trillion dollar mathematical error, it's not like we're going to ignore it. And I think the more voices that can be pushing back, especially in areas that you know things about, the better. And then I'll just get back to politics and elections. We got to have your support here in California and across the country to try to take back the House and too, as Walt rightly says, field more people to run. And if you've ever been interested ... you know, Kara, if you've ever been interested in running, now is the time to get in there.Swisher: I've got it.And because I think people will be hungry for straight talking, common sense, factual information. We don't want to act like the American public isn't capable of making informed decisions. We just have to make sure the information we get is founded in evidence and reality. And then we can have a real debate.Swisher: And you also have to be good with the Twitter. But go ahead.Fred Davis: Hi, I'm Fred Davis, I live near you in New York. It's the day before the election, maybe the morning of the election. From everything I've read, I hear you think you're going to win.Yeah.Davis: Are those accounts accurate? Is the polling industry as inaccurate as we perceive it? And is there any quick suggestions to this crowd on how to fix it?Well, Fred, yeah, I did think I was going to win. I spent the night before the election, I started in Philadelphia. We had a 40,000-person rally with Barack and Michelle and the president had been following it closely.Those of you who know him, he was running his own polling, running his own analytics. And you know, and we thought we were going to win. That's all I can tell you. We knew, I knew, that I'd taken a tremendous hit after the Comey letter. And then later I understood the role that WikiLeaks played in it. But the Comey letter was measurable. You could see my drop. So you know, I needed a big majority to come out of Philadelphia, which I got. Close to 500,000. And I needed about a 15 to 17 point lead to come out of the Philadelphia suburbs. Before the Comey letter, based on our polling, I had about a 22 point lead in the Philadelphia suburbs. After that letter, my momentum, particularly among women in the suburbs, stopped and dropped. So I won the suburbs, but I only won them by 10.And that wasn't enough. I mean, Pennsylvania's always a tough state and you've got to come out of the city and suburbs and Pittsburgh and a few other places. Which I won! I won Pittsburgh, I won the country there, I won Scranton, I won the county there. But I just got killed out in the country and my numbers couldn't hold me up. So yeah, we did think... I think polling is going to have to undergo some revisions in how they actually measure people. How they reach people. The best assessments as of right now are that the polling was not that inaccurate, but it was predominantly national polling, and I won nationally. What was not as obvious was what was happening in states where I was under a lot of pressure from Comey, WIkiLeaks, voter suppression, fake news, all of that. And that's kind of what happened.Swisher: Okay, Rob?Rob: Secretary Clinton, good to see you.Hey, Rob.Rob: As we discussed last night, you were originally on the Senate Watergate committee in the '70s, so you know that part of it firsthand. What has to happen in 2018 to get robust activities in the House, particularly around an investigation? And to tie that back into your comments, how important is a democratic majority in your opinion to have a proper investigation into the Russia stuff and the kleptocracy and the other things that appear to be going on?Well it's critical, Rob. Now one would hope that more Republicans, as they did during the Watergate investigation, because as Rob said, I was on the impeachment enquiry staff of the house judiciary committee, and Republicans then were not happy about investigating a president of their own party, but they were open to the evidence. And we ran under the great leadership of the late John Doar, a meticulous investigation and presentation of facts.We don't have that right now in the Republican majority in the house, although they are continuing with the House investigation. And I'm hoping that that will building some momentum, because the Republicans have to be constantly pushed to put country above party. But I think it will more likely happen if we're successful in taking back the house. That's where investigations could come. Now, in the best of all worlds, if they would set up not a non-partisan, bi-partisan outside committee like we did for 9/11, and put people of unimpeachable integrity, both Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, but people who were willing to go where the facts led them, that would be ideal. I don't see that happening right now.The only point I would make is if the Republican leadership begins to believe that Trump is a big political burden to them, then they will begin to be more open to a more thorough investigation.Mossberg: So what do you think the odds are that McConnell, not Ryan, but McConnell, will come to that conclusion?It all depends upon the numbers.Mossberg: You know this guy.Yeah, I do. And it all depends upon the numbers. I think that the Senate intelligence committee is working very well together from everything that I can see. You've got the Republican chairman, Senator Berg, working with the Democratic vice chairman, Senator Warner. They are pursuing a lot of leads. So I think both ... I mean, the House Committee is trying. I have to commend Adam Schiff, if any of you are in his district he's doing an amazing job [applause]. He's just so thorough and he's so clear.So there are... there's some movement. Now with the special prosecutor being appointed, and I served with him, when I was Secretary of State he was still at the FBI. He's a man of great integrity. That will affect the pace of the investigation, it will affect what happened probably in the Congress, but it will move inexorably forward, because they will not be rebuffed the way that the Congress has been up until now.Nilay Patel: Hi, Nilay Patel, the Verge. I'm from Wisconsin. Why didn't you spend more time in Wisconsin?Well, I will tell you. We thought we were doing really well in Wisconsin. I spent a lot of time in Pennsylvania, a lot of time in Florida. We sent a lot of great surrogates including Tim Kaine and others to Wisconsin.We watched up until the very end how Russ Feingold was winning. And you know, you make these scheduling decisions based on the best information that you have, and it turned out that our information was not as reliable as I wished it had been.Patel: Did you see that before, or is that in hindsight?That's in hindsight, yeah. The other thing that's in hindsight which is really troubling is \xe2\x80\x94 since you're from Wisconsin you may find this particularly interesting \xe2\x80\x94 the AP did a really well-researched piece about voter suppression in Wisconsin. And they literally found people who showed up to vote and were turned away, because Wisconsin under the current governor, Scott Walker, has been one of the leaders in voter suppression, making it difficult. So the 85-year-old woman who doesn't have a photo ID because she doesn't drive anymore shows up with her medicare card and her utility bills and they turn her away.Or the African American. Or the veteran, also African American, who moves from Illinois to Wisconsin, registers to vote, gets on the rolls, but he still has his Illinois driver's license, shows up, they turn him away. The best estimate is that 200,000 people in Wisconsin were either denied or chilled in their efforts to vote.I don't think we believed at the time before the election that it would be anything like that, anything as big as that. So, I will also say that I referenced earlier, there were all these Google searches going on about WikiLeaks, and they were particularly prevalent, very high incidents, in certain counties in Wisconsin. So you had counties that had voted for Obama and were not particularly keen about voting for Trump but worried that I was going to jail, worried that I was running a child trafficking operation in the basement of a pizzeria, the kind of things that were in WikiLeaks [laughter].You laugh, people were obsessing over this stuff. Obsessing over it. And you put yourself in the position of a low-information voter, and all of a sudden your Facebook feed, your Twitter account is saying, ""Oh my gosh, Hillary Clinton is running a child trafficking operation in Washington with John Podesta."" Well, you don't believe it, but this has been such an unbelievable election, you kind of go, ""Oh maybe I better look into that.""Swisher: Yeah, and you are a lizard.Yeah, and well, whatever I am, I'm everything. And so you being to get sucked into it. So some people stayed home, some people voted for Trump, some people stayed with me, and some people went third party, because they wanted to vote, they thought it was their duty, but they didn't like Trump and now they thought I was as bad as they were being told. So it was a confluence of all kinds of things.Samantha Miller: My name is Samantha Miller, I'm known for founding one of the first cannabis labs in the U.S. And what I wanted to say to you is that I'm inspired by you as a leader, not as a woman.Mm, thank you, thank you very much [applause].Miller: And one of the questions I often get asked as an executive, what is some advice you can give to young women who want to attain success? I always say to them, the one thing that I point to for young women is if you can shed the need for external validation, because that's the thing that often keeps you out of the board room, that's a huge step to your success. So I would really appreciate what your advice to women is who are trying to achieve those heights of success.Well I would echo what you said. It is absolutely the case. You have to be better prepared than anybody. You have to know your stuff as well as you possibly can.You have to be brave because there's going to be a lot of setbacks and push-backs and all the things that go with it. And you have to be aware of what, up until now, has been a pretty predictable pattern. You know, Sheryl Sandberg writes about this in ""Lean In"" and the research is convincing. So, as a man gets more successful, regardless of his personality, he gets more likeable. As a woman gets more successful, regardless of her personality, she gets less likeable. It is just inverse. And you have to ... Eleanor Roosevelt said, ""If you're going to be a woman in the public arena, you have to grow skin as thick as the hyde of a rhinoceros."" And you really do have to be prepared. And it's not just in politics, it's in business, it's in, you know, the tech world, it's everywhere. And it's not easy.I mean, it's really, really hard. And I just tell young women to develop more confidence in themselves. You know, I've hired lots of young people over the course of my long career, the private sector and the public sector, not-for-profit sector, and the conversation usually goes like this. You say to a young man, ""I want to give you more responsibility, I want to give you a promotion, I want to pay you more."" And he goes, ""Wow, great! I'm ready! Send me in!"" Sometimes he says, ""What took you so long?"" in getting to that point.But for a young woman, it's like, ""You think I'm good enough? You really do? You think I can do it?"" Well I wouldn't be asking you if I didn't. But there is still, even for upwardly mobile, successful young women, those doubts, that sense of insecurity. And then when you're bombarded with expectations about how you're supposed to look and how you're supposed to act and what you're supposed to say and all the rest of it, it can become very disorienting.So, I guess the final thing I would say is, it really is important both for men and women, for mothers and fathers, for employers of both genders, to be really ready to support young women, and to give them that confidence, that external confidence, but to do everything you can to help them weather all of the push-backs and knockdowns that are going to come their way. [applause]Mossberg: All right, we only have time for one more question, and it goes back over here.Swisher: So make it good.Mossberg: Yeah, make it good.Pete Pachal: All right, no pressure. Pete Pachal from Mashable. Looking at Twitter specifically, you spoke a little bit about Facebook, but on Twitter, if you weigh all its good qualities of bringing realtime information to pretty much everyone, and its bad qualities of basically rewarding sass over substance, and generally not having a lot of nuance, do you think it has been bad or good for our national discourse in the United States?Wow. Haha. Hmm. I think it has certainly provided, as you say, positive information, quick turn-around information, to a very large audience. But I think it has become victimized by deliberate efforts to shape the conversation, and push it towards conspiracies, lies, false information. And I think it's the same problem that Facebook faces, that when you try to be all things to all people and you try to open up your platform so that people can come in, and you want to be influential because you expect people will actually tune you in and read and watch what you have, what do you do to try and contain the weaponization and manipulation of that information? I don't think we know yet.And I have a lot of sympathy at this point. Kara doesn't, but I do [KS laughs] for people trying to make these decisions. I would just urge them to hurry up. Because even if you err slightly more on the curating editorial decision-making, so some voices are going to be cut off, some fake news outlets, the guys in Macedonia are going to be denied entry into your platform, I'd rather see us erring on that side for a while to see what the effects are, instead of being kind of overwhelmed by the challenge, like, ""What do you do?"" I mean, how do you try and determine who should or shouldn't be on your site? And so I think it's a mixed bag.Let me just pose this question: Who is behind driving up Trump's Twitter followers by the millions? We know they're bots. Why? I assume there's a reason for everything. Is it to make him look more popular than he is? Is it to try to influence others on Twitter about what the messaging is so that people get caught up in it and lose sight of what they're trying to say?Mossberg: Well, it puts the Tweets on more feeds. More people's feeds see the Tweets.Yeah, that's my point. You've got millions of people ... the bots are coming in, you've got these repetitive arguments, you're driving up his numbers. But what is it you're trying to achieve? What is the message behind this? So you're sitting in Moscow or Macedonia or the White House, wherever you are [laughter], and you're saying, you know ... [WM laughs]Mossberg: Just three random places.That trip may not have worked out so well, you know, there's no blowback.Mossberg: Really, pushing the guy. ..Pushing the guy, failing to reaffirm our commitment to NATO, all of that. And how do we recover from that? Well, we begin to divert people again. I mean, you can't let Trump and his allies be a diversion. They are a threat. And they have been effective up until now. So Twitter is a perfect example. You're going to drive up the numbers. You've got more people chasing rabbits down rabbit holes, you've got all kinds of stuff happening. Why? To divert attention. It's like covfefe, trending, world wide. Maybe for a minute you'll forget the latest accusations about them conspiring with Russia, or their trillion dollar mathematical mistake in their budget, or depriving 23 million people of health care.You know, it's the circus. Right? It's what a classic authoritarian does. It's not just about influencing your institutions, your values. They want to influence your reality. And that to me is what we're up against. And we can't let that go unanswered, whether it's on Twitter, Facebook, or anywhere else [applause].Swisher: Let's end on that. That's brilliant. Everybody, Hillary Clinton [applause].CNBC's parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Recode's parent Vox, and the companies have a content-sharing arrangement.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/full-transcript-hillary-clinton-at-code-2017.html
352,Enel CEO Francesco Starace would be 'extremely disappointed' if US leaves Paris Agreement,Sustainable Energy,01-06-2017,"Pier Marco Tacca | Getty Images News | Getty Images The CEO of European utility firm Enel would be ""extremely disappointed"" if, as expected, President Donald Trump pulls the U.S. out of the landmark Paris Agreement.Speaking to CNBC at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum 2017, Francesco Starace said he thought ""it would be bad that the U.S. leaves the Paris Agreement, it would be a blow to the Paris Agreement itself from a symbolic standpoint.""Trump is set to announce his decision at 3:00 p.m. ET today. Under the Paris Agreement, reached at the end of 2015, world leaders have committed to making sure global warming stays ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.While many are worried about the impact of the U.S. leaving the accord, Starace sought to strike an optimistic note. ""We have to remember that the energy policy of the U.S. is really driven by the energy policies of the states of the USA, which have different policies: you have very little in common with Wyoming and California, for example.""Most of the states seem to be sticking with their policies, Starace added, and there was no particular worry that, in the medium term, there would be a change in programs or investment policies.California, for its part, has ambitious plans for renewables. It has set itself the target of generating 50 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030, and wants to cut petroleum use in cars and trucks by as much as 50 percent in the next 15 years.Starace went on to address the issue of whether Enel and other businesses in the renewable space would think twice about putting more money into U.S. projects if the U.S. did indeed leave the Paris Agreement.""Look, the way projects are financed in the U.S., no, I don't think there is going to be any problem midterm,"" he said. ""I think for the next three years, the investment flow is basically earmarked and secured.""""Of course, if this attitude gets worse or is complicated by different moves further down, we have to see,"" he went on to add. ""At the moment we don't have any alarm at all.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/enel-ceo-would-be-extremely-disappointed-if-us-leaves-paris-agreement.html
353,"Did Trump, Kushner, Sessions have an undisclosed meeting with Russian?",Politics,01-06-2017,"Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey KislyakGetty ImagesThe FBI and Congress are examining a campaign event last spring during which Donald Trump, Jeff Sessions and Jared Kushner were in a small gathering with Russian ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak and other diplomats at Washington's Mayflower Hotel, multiple U.S. officials told NBC News.Five current and former U.S. officials said they are aware of classified intelligence suggesting there was some sort of private encounter between Trump and his aides and the Russian envoy, despite a heated denial from Sessions, who has already come under fire for failing to disclose two separate contacts with Kislyak. Kushner also denied through a spokesman that he met privately with Kislyak that day.The officials acknowledged to NBC News that the evidence does not amount to proof, and they have declined to provide details about it.More from NBC News:Is new PAC Joe Biden's last act in politics or first step toward 2020?Women's equality party: Sophie Walker aims to oust Philip Davies Ohio sues Big Pharma, blaming drug makers for causing opioid epidemic""The Department of Justice appointed special counsel to assume responsibility for this matter,"" Department of Justice spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said in a statement. ""We will allow him to do his job. It is unfortunate that anonymous sources whose credibility will never face public scrutiny are continuously trying to hinder that process by peddling false stories to the mainstream media. The facts haven't changed; the then-Senator did not have any private or side conversations with any Russian officials at the Mayflower Hotel.""CNN reported Wednesday about the investigative interest in the Mayflower event, which took place on April 27, 2016. NBC News has been discussing the matter with knowledgeable sources for weeks, seeking more clarity about why Congressional investigators believe there may have been a private meeting.A U.S. official with knowledge of the matter told NBC News that the FBI also is scrutinizing the Mayflower event, which was sponsored by a pro-Russian think tank. The official said the FBI is interested in who was at the event and what was said, in the context of the counter-intelligence investigation into Russian election meddling. That official said there was no indication the bureau is zeroing in on Sessions.Sen. Al Franken, D.-Minnesota, who originally questioned Sessions about his Russian contacts during a confirmation hearing for Sessions' appointment as attorney general, discussed the matter Wednesday night on MSNBC's The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell""It had been characterized one way, but we had some reason to believe that wasn't the case,"" Franken said about the event. ""It had been described in a way that he could say, 'I don't remember that.'""It has long been known that Trump briefly met Ambassador Kislyak that day at a VIP reception shortly before he gave a foreign policy address at the hotel. But witnesses said it wasn't a private meeting, and White House officials dismissed it as inconsequential.""Mr. Trump warmly greeted Mr. Kislyak and three other foreign ambassadors who came to the reception,"" the Wall Street Journal reported in May 2016.Kushner and Sessions were also in the room, contemporaneous news reports say. Sessions' aides have insisted he did not speak to Kislyak.Congress is investigating the credibility of intelligence seeming to contradict that account, current and former U.S. officials say. And Franken, in a March letter to the FBI with Judiciary Committee Democrat Patrick Leahy, asked the bureau to investigate any contacts between Sessions and Russian officials, and to brief him on the results. He has not yet received an answer, an aide said.The FBI investigation into Russian election interference is now supervised by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and Sessions is walled off from it, having recused himself.In March, the Center for National Interest, the right-leaning, Russia-linked group that hosted the event, said that the receiving line ""moved quickly and any conversations with Mr. Trump in that setting were inherently brief and could not be private. Our recollection is that the interaction between Mr. Trump and Ambassador Kislyak was limited to the polite exchange of pleasantries appropriate on such occasions.""Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation after it emerged that he had met twice with Kislyak after telling senators under oath during his confirmation hearing that he had not met with Russian officials about the Trump campaign.""In retrospect,"" Sessions told reporters, ""I should have slowed down and said, 'But I did meet one Russian official a couple of times, and that would be the ambassador.'""Lawmakers involved in the Russia investigation would not discuss the April meeting.""I can't comment on any of that,"" Sen. Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence committee, told NBC News.""Can't talk about it,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, a member of the committee.In a little noticed portion of a March congressional hearing on the Russia investigation, Rep. Mike Quigley, a Chicago Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, accused Sessions of having committed perjury about an alleged undisclosed third meeting in April.He noted that Sessions had failed to disclose meetings with Kislyak in July and September, during a time the Russians were ""hacking and dumping"" stolen emails in the election campaign.He added, ""Unfortunately, what we're reading now is that there was a third meeting as early as April of last year in Washington, D.C., a meeting at which Candidate Trump was present and the Russian ambassador was present. At some point in time, this goes well beyond an innocent, under the best of circumstances, 'Oh I forgot' sort of thing, or `That doesn't count.' When you correct your testimony in front of the United States Senate, you're still under oath and you're swearing to the American people that what you're saying is true. Well, the third time is well beyond that and is quite simply, perjury.""Quigley said he could not discuss the basis of his remarks about the April event, other than to say he wasn't relying solely on news reports.Any confirmation of a private meeting with Kislyak in April would raise a host of questions, most particularly for Sessions.April 2016 is when officials at the Democratic National Committee first noticed suspicious activity on their network \xe2\x80\x94 activity they would later learn was part of a Russian hack.At Sessions' confirmation hearing in January, Sen. Franken asked him, ""If there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?""Sessions replied: ""Senator Franken, I'm not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians, and I'm unable to comment on it.""In March, the Washington Post reported that Sessions had met twice with Kislyak \xe2\x80\x94 once in the senator's office in September, and once in July at a Heritage Foundation event.On March 2, at a news conference announcing his recusal from the Russia investigation, Sessions said: ""I never had meetings with Russian operatives or Russian intermediaries about the Trump campaign. And the idea that I was part of a quote, 'continuing exchange of information' during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government is totally false.""He acknowledged, however, that the two meetings reported by the Post had occurred. He said he didn't recall much of what was discussed. He said he took the meetings as a senator, not a Trump adviser.A reporter asked if he recalled meeting with Kislyak any other times.""I don't recall having met him,"" Sessions answered. ""It's possible \xe2\x80\x94 I'm on the Armed Services Committee and things happen, but I don't recall having met him before those two meetings.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/did-trump-kushner-sessions-have-an-undisclosed-meeting-with-russian.html

Williams said on Thursday he sees a total of three interest rate increases for this year as his baseline scenario, but views four hikes as also being appropriate if the U.S. economy gets an unexpected boost.""There is potential for upside occurrences in the economy. One big question mark is if there is big fiscal stimulus or other changes in the outlook that we see the economy is doing better than we thought,"" said Williams, who was speaking on the sidelines of a forum held by the Bank of Korea in Seoul.Williams, who does not have a vote on the Federal Reserve's policy committee this year, said the end-point of rate hike-cycle is probably just below 3 percent. He emphasized that the Fed will carry out its rate increases in a predictable and transparent manner to minimize any negative spillovers to emerging economies.In the end we are only moving gradually and to a relatively low level, 3 percent or less, he said.In March the Fed lifted rates a notch, its third tightening since the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession. Forecasts from Fed officials suggest a median of two more hikes are planned before year end, and futures markets are pricing in a roughly 90 percent chance of a 25-basis-point hike later this month to a range of between 1.00 percent and 1.25 percent.Williams said he doesn't expect any changes in fiscal policies this year to impact the U.S. economy in 2017 in any meaningful way, adding the effects of such policy changes will likely influence growth only in 2018 and 2019.He also reiterated his view that the U.S. economy is doing ""very well,"" though he said that inflation currently running below the Feds 2 percent target is a challenge for monetary policy.Prices excluding food and energy in the Feds preferred inflation gauge were up only 1.5 percent on-year in April, the weakest reading since the end of 2015.Just the same, Fed officials have said they remain confident that low unemployment will help lift inflation toward the central bank's target in coming years.

355,The $7 trillion promise of self-driving vehicles,Autos,01-06-2017,"VIDEO0:5900:59The future of driverless carsPower LunchWhy are so many automakers, tech firms, components suppliers and ride-hailing companies pouring billions of dollars into developing self-driving cars and trucks?In part, it's because the payoff could eventually be worth $7 trillion.That's the estimate of a new study from the research firm Strategy Analytics and Intel, one of several tech giants investing heavily in autonomous-drive systems.""This technology is driving big changes,"" said Kathy Winter, vice president and general manager of Intel's Automated Driving Group. ""Time will be freed up by people not driving, there will be increased productivity and new goods and services to be consumed.""The study predicts a global ""passenger economy"" will start to grow after the first fully autonomous-drive vehicles hit the market in the next four to five years. At first, there will not be many, and their use will be limited, but by 2035 Intel expects the passenger economy will climb to $800 billion worldwide.In 2050, Intel estimates, the global passenger economy will be worth $7 trillion. While it's too soon to know which companies will profit the most from the new world of transportation, Intel estimates the money will come in three primary areas.$3.7 trillion from consumer mobility-as-a-serviceIncludes: Vehicle car-share and ride-share companies.$2.9 trillion from business/business-to-business mobility-as-a-service.Includes: Freight and self-driving delivery companies.$203 billion from pilotless vehicle servicesIncludes: Consumer businesses like restaurants, health-care providers, entertainment companies.Initially, many of the autonomous vehicle services and benefits will be found in cities and suburban areas with large populations. However, analysts believe self-driving vehicles will also reach rural areas.""There are probably people in a rural area who have as much of a need for autonomous-drive vehicles as someone in a city,"" said Roger Lanctot, director of automotive connected mobility in the global automotive practice at Strategy Analytics.While the dollar impact of the coming passenger economy is huge, the other benefits of widespread adoption are enormous. For example, Intel estimates pilotless vehicles will save at least 585,000 lives between 2035 and 2050.WATCH:\xc2\xa0 Autonomous cars years and years away: ExpertVIDEO3:1703:17Autonomous cars years and years away: ExpertPower Lunch",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/the-7-trillion-promise-of-self-driving-vehicles.html

LeBron's LA Home Vandalized With Racists TermMets Team Mascot Gets Caught Giving Finger to FansThe video shows officers approach Wood's Mercedes-Benz pulled over on the side of the road with its right turn signal on. An officer tells Woods he was stopped ""in the middle of the road.""The car's engine was running, the responding officer said. The officer said Woods was roused from his sleep. The officer said he ""had extremely slow and slurred speech.""Woods submitted to a sobriety test and took two breathalyzer tests, which registered a 0.00 reading, indicating he was not under the influence of alcohol. But police noted four medications used after knee and Achilles tendon injuries.He was arrested on a charge of driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and cited for improper stopping, standing or parking in an illegal place, court records show.Woods, who had a fourth back surgery in April, offered an apology later Monday but denied alcohol was involved.""What happened was an unexpected reaction to prescribed medications,"" he said in a statement. ""I didn't realize the mix of medications had affected me so strongly.""In one of dashcam videos, Woods says he is headed to Jupiter, Florida.

When asked, Woods did say he had taken medication that evening. Woods appears to become confused when asked to repeat the alphabet, and begins walking away, asking ""what are we doing?"" He is later taken into custody without incident.The videos were released under a public records request.The 14-time tournament winner has remained one of the wealthiest athletes in the world, according to Forbes. But a slew of injuries over the years have brought his career to a near standstill, and he remained off the fairway for 16 months until last December, when he competed in a tournament event.In 2009, Woods was involved in another car accident in which he crashed his Cadillac Escalade into a fire hydrant and neighbor's tree, and was charged with careless driving. In the aftermath, rumors surfaced that Woods had been having extramarital affairs with other women.He eventually admitted to his sexual indiscretions in a television statement in which he famously admitted, ""I was unfaithful. I had affairs. I cheated.""Soon after, he and wife Elin Nordegren, a Swedish model, announced their divorce after almost seven years together.Woods, beset by injuries, was unable to jump-start his career until 2013, when he racked up tournament victories again. But nagging back pain and spasms forced him to withdraw from competitions, including the Masters, which he first won in 1997 at just 21 years old.This year has been spent playing in a limited capacity. Woods  wrote on his website in April that he underwent another ""successful"" back surgery to alleviate pain in his back and leg.""When healed, I look forward to getting back to a normal life, playing with my kids, competing in professional golf and living without the pain I have been battling so long,"" he said. Sports analysts speculate Woods shouldn't be expected to return to the links any time this year.

358,Russia is looking to regulate bitcoin but still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see it as a currency,Tech Transformers,01-06-2017,"Bitcoin signReutersRussia is exploring ways to regulate , the country's central bank governor has told CNBC, but sees ""doubts"" over the benefits of the cryptocurrency and even questions whether it should be considered a virtual currency at all.  In an interview with CNBC, Elvira Nabiullina, governor of the Russian Central Bank, explained that she views bitcoin as a digital asset rather than a currency, and this is the way it should be thought about with regards to regulation.  When asked whether the Russian Central Bank is looking to regulate bitcoin, Nabiullina said that the authority is ""analyzing"" the possibility and needs to ""understand more about this internalization of bitcoin and our regulatory systems."" She added that there are ""risks"" with the cryptocurrency.  ""We don't consider that bitcoin can be considered as a virtual currency. It's more digital assets with the regulation of assets,"" Nabiullina told CNBC in a TV interview.VIDEO4:1904:19Gartman's bitcoin beefFast MoneyThe central banker did not elaborate on what specific regulation would look like and said she is in no rush to put any policy into place. The governor said that the central bank does have doubts about bitcoin.  ""We have some doubts, we don't see some huge benefits from introducing digital assets in our economy,"" Nabiullina said. Bitcoin recently hit a record high of $2,791, according to data from industry website CoinDesk, marking around a 180 percent rally year-to-date. There's bullishness in the market with some predicting the price could go as high as $6,000 this year and even $100,000 in a decade.  With surging prices and a market capitalization of around $38 billion, governments are becoming increasingly interested in ways to regulate the digital currency, especially as more retail investors are getting involved in the market. Japan recently passed a law to legalize payments in bitcoin which helped boost the price, with major trading volumes now coming from the country.  The stance of Nabiullina marks a changed view from Russian authorities who have been trying over the years to ban bitcoin. If Russia somehow regulates bitcoin, this could potentially affect the price, especially if more investors get involved in the asset.  Sean Walsh, a partner at Redwood City Ventures which invests in bitcoin and blockchain companies, said that further regulation could boost the price of the cryptocurrency and get rid of the handful of ""bad actors"" using it for illegal things.  ""I agree with the view that for retail and professional investors greater regulatory structure is very supportive because it adds to the legitimacy of the whole network,"" Walsh told CNBC in a phone interview.  Taxation plan?Still, it's unclear where Russia plans to go with bitcoin regulation. The country's Deputy Finance Minister Alexey Moiseev recently said the authorities hope to recognize bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a legal financial instrument in 2018 in a bid to tackle money laundering.""The state needs to know who at every moment of time stands on both sides of the financial chain,"" Moiseev told Bloomberg in an interview.""If there's a transaction, the people who facilitate it should understand from whom they bought and to whom they were selling, just like with bank operations.""  The Russian Central Bank's Deputy Chairwoman Olga Skorobogatova has also reportedly revealed plans to tax the cryptocurrency.VIDEO2:0802:08Markets are prepared for normalizing monetary policy: Russia's central bank governorSquawk Box Europe""(Digital currencies already circulating in Russia will see) certain regulations with regard to taxes, monitoring and reporting, as a digital commodity,"" Skorobogatova said, according to news agency Interfax.Blockchain in focus  Bitcoin has traditionally been known to allow users to make payments and money transfers anonymously. So it may seem that any taxation policy from the authorities could be difficult. But Walsh said some developments in the bitcoin community could make this policy feasible.  Firstly, bitcoin transactions have become slower and more expensive. This makes the practice of trying to split up transactions to cover your tracks very difficult. Secondly, several start-ups have emerged that are able to use algorithms to track transactions on the blockchain - the public ledger of bitcoin activity. This could allow authorities to see who owns bitcoin.  While Nabiullina admitted there were still risks with bitcoin, she expressed the Russian Central Bank's interest in blockchain technology. Because of the way blockchain technology can create a tamper-proof ledger of activity, many major banks are looking into how it can be used for tasks such as trading.  ""I think it's more important to understand (the) benefits of new technologies \xe2\x80\xa6 like blockchain which is on the basis of bitcoin,"" Nabiullina told CNBC.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/bitcoin-russia-regulation.html

""We're able to look at a massive amount of data and based on things like their current salary, how long has it been since they were recently promoted, how competitive is that job outside the company, we can make a prediction whether that person is likely to leave in the next 12 months.

""And I'm not sure that's going to be repeatable forever, or at least in the foreseeable future, [but] I think it just demonstrates the scalability and positive nature of our business model.""And as major clients like 21st Century Fox sign on to receive more of Workday's services, its standing in the cloud space is only becoming more prominent.""We're beginning to get those proof points, along with the Netflixes of the world and the Aons of the world, that large companies are beginning to move their financial systems to the cloud. So it's a very exciting time for us,"" the CEO said.In response to Bhusri's statements on Workday's competition, SAP told CNBC in an email that it stood by its strategy.""Name calling is certainly one way to attract attention,"" SAP said.

Are you ready?Forecasts out in late May from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predict a 70 percent likelihood of 11 to 17 named storms during the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, including five to nine hurricanes. In the central Pacific, NOAA's latest projections call for five to eight tropical cyclones (including tropical depressions, tropical storms and hurricanes).For perspective, an average Atlantic hurricane season produces 12 named storms, six of which become hurricanes. Last year, the most active season since 2012, had 15 named storms, including seven hurricanes.Although the season peaks in August, there are several precautions worth putting in place well before a storm threatens:1) Review your homeowners insuranceIt's important to understand how well you're covered, should a hurricane damage your home. Gaps could leave you on the hook for tens of thousands of dollars.For example, your regular policy deductible may not apply. Many policies have separate windstorm or hurricane deductibles, set as a percentage of your home's insured value.You'll also need a separate flood insurance policy to cover any storm damage related to flooding. Even if you have a policy, the National Flood Insurance Program's $250,000 cap may mean you'd benefit from excess flood coverage.Handout | Getty ImagesThe time to act is now. That helps you plan financially for any unexpected policy-gap costs \xe2\x80\x94 and gives you time to get new flood insurance coverage in place.""It takes about 30 days to obtain a policy,"" Doug Lyons, a financial advisor at Douglas J. Lyons Financial Group in Red Bank, New Jersey, told CNBC.Read more: Make sure your home is ready for hurricane season2) Prep a 'go bag'Gathering important financial documents is a key part of a disaster preparedness plan. That way, you can grab them quickly in an evacuation.Experts recommend pulling together documents that might be hard to replace (such as birth certificates and Social Security cards) and those that might be helpful after a storm (such as your homeowners insurance policy and contact details for your agent). Having some cash on hand is smart, too.Read more: Here's what should be in your ""go bag""3) Weigh the need for travel insuranceEven if you don't live in a hurricane-prone area, you may want to consider insurance if you have travel plans that will take you to or through an at-risk destination. Ahead of Hurricane Matthew last year, U.S. airlines canceled thousands of flights, while Miami International Airport and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport temporarily shut down.VIDEO1:1901:19Save money when booking a vacationYour Money, Your FutureWhether you'd benefit from insurance depends on several factors, including the cost of your trip and where you're headed.""There's no simple answer, because everyone's trip is slightly different,"" Christopher Elliott, who advocates on behalf of travelers through Elliott.org, told CNBC.Policies can vary widely, so dig into the details before you buy. Hurricanes are typically covered, but one policy might allow you to cancel your trip as soon as there's an official storm warning in effect for your destination, while another may require a bigger impact like a delayed flight.This is another area where procrastination doesn't pay: To get coverage, you must buy the policy before NOAA names the storm threatening your trip.Read more: 4 questions to ask before you buy travel insurance",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/were-in-for-an-above-normal-hurricane-season-heres-how-to-get-ready.html

Express Scripts claims it is owed more than $14.5 million in fees and rebates related to Evzio, and it has dropped the drug from its preferred list.Jennifer Stepp and her daughter Audrey Stepp, 8, hand out trainer boxes of Evzio, a Naloxone auto-injector that helps with opioid overdoses after a Naloxone training class for children and adults to learn how to inject Naloxone into people that overdose on opioids in Louisville, Kentucky.John Sommers II | ReutersIn recent months, anger over rising drug costs  set off a civil war within the pharmaceutical industry, pitting drug makers against other players in the health care system, including the little-known pharmacy benefit managers who negotiate with drug makers on behalf of insurers, large employers and government health programs. Drug makers and some  members of Congress have accused Express Scripts and other benefit managers of operating in the shadows, pocketing an undisclosed share of the payments they exact from drug makers even as consumers are asked to pay inflated prices for the medicines they need.The lawsuit was heavily redacted because Express Scripts said it contained ""sensitive business information,"" but nevertheless it provides some tantalizing details about the company's dealings. Consultants and brokers \xe2\x80\x94 who advise employers on their prescription drug plans \xe2\x80\x94 said it showed that Express Scripts is collecting fees that keep rising as drug prices go up.For example, according to the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in St. Louis, Express Scripts charged Kal\xc3\xa9o ""administrative fees"" that climbed sharply at the same time that Evzio was rising in price. In January 2016, when Evzio carried a list price of $937.50 for two injectors, Express Scripts billed Kal\xc3\xa9o monthly administrative fees of about $25,000 for its commercial clients. But three months later, Evzio's price had climbed to $4,687.50, and these fees totaled nearly $130,000. That's on top of charges that included ""formulary rebates,"" or drug discounts, and ""price protection rebates,"" which are triggered when a drug jumps in price. Those price-protection rebates totaled $14 million \xe2\x80\x94 most of the money that Express Scripts is trying to recoup.Benefit managers like Express Scripts typically pass the rebates they collect from manufacturers along to their clients \xe2\x80\x94 insurers and large employers \xe2\x80\x94 after taking a portion of the rebates for themselves. But critics, like Linda Cahn, the chief executive of Pharmacy Benefit Consultants in Morristown, New Jersey, say that the benefit managers are not transparent about what share of fees they keep, and what share they pass along to clients.Administrative fees are particularly murky, she and others said. Some of the fees are passed to clients, but benefit managers also collect other fees that are not returned to clients.""The lawsuit reveals that Express Scripts is collecting immense sums of money. No one knows what they're passing through and what they're retaining,"" said Cahn, who flagged the lawsuit in a note to clients Monday. ""Every client and the federal government and taxpayers should insist that they do.""But Brian Henry, a spokesman for Express Scripts, disagreed with her assessment and described Kal\xc3\xa9o as a ""deadbeat dad."" ""They owe rebates and administrative fees that we share with our clients and we are working to get that money back,"" he said in a statement.Henry also said, ""The vast majority of the administrative fees are passed back to our clients."" In cases in which they are not, he said, it is with the consent of the client. While Henry initially said that all administrative fees are passed along to Medicare plans, he later said he misspoke and that he should have said the ""vast majority"" of such fees were passed along to Medicare plans.Spencer Williamson, the chief executive of Kal\xc3\xa9o, said in a statement that the lawsuit was ""baseless"" and that the company was committed to providing affordable access to its drug ""without burdensome paperwork or high out-of-pocket costs.""The lawsuit is the latest piece of bad news for Kal\xc3\xa9o, a private Virginia company with just two products on the market. When Evzio arrived on the market in 2014,  it was sold as an easy-to-use device, similar to an EpiPen, that could be stowed in a pocket or medicine cabinet and quickly used by friends or relatives to reverse the effects of a drug overdose.But while the device was initially hailed by addiction experts who said it would make it easier to stop fatal overdoses, the company came under heavy criticism in 2016, when it quintupled the price of Evzio. The price increase \xe2\x80\x94 which came in the midst of a national opioid abuse epidemic \xe2\x80\x94 prompted letters from  members of Congress, demanding to know what had prompted the change.Kal\xc3\xa9o has said it sharply raised the price of Evzio to cover the cost of a new patient-assistance program that lowers the out-of-pocket costs for people who cannot afford the product. Kal\xc3\xa9o covers all of the out-of-pocket costs for patients with private insurance, and offers Evzio free of charge to uninsured people who make less than $100,000 a year.Source: EvzioBut critics have said that  such patient-assistance programs serve to drive up the cost of drugs to the health care system because while they ease the burden on patients, they leave insurers with the bulk of the bill, especially when a less expensive alternative is available. Other forms of naloxone, the active ingredient in Evzio, are available at a much lower price.This is not the first time Express Scripts has sued a drug maker with expensive products. In 2015, Express Scripts filed suit against Horizon Pharma, also over unpaid fees. Horizon  agreed to pay Express Scripts $65 million in September 2016 to settle the case. After initially dropping coverage of Horizon's drugs, Express Scripts added them back to its preferred drug list.Express Scripts is also being sued. Last year, the insurance giant Anthem sued Express Scripts in federal court in New York for $15 billion and claimed the company had been overcharging it for drugs.  Express Scripts, which denied the claims, said recently that it would most likely lose Anthem, its largest customer, beginning in 2020, leading to speculation about how the company will replace the business it is losing.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/a-drug-quintupled-in-price-now-drug-industry-players-are-feuding-over-the-windfall.html

Economists had expected the closely watched index to slip to 54.5, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate. ISM's index last stood at 54.8 in April. This implies the overall manufacturing economy grew for the 96th consecutive month. ""Comments from the panel generally reflect stable to growing business conditions, with new orders, employment and inventories of raw materials all growing in May compared to April,"" Timothy Fiore, chair of ISM's business survey committee, said in a statement. ""The slowing of pricing pressure, especially in basic commodities, should have a positive impact on margins and buying policies as this moderation moves up the value chain."" Of the 18 manufacturing industries surveyed for this report, 15 reported growth in May \xe2\x80\x94 including furniture; plastics and rubber products; machinery; and food, beverage and tobacco products.

367,Yolt mobile money management app yomps into view presaging open banking and data environment,FinTech,01-06-2017,"The Yolt mobile money management app has been built for the coming open banking and data environment envisaged by European regulations such as the EU PSD2 and U.K. Open Banking initiative, which both try to ensure fintechs can access payment and banking data. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are the preferred technology for open banking and, some say, the future of financial services.Kiyoshi Ota | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Yolt mobile money management app has launched in the U.K. today in an open beta testing format that invites consumers to download the ING Bank supported app for free on Google's Android or Apple's iOS operating system.Users can view their bank accounts, credit cards, bills and so forth from various different providers in one place.Yolt enables price comparison, budget setting, account checking and other such functionality to be carried out from a user's mobile phone as it seeks to collate consumer finance data in an easily accessible format.Chief Executive Frank Jan Risseeuw said in a statement: ""We're a mobile app, designed to change the way people think about their finances, and harness the power of open banking to make it easier for people to focus on other things in life.""Yolt launched with an energy price comparison tool today. The company says it is working with other financial technology (fintech) startups to integrate more comparison features in the future as its rollout continues.It was previously in a closed beta test phrase with 2,500 restricted users and limited functionality since November of last year. The Dutch headquartered ING Bank, which owns the app, wanted to develop the app prior to this wider launch in the U.K. Other markets in Poland, the Netherlands and elsewhere where ING operates may follow. ""We will soon launch a comparison service for international money transfer comparison in the U.K.,"" said Frank Jan Risseeuw, COE of Yolt, in a conversation with CNBC.com. This will join the energy price comparison tool unveiled today and could be joined by insurance, bank account provider data and numerous other such tools in the future.Risseeuw said the company plans to ""keep expanding the partner ecosystem"" in future ""based on the user feedback we get and the interesting partners we meet on our development journey"".According to Risseeuw, Yolt is based on three principles. It allows users to:Create an overview of every account a consumer hasExplore insights based on consumers' spending data and predicted future expendituresMake it possible to act on the data to get a better bank account provider, insurer, credit card, energy provider and so forth.Open banking and data environment Yolt is important because it presages a more 'open banking' environment and will take advantage of the European Union's (EU) imminent new Payment Services Directive (PSD) 2 regulation. This seeks to encourage more competition among the continent's banking and payment providers by freeing up data and market access, giving opportunities to fintech newcomers outside of traditional transaction banks to disrupt the marketplace.The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is also attempting to make bank account and transaction data more open. The aim of the U.K. CMA Open Banking initiative is to make the industry more competitive and like a utility. Combined with the EU PSD2 regulation, it could lead to an avalanche of new fintech-enabled financial services providers in 2018 when both rules are due to go fully live.The CMA Open Banking initiative mandates that U.K. banks must make standardized product and reference data available to authorized third parties by 2018 in order to increase competition and service. With customer consent, U.K. banks will also have to provide secure access to specific current accounts by 2018, enabling others to read the transaction data and initiate payments.This will mean that banks cannot hold on to customer data exclusively, as they have in the past. The information will be shared through an open Application Programming Interface (API) framework, which the U.K. regulator says will prioritize customer protection and maintain cybersecurity. An Open Banking Implementation Entity will develop API standards to allow two different pieces of software from different financial institutions (FIs) to interact and exchange data in a secure environment.Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) The API-led revolution in the U.K. will mean that Yolt, or any other such apps, can in the future develop tools to mine data more easily, offer price comparison tools and develop competitive banking or personal finance products. The idea is that customers will own their data in the future, not the banks, and can give permission for it to be shared. When data is free and accessible, and tools can be built around it via open APIs, customers should be able to be informed by technology-led newcomers about where to find the best prices, services and so on.The interaction between regulation and technology is crucial here. Regulators are trying to free up the marketplace to admit the power of new data sharing and analytical technologies in a secure manner.   However, it is not just fintechs that can take advantage of the new rules. As the ING-backed launch of Yolt proves banks may use it too to break into new markets themselves. The CMA mandated API revolution is not due to hit until 2018. The final EU-wide national implementation of the PSD2 regulation is also not due until 2018 and there are still some outstanding issues to resolve, principally the draft PSD2 regulatory technical standards (RTS) rule proposed by the European Banking Authority (EBA). If it goes through this amendment would ban screen scraping of customer data from online banking interfaces and mean the banks could retain more control of how and when data is shared. A coalition of 62 fintech firms organized by the European Fintech Alliance (EFA) is presently fighting the RTS amendment to ban screen scraping.The future regulatory controls and landscape for open data and banking in Europe is therefore yet to be finalized, but the direction of travel is clear.As Risseeuw said in conversation with CNBC.com: ""Yolt has been developed to fully harness Open Banking and PSD2 in order to build a platform where people can manage their money in one place. APIs are the preferred technology for open banking (as demanded by PSD2). We've invested in our solution to be ready to deal with this, and for when the APIs of the banks will become available.""Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

369,China renews call for Seoul to halt THAAD amid 'shocking' news of new launchers,Defense,01-06-2017,"VIDEO0:5200:52Some South Korea residents aren't happy with a new missile defense systemNews VideosChina's state-owned media on Thursday criticized reports new THAAD anti-missile launchers were secretly brought into South Korea without approval from the Seoul government.Citing a statement from Beijing's foreign ministry spokesperson, China Daily said the communist nation is ""gravely concerned"" over reports about the new THAAD launchers. It also said the official indicated ""deployment will severely damage China's security interests and undermine the regional strategic balance.""Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system after arriving in South Korea on March 6. The U.S. military deployed the system in response to North Korean missile threats.Source: U.S. Defense DepartmentSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in was quoted this week as saying it was ""very shocking"" to learn that his own country's Defense Ministry failed to report to him that an additional four launchers for the THAAD missile shield system have been brought into the country. The new launchers are in addition to two that had already been installed.Moon, who took office May 10, ordered a probe into why he wasn't informed about the additional THAAD rocket launchers.As a presidential candidate, Moon sought to delay deployment of THAAD and asked for more discussion on the matter. He also suggested while running that the U.S. could do more harm in the end by rushing the deployment. The fuss over the U.S. bringing in more THAAD anti-missile launchers now has some American analysts questioning whether Moon might be playing into the hands of China. Moreover, they say there's a risk the new South Korean president could ultimately change course on THAAD for economic reasons.That said, Moon insisted Wednesday that he isn't seeking to reverse the current deployment arrangement between Washington and Seoul, which was reached last July. Regardless, defense analysts said much is at stake because of the continuing threat from North Korea's missile and nuclear programs. ""You've got folks who are in place, elected by the people, who are not representing them well,"" said John Venable, a U.S. Air Force veteran and senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based conservative think-tank.The defense expert added: ""There is no harm in having the THAAD system in place. It's a political talking point that a politician wants to use to distance himself from America.""Also playing out in the THAAD drama is Moon's apparent attempt to win favor with Beijing, which has applied economic pressure on Seoul to remove THAAD, which stands for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense.For South Korea, the economic clout of China has proven to be a mixed blessing. China represents about one-quarter of the trade with South Korea and the addition of Hong Kong makes that figure exceed 30 percent.However, Beijing and its state media have waged a campaign to essentially boycott South Korean businesses and to reduce tourism travel to the U.S. ally. ""The Chinese have essentially put a de facto blockage on South Korea for deploying THAAD,"" said Harry Kazianis, director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest, a think-tank founded by former President Richard Nixon.""When they lose money from a big economy like China \xe2\x80\x94 tourism, manufactured goods, other types of trade \xe2\x80\x94 that hurts them. So that's why this is a much bigger deal than it should be,"" Kazianis added.Analysts say China opposes THAAD because it believes the advanced anti-missile radar system's powerful radar gives the U.S. and South Korea capability not only to spot ballistic missiles from North Korea, but to potentially look deep into China to monitor military activities.  The THAAD system, which is made by U.S. defense contractor Lockheed Martin, went operational in early May at a location about 130 miles south of Seoul. The first launchers for the system arrived in South Korea in March.There were suggestions at one point that the new launchers were brought into South Korea by the U.S. military without knowledge of the Seoul government. The U.S. Department of Defense, though, rejects the assertion it left Seoul out of the loop on THAAD.The Pentagon's spokesman, Army Major Jamie Davis, said in a statement Wednesday that the Pentagon had ""worked closely and (had) been fully transparent"" with South Korea, or the Republic of Korea (ROK), throughout the entire THAAD process. ""The rising North Korean missile threat makes THAAD a defensive necessity and the ROK-U.S. alliance moved as quickly as possible, together, to bring this important capability to the ROK,"" he added.""To be quibbling over interceptors is really a small tragedy,"" said Kazianis. According to Kazianis, ""North Korea has over 1,000 missiles that literally could strike South Korea at any time. So they need as many interceptors as they can get.""Ultimately, experts suggested the new THAAD controversy from Seoul over additional launchers benefits China because it creates friction in the U.S.-South Korean alliance.""China likes to use the North Korean threat to drive a wedge between the Republic of Korea and the United States,"" said Tom Karako, a senior fellow of the International Security program and director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think-tank.At the same time, North Korea's latest ballistic missile test on Monday added to growing concerns about the threats posed by the Pyongyang regime.""This would be a terrible time for the United States, or really a bilateral alliance here, to go wobbly on this very important deployment of THAAD,"" he said.U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis is expected to discuss the North Korean nuclear and missile threat as well as China's military build-up in the South China Sea later this week when he addresses an Asia Security Summit in Singapore, an event sponsored by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a defense think-tank.  Also scheduled to attend the IISS security summit is South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo. The Yonhap news agency reported that Mattis and Han will meet on the sidelines of the event and likely will discuss both the North Korea issue and THAAD. The bilateral meeting will set the stage for President Donald Trump and South Korea's Moon to meet later this month at the White House.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/china-gravely-concerned-about-reports-of-secret-thaad-launcher-delivery.html

There's a weariness in oil markets that we've been hearing for many months now that the market was about to tighten, that those global oil stocks were about to fall and it didn't really happen,"" Coleman told on Thursday.Coleman's comments came after oil prices fell to their lowest level in three weeks on Wednesday following data showing that monthly OPEC production rose for the first time this year during May. This helped Brent to notch up its fifth consecutive monthly loss and WTI to post its third straight monthly drop.Both commodities were trading higher again in Thursday's session with Brent recovering by 0.93 percent to $51.22 a barrel by 08:00 a.m. London time and WTI just shy of 1 percent higher at $48.79 a barrel. Some oil bulls are pinning near-term hopes for a rise in the oil price on seasonal factors which, according to Coleman, include an uptick in demand as the U.S. summer driving season kicks off and Saudi Arabians turn up their air conditioning.The volatility in the oil price during May reflected an initial build up and then dashing of overegged expectations that the oil cartel would secure deeper measures than the nine-month extension of its existing OPEC-led deal. Strong efforts to comply with the deal by many OPEC members have been partly undone recently by increases in production by countries with exemptions, such as Libya and Nigeria.Meantime, Coleman questioned how long the deal can really hold with many member states having a lot of opportunity to play for.""OPEC is competing internally for the Asian market and they are seeing a lot of oil coming from new sources into Asia from the U.S., from the North Sea, from Kazakhstan. Can these individual OPEC countries really maintain their oil production constraint at the risk of losing market share in Asia?"" he asked.Additionally, there's an ""uneasy stand-off"" underway between OPEC and U.S. shale producers, many of whom have comprehensively restructured balance sheets and bounced back from the low points they had sunk to a few years ago.""In the U.S. those shale producers are looking in pretty good shape now. They've paid off their debts and every little rise in the oil price encourages them to increase their production. They're very confident, I think, that they can further increase American production,"" asserted the oil specialist.Given the average time lag between putting a new shale well into operation and seeing oil pumped out of it is around six months, the uplift in oil drilling in recent months is likely to mean that shale production will continue at least for the rest of this year.""That cancels out to some extent OPEC's efforts,"" Coleman added.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

371,LeBron James means a lot to Cleveland \xe2\x80\x94 and its economy,Sports,01-06-2017,"Cleveland Cavaliers Lebron James celebrates with the crowd during a parade to celebrate winning the 2016 NBA Championship in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, U.S. June 22, 2016.Aaron Josefczyk | ReutersLeBron James, the most dominant basketball player of his generation and perhaps the game's most gifted creator on the court, is also a historic force at creating ... jobs.That's right. Wherever the three-time NBA champion goes, businesses and jobs follow. Some economists with the American Enterprise Institute quantified his impact in  new research published last month.One of the allures of professional sports is ostensibly the economic benefits for their home cities. Team owners, though usually billionaires themselves, often make that case when they ask local taxpayers to pony up hundreds of millions or billions of dollars to fund new stadiums and arenas.More from Vox: Rolling back the birth control mandate is part of a much larger GOP strategy The legal risks of Jared Kushner's meeting with a Russian banker, explained The GOP's ""Hillary Slayer"" will soon be in charge of investigating Trump in the HouseSome researchers have argued that new sports facilities don't have any economic upside \xe2\x80\x94 and might actually have a negative influence. Roger Noll of Stanford University and Andrew Zimbalist of Smith College  devoted much of their book on sports economics to that issue.But a generational talent and cultural phenom like James? The economic benefits he brings are very real, according to research by Daniel Shoag and Stan Veuger, who wrote their analysis for AEI.(This is where I should disclose, I suppose, that I grew up 90 minutes south of Cleveland and have rooted for James and the Cavaliers since he came into the league in 2003. James and the Cavs, defending NBA champions, face the Golden State Warriors for the third consecutive NBA Finals, starting tonight.)Shoag and Veuger place their analysis in that broader context of whether sports actually benefit their local economies, as well as building on recent research that superstars do increase attendance at sporting events. James's career also provides a tidy economic experiment, because he spent his first seven years in Cleveland, left for Miami for four years, and then returned to Cleveland in 2014.Here is how they summarize their findings:""We find that Mr. James has a statistically and economically significant positive effect on both the number of restaurants and other eating and drinking establishments near the stadium where he is based, and on aggregate employment at those establishments.""Specifically, James's presence increased the number of restaurants and bars within one mile of his team's arena by 13 percent, they found, and increased employment at those establishments by 23.5 percent.The effects were felt most strongly within one mile of the arena, started to dissipate but were still present within seven miles, and then disappeared completely. So the LeBron Effect is real, but it is fairly limited to the areas near where he plays basketball. The outreaches of the Cleveland and Miami metropolitans areas were not seeing much of a benefit.James also giveth and taketh away \xe2\x80\x94 and not only for fans, who (I can attest) were ecstatic when he came, distraught when he left, and overjoyed when he returned.Look at these two charts, showing the number of eating and drinking joints within one mile of the Cleveland and Miami arenas. Remember, James was in Cleveland from 2006 to 2010, then in Miami from 2010 to 2014, and back in Cleveland from 2014 to now.The dots tell the tale. The number of establishments near Cleveland's Quicken Loans Arena fell from more than 190 during James's first tenure, to less than 170 after he left, and then spiked to more than 210 upon his return. In Miami, the number of bars and restaurants near American Airlines Arena steadily increased while James was there, hitting a high of 250-plus, before falling off slightly after James returned to Cleveland.Of course, while the pattern is clear, James can't take all the credit \xe2\x80\x94 he doesn't dominate a local economy in the same way he dominates a basketball game. Shoag and Veuger did their best to isolate the LeBron Effect and concluded his specific influence was felt far more in Cleveland than in Miami.""Two potential explanations come to mind. Perhaps Mr. James is particularly beloved in his native Ohio,"" they wrote. ""Or maybe 'superstar amenities' are substitutes, not complements, and Miami has plenty of them even without Mr. James, generating fiercer competition and an attenuated impact of any specific superstar.""I'm going with the first one.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/lebron-james-means-a-lot-to-cleveland--and-its-economy.html
372,Trump: US is withdrawing from Paris climate agreement but wants to renegotiate,Politics,01-06-2017,"VIDEO0:5800:58President Trump withdraws from Paris Climate agreementNews VideosPresident Donald Trump said Thursday that the United States will withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement.Trump also said he would start talks to re-enter the accord with what he called a more ""fair"" deal, but was immediately rebuked by several European governments.The decision sets the world's largest economy apart from almost all other nations on Earth, and moves in opposition to many large American companies, as well. Always a showman, Trump announced the decision in a heavily teased event at the White House Rose Garden, where administration officials and conservatives applauded the move.""In order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord, but begin negotiations to re-enter either the Paris accord or an entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers,"" Trump said. VIDEO2:4902:49Pruitt: This is a restoration of American economic independence Closing Bell""So we're getting out,"" Trump said, ""but we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that's fair. And if we can that's great, and if we can't that's fine."" The governments of Germany, Italy and France \xe2\x80\x94 the three largest economies in the European Union \xe2\x80\x94 immediately threw out that idea. They released a joint statement Thursday saying they ""firmly believe"" that the accord can't be renegotiated, Reuters reported.  Trump cannot technically pull out of the agreement until November 2019, and the U.S. must give a year's notice before it can withdraw, according to reports. So a withdrawal may not take effect until 2020, though mechanisms exist to possibly speed the process. The White House contends that the U.S. has already reduced its carbon dioxide emissions and does not need the Paris accord to cut them even more, according to talking points obtained by CNBC. Obama: Other countries will get the new jobsIn a statement after Trump's announcement, his predecessor, President Barack Obama, said that the countries still in the Paris deal ""will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created."" He said he believes state governments and the private sector will still push to cut emissions \xe2\x80\x94 and indeed, most U.S. states are moving forward on fighting carbon pollution without Washington.VIDEO6:3606:36I think it's a loss to US business for us to withdraw: Princeton professorClosing Bell""I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack. But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got,"" Obama said.In defending the decision to yank the U.S. out of the agreement, Trump cited a series of figures provided by a consulting firm that does work for the energy industry.Trump said the Paris Agreement would cost the United States 2.7 million jobs by 2025 and shave trillions from the U.S. economy, citing the numbers generated by NERA Economic Consulting.The White House also said the agreement could cost the U.S. economy ""nearly $3 trillion over the next several decades,"" citing the same study.That report was prepared for the American Council for Capital Formation, a conservative think tank whose board includes prominent Republicans and representatives from industry trade groups. The report does not take into account potential benefits from emissions reductions or future technology that could influence costs over the long term.Trump warned of ""brownouts"" as well, without providing any information to back that claim.US businesses support Paris dealCEOs of some of the largest U.S.-based companies disagree with the president and his backers. They say the Paris Agreement gives them a level playing field to compete with foreign rivals and would grow the economy and create jobs by encouraging investment in new technology.A number of large American companies were among those advocating for staying in the Paris Agreement, including U.S. energy giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron and their European peers Royal Dutch Shell and BP. The oil majors say the accord offers a framework for tackling global warming and gives the United States a role in steering the global response to climate change.Even some coal producers like Cloud Peak Energy and Peabody Energy argued the United States should remain a party in order to negotiate coal's future in the global energy mix.CEOs of companies like Apple and Microsoft, among many others, also pushed Trump to uphold the agreement.Tesla CEO Elon Musk \xe2\x80\x94 a Paris deal proponent whose company also benefits from a shift to renewable energy sources \xe2\x80\x94 immediately carried out his threat to leave three White House advisory councils after Trump spoke in the Rose Garden.Most of the planet on board with Paris dealMore than two decades of climate diplomacy produced the Paris Agreement in December 2015. The treaty is designed to prevent global temperatures from rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The accord requires the 195 signatories \xe2\x80\x94 nearly every country in the world \xe2\x80\x94 to create national plans to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in a bid to mitigate the effects of climate change.Syria and Nicaragua are the only countries in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that are not signatories.Under Obama, the United States committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by between 26 and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.

This year's survey took place at the end of 2016, just after U.S. President Donald Trump had been elected, and shortly after the U.K.'s  Brexit and Brazil's presidential impeachment.Threats to freedom, democracy and institutions in society that people rely on affect people immediately and their view of the future for their family and children.Neal Rubinprofessor of international psychology at the Illinois School of Professional PsychologyThe reasons driving responses to the survey question depend on individual circumstances and personalities, says Dr. Neal Rubin, a professor of international psychology at the Illinois School of Professional Psychology. While economic inequality is growing, progress has been made against the United Nations' development goals, especially in terms of fighting disease, hunger and education inequality.For those with a declinist sentiment, he says, fear and anxiety about the future may be in play.""Safety and being able to maintain a way of life may feel under threat,"" he says. ""Threats to freedom,  democracy and institutions in society that people rely on affect people immediately and their view of the future for their family and children.""Of the 36 countries surveyed, negative responses were strongest in Turkey, which recently faced an attempted military coup. More than 80 percent of people surveyed in Turkey said that the world had become worse in the past year.Modernization, with rapidly increasing globalization and urbanization, is also linked to anxiety about the future, Rubin says.""As society is modernized and ways of life change, people have to adapt to the new ways in which society structures life and socioeconomic status plays into identities,"" he says. ""The loss of cultural roots and traditions and changes in identity can lead to alienation, depression and hopelessness about ways to adapt to future.""But sometimes, it seems, money can buy happiness, or at least a more positive outlook. Survey respondents in India and China, two countries that have reaped some of the greatest economic benefits of globalization, were most likely to look back on the past year positively.

That's the biggest month-to-month drop ever recorded by Spectrem Group, a Chicago-based wealth-research firm that created the index. The survey found that almost 4 in 10 (39 percent) of millionaires plan to avoid investing in the coming month \xe2\x80\x94 the highest percentage since December 2013. The main reason for the drop: politics and the turmoil surrounding the Trump administration. The top concern cited by the millionaires surveyed was the political environment. ""Even though the stock market remains at near-record high levels, millionaire investors are becoming increasingly cautious,"" said Spectrem President George H. Walper Jr. ""This is likely due to growing concerns about the weakening political position of President Trump given recent controversies, the declining likelihood of substantive tax reform in the near term, as well as concerns about the recently submitted proposed federal budget.""""Although nonmillionaires also recorded a drop in confidence, the fact they are slightly more confident now than millionaires is a strong indication that we may be entering a tumultuous period for investors,"" Walper said. The political pessimism among millionaires is not being driven by Democrats, which would be predictable. The largest drop in the survey came among Republican millionaires.""The Republican millionaires may believe they delivered the House, Senate and presidency and still nothing is getting done, which ultimately may impact their economic views. They are worried that government dysfunction, which they identify as the most significant threat to the economy, could jeopardize both health care and the important tax cuts that may be fueling part of the stock market surge,"" he said. Of course, the stock market has continued to rally in recent weeks, which doesn't suggest a panic among millionaires. And the survey is just a one-month snapshot. But since millionaires own the bulk of the stocks and financial assets in the U.S., their fear could put a damper on stock-market growth in the coming weeks and months.

Economists surveyed by Reuters expected the report to show that private payrolls grew by 185,000 in May from 174,000 in April.The growth ""is three times the rate of the growth in the underlying labor force,"" Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, told CNBC. ""So that means the unemployment rate, which is 4.4 percent, is quickly headed to 4 percent. This labor market is rip-roaring and getting really tight.""Services broadly led the way with 205,000 new jobs, with professional and business services contributing 88,000 \xe2\x80\x94 its best month in about three years \xe2\x80\x94 and education and health services adding 54,000.Construction added 37,000 as the building season kicks into full gear, while manufacturing grew by 8,000 and there were 3,000 new mining jobs. Mining has been one of the cornerstones of President Donald Trump's economic agenda, though critics doubt he can fulfill campaign promises to bring jobs back to the industry.Trade, transportation and utilities was another big growth area, with 58,000 positions, while franchises add 18,400 new workers.The two areas showing losses were leisure and hospitality, which posted a rare decline of 11,000, and information services, which fell by 8,000.In all, it was the fourth time this year and sixth in tseven months that the ADP count put total job creation above 200,000. Over the past 12 months, private payroll growth has averaged 211,000. April's count was revised down by 3,000.The report comes amid a growing chorus of economists who doubt the Trump administration can achieve its goal of 3 percent annual GDP growth in part because the labor market is reaching full employment. Despite a 4.4 percent unemployment rate, there have been only limited inflation pressures, with the Labor Department reporting hourly wage growth of 2.5 percent in April.The ADP report serves as a precursor to Friday's nonfarm payrolls count from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Payroll growth is expected to come in around 176,000, down from the previous month's 211,000. Economists occasionally will adjust their estimates off the ADP numbers, though the two counts can have wide disparities.According to ADP, medium-sized businesses, with 50 to 499 employees, accounted for the most growth \xe2\x80\x94 113,000 new jobs.

He ran again in 2008 and when he came up short, Barack Obama offered him the consolation prize of the vice presidency.Obama, then a freshman senator, wanted to balance his ticket with an elder statesmen like Biden, who by then had chaired both the Senate Foreign Relations and Judiciary Committees and had a number of major pieces of legislation to his name, such as the Violence Against Women Act.But while Biden was one of the youngest people ever elected to the Senate, he would be the oldest president at 78 years old, if he ran and won. He's only four years older than President Donald Trump, but even many Democrats would prefer to see a fresher face rise up to challenge Trump.Still, after so many years in the party, plenty of other Democrats would be happy to see Biden as their nominee, and think he could connect with the white, working class voters who abandoned the party for Trump last year.""I think he does miss it today.

386,Trump budget proposal has many US farmers reeling,Economy,01-06-2017,"VIDEO0:5700:57Trump budget proposal has many US farmers reelingNews VideosOn one medium-sized farm in western Kansas, fourth-generation farmer Derek Sawyer is doing all he can to stay afloat. He has 2,500 acres of land and about 700 cows, but looming on the horizon is a White House budget proposal that would cut $38 billion in subsidies to farmers like him.President Trump's budget would slash several programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture \xe2\x80\x94 including crop insurance \xe2\x80\x94 that farmers say have been a lifeline in recent years. About $28 billion is on the chopping block from crop insurance alone.Sawyer's Land & Cattle grows wheat, corn and soybeans. Sawyer took out his first crop insurance after his grandfather passed away and said he wouldn't be farming right now if it weren't for the protection.""It's definitely not a program that helps you get rich,"" Sawyer said. ""But crop insurance will come close to helping us cover the expenses of the crop.""The program helps farmers afford the cost of buying insurance for their crops. According to Montana State University economics professor Vincent Smith, crop insurance premiums total about $9.5 billion annually. The federal government currently covers about 60 percent of the cost, or $6 billion. Farmers contribute the rest.It has been really rough the past couple of years. We're looking at corn and wheat prices that are roughly half of what we were seeing five or six years ago.Derek SawyerKansas farmerThe president's budget calls for capping crop insurance subsidies at $40,000 per farmer, saving $16.2 billion over a decade. The administration argues that farmers don't need an incentive to participate in crop insurance, because it's already an integral part of their business models. Separately, the White House proposal would cut nearly $12 billion from a safety net known as the harvest price option that provides a buffer to farmers facing a harvest shortfall.""The goal of this proposal is to optimize the current crop insurance program so that it will continue to provide a quality safety net at a lower cost,"" the administration said in its budget.But the American Farm Bureau, an industry lobbying group, said the proposal would ""gut"" the crop insurance program. The group's chief economist, Bob Young, said kicking people out of the pool could make insurance more expensive. Young said family farms would likely be affected. He said farms bigger than 1,400 acres \xe2\x80\x94 like Sawyer's \xe2\x80\x94 account for about two-thirds of corn production.Grain truck offloads freshly cut wheat at Sawyer Land & Cattle.Source: Kyle E. Arnold, Arnold Sound & VideoThe White House budget also calls for eliminating subsidies to farmers with revenue of more than $500,000 a year. The current limit is $900,000, Smith said. If enacted, the proposal would save $653 million over 10 years. Young said farm revenue is down about 50 percent from 2014 because of lower commodity prices.""To come in and get this kind of a whack, the sector would really feel it,"" he said.At Sawyer's farm, annual revenue for the past several years has been about $3 million, but Sawyer said his profit margin is razor-thin. It took a record wheat crop last year just to break even, he said.""It has been really rough the past couple of years. We're looking at corn and wheat prices that are roughly half of what we were seeing five or six years ago,"" he said. ""We're looking at the cost of production on nearly all the crops exceeding the value of the crop at harvest.""Farmers pin hopes on CongressTo be sure, the White House budget is generally considered a wish list. The farmers are hoping relief will come when Congress writes its own version of the budget. In addition, lawmakers must renegotiate the 2014 Farm Bill, which is set to expire in September 2018. That bill was particularly bruising to farmers, slicing $23 billion from the Department of Agriculture over 10 years. The Farm Bureau called Trump's proposed cuts a magnitude higher.Although Congress is in recess this week, the House and Senate Agriculture committees have begun hearings on the Farm Bill reauthorization. When Congress returns next week, budget negotiations will begin in earnest.""We will fight to ensure farmers have a strong safety net so this key segment of our economy can weather current hard times and continue to provide all Americans with safe, affordable food,"" committee chairmen Rep. Mike Conaway, R.-Texas, and Sen. Pat Roberts, R.-Kan., said in a statement.VIDEO3:1703:17Should preserve Mexico relationship, open up markets in Canada: Fmr. Agriculture sec. Power LunchThe crop insurance program is run by the USDA's risk management agency. It was established in 1937 during President Franklin D. Roosevelt's second term, but subsidy payments jumped during the 1980s, according to Smith. There are about 2.1 million farms in the country, according to the Farm Bureau. Between 250,000 and 300,000 of them produce 80 percent of the nation's food. Most of the grain farms are family-managed operations, Young said, with family members providing most of the management and labor.Smith said about 85 to 90 percent of all crops are covered under the federal crop insurance program. Additionally, more than 90 percent of farms have substantial off-farm income, and many farmers use their land to offset their tax liability on other income.Sawyer said his community is already struggling. The neighborhood cafe is closed for hours during the day and shuts down a few days a week because of a lack of farmers coming in for lunch. His equipment dealer moved into a different industry because he could see that farm income was going to be tough and machinery sales were going down.Still, Sawyer said he is determined to stay on the land in McPherson County that his family has farmed for four generations. His 4-year-old son, Evan, was helping with harvesting grain and feeding cattle before he could even walk. Sawyer said he remains upbeat about his industry.""If I'm not optimistic, I'm in the wrong business,"" he said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/farm-subsidies-trump-budget-cuts-has-agriculture-industry-worried.html

397,Who really pays if Trump quits the Paris accord,Politics,01-06-2017,"Visions of America | Getty ImagesNo laid-off coal miners will get their jobs back if President Trump pulls the United States from the Paris accord on climate change. No extra oil rigs will sprout in the Gulf. There is no employment upside to an ""America First"" retreat from global leadership on one of the few issues that can accurately be described as a potentially existential threat to humankind.There is only the profound immorality of abdication \xe2\x80\x94 of gleefully passing a mounting problem on to our children, and on to the poor.Reports suggest Trump is set to fulfill a campaign promise and withdraw the US from the agreement, which aims to put the world on a path to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. Trump tweeted on Wednesday that he will announce a decision soon; when he makes it, he will almost certainly cast the departure in terms of job growth, particularly for the coal industry.@realDonaldTrump:  I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!More from Vox: Rolling back the birth control mandate is part of a much larger GOP strategy The legal risks of Jared Kushner's meeting with a Russian banker, explained The GOP's ""Hillary Slayer"" will soon be in charge of investigating Trump in the HouseThere is no evidence, though, to suggest the Paris deal is holding back coal or any other industry in America today. Trump's position amounts to nothing more than a dollop of false hope for downtrodden coal communities, in exchange for a ton of additional risk heaped on everyone, particularly the poorest people in the world.As more carbon accumulates in the atmosphere, and global average temperatures continue to rise, the odds of calamitous future environmental outcomes increase. Swamped cities, scorched crops, pandemics \xe2\x80\x94 nothing you would wish upon your children, or anyone else's""It is a decision made for domestic political purposes that puts the livelihood and lives of millions of people in developing countries at risk,"" says Trevor Houser, a former climate negotiator for President Barack Obama who is now a partner with the Rhodium Group. ""This is a craven, symbolic political move without any direct benefits for the constituents he's targeting.""The Paris agreement is only a step toward the reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions that scientists roundly agree is necessary in order to reduce the most catastrophic risks of climate change. But it is a crucial step, won through years of diplomatic grunt work, including a sustained effort to rebuild American climate credibility that had been torched by the Bush administration.It's morally reprehensible to walk away from climate action.\xc2\xa0 It's an act everyone will recall as kids gasp for air during heat waves, as homes are wiped out by larger storms, as larger fires displace homes, and as droughts lead to crop failure.Keya ChatterjeeUS Climate Action Network executive directorThe agreement will persist even if Trump pulls America from it, as he is reportedly set to do. But the accord will be weakened, and, much more importantly, so will the fragile international coalition to fight what Jason Bordoff, a Columbia professor and former climate adviser to Obama, calls ""one of the most global problems.""Ideally, the current administration would be pushing partner countries to strengthen their commitments under the agreement; instead, it is giving them an excuse to slack off.The decision will punish the poor\xc2\xa0For the global poor, the reduced ambition could prove disastrous. The World Bank estimates climate effects  could push 100 million people worldwide into poverty over the next 15 years. A  recent report from the Climate Impact Lab projects that the most damaging effects of climate change will be concentrated in ""hot, poor countries"" in regions such as Latin America and Southeast Asia, and in sub-Saharan Africa, where climate change is already associated with falling crop production due to record-setting drought.""In our benchmark estimate,"" the authors write, ""average income in the poorest 40% of countries declines 75% by 2100 relative to a world without climate change."" Richer, cooler countries in Europe tend to fare better, but, notably, not the United States. It would suffer economically \xe2\x80\x94 and on the international stage.""It's morally reprehensible to walk away from climate action,"" says Keya Chatterjee, the executive director of the US Climate Action Network. ""It's an act everyone will recall as kids gasp for air during heat waves, as homes are wiped out by larger storms, as larger fires displace homes, and as droughts lead to crop failure.""It won't create jobs\xc2\xa0Trump has said the agreement gives ""foreign bureaucrats"" control of America's energy reserves. (It doesn't.) He's cast it as a job killer. (It's not.) Many US corporations support the agreement, including some large oil and gas companies, like Exxon Mobil. Clean energy advocates worry that stepping away from the deal would hamstring renewables here, which are growing so fast that there are now  twice as many solar jobs as coal jobs in the US.""It's the equivalent of a president saying, 'There's no future for the US in medical research,'"" says Josh Freed, the clean energy vice president at the centrist think tank Third Way. ""The president is purposely giving up on an entire sector that could drive global economic growth.""The most notable corporate support for exiting the deal comes from the coal industry, which is hoping against hope \xe2\x80\x94 and the economics of low-cost natural gas \xe2\x80\x94 that a complete abandonment of emissions-reduction efforts will lead to an industry renaissance. It's a last gasp, and unlikely to work, as Houser and Bordoff  wrote in a detailed recent analysis.And it will hurt American leadershipOnce Trump quits the deal, he will inflict lasting damage on American foreign policy efforts, well beyond collaboration on environmental issues.The agreement is in many ways emblematic of how leaders in Washington \xe2\x80\x94 on both sides of the aisle \xe2\x80\x94 have long viewed America's role in the world. It does not commit the US to a go-it-alone effort. To the contrary: It leverages promised US emissions cuts to win pledges from the world's fastest-growing carbon polluters, China and India, as well as other Western and developing countries.By exiting, Trump would forfeit that leverage. He would return the US to its days of being distrusted by the international community on the issue, and further the belief, particularly in Europe, that America is an unreliable partner.A future administration could take steps to rejoin the agreement \xe2\x80\x94 or to reengage in global climate talks, if Trump walks away from them entirely. But the damage would linger. In Copenhagen in 2009, efforts to forge an international climate deal were hampered, in part, by the deep-rooted suspicion Obama's team (including Houser) faced from European, Chinese, and other negotiators in the wake of the Bush administration's foot-dragging on emissions reductions.It took years, and a batch of controversial regulations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, to rebuild that credibility and pave the way for Paris. To now quit that agreement would, Houser says, ""be the second time Lucy has pulled the football.""

402,Ditch the 4 percent rule. Here's how to handle your retirement withdrawals,"Your Money, Your Future",01-06-2017,"So you have amassed a nest egg large enough to retire. Now comes the hard part: figuring out how much you should withdraw each year to enjoy life and make sure you don't run out of money.It can be a difficult balance. Many investors simply use the 4 percent rule. Under this scenario, you withdraw 4 percent per year from a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds, adjusting annually for inflation, and you will have enough to last for 30 years in retirement, based on historical returns of the U.S. stock market.The problem with the 4 percent rule, which was developed in the 1990s, is that portfolio losses in the early years of retirement would make following it unsafe for many retirees, according to research by Wade Pfau, a professor of retirement income at the American College of Financial Services.VIDEO1:3601:36Top retirement mythsYour Money, Your FutureStudies have shown that retirees are actually more frugal than the 4 percent rule would indicate. They leave behind a similar amount of wealth regardless of what age they die, and older people become steadily more pessimistic about their own future economic prospects.Some financial advisors recommend people scrap the 4 percent rule altogether.""We don't use safe withdrawal rates \xe2\x80\x94 ever,"" said Craig Larsen, a certified financial planner and founder of AHC Advisors in St. Charles, Illinois. ""We feel that this deprives those in their earlier retirement years of life experiences, and those individuals don't get a second chance at their early retirement years.""Instead we build a financial plan that helps them achieve their spending goals, and update it every year,"" he added.When building your own plan for retirement income, there are three things to consider.Life expectancyWhat makes finding the right level of retirement income each year so difficult is that you don't know how long you will live.The Social Security Administration estimates that a man reaching age 65 today can expect to live on average until age 84 and the average 65-year-old woman would live until age 87. Roughly one out of every four 65-year-olds today will live past age 90 and 10 percent will live past age 95.But those are simply averages. ""And in reality, someone who has a family history of long lives can herself have a short life,"" said Barry Kozak, an estate lawyer at October Three Consulting in Chicago. ""No one can ever plan on life expectancy, and should always overestimate how long they will live.""More from Your Money Your Future:Survive your boomerang kids without depleting your retirement savingsFrugal retirees ditch 4 percent rule, hoard savings insteadHealth savings account contributions can boost your retirementSocial Security benefitsWorking longer to maximize your Social Security benefits is the lowest-cost path to guaranteed income you can find in retirement. ""Social Security benefits do have a cost-of-living adjustment, so at least that source keeps up with inflation,"" Kozak said.The average monthly Social Security benefit right now is $1,360, while the maximum monthly payout for someone who is age 70 and has worked for at least 35 years is $3,538 in 2017.Social Security benefits grow roughly 8 percent for every year you delay past age 62, the earliest year you can claim. However, most people file for benefits before they reach their full retirement age, or the age at which their benefits aren't reduced. (See table below.)TaxesDrawing down retirement assets can be more difficult than building your nest egg because taxes are trickier.Your tax liability depends on your retirement accounts. Any withdrawals you make from your traditional individual retirement accounts and 401(k) plans are taxed as ordinary income, while the money you pull out from your Roth accounts is tax-free. Watch out for required minimum distributions for traditional IRAs and workplace retirement plans. If you don't make the appropriate withdrawals, you may have to pay a 50 percent tax on the amount that was not taken out as required.Generally, you have to start taking withdrawals from your traditional IRA, SIMPLE IRA, SEP IRA or retirement plan accounts when you reach age 70\xc2\xbd. If you are still working, some 401(k) plans allow you to defer RMDs from those plans until you retire. (See chart below.)""Traditional thinking is to wait until 70\xc2\xbd to start taking IRA and qualified plan distributions and then take the RMD,"" said Todd Minear, a CFP and founder of Open Road Wealth Management in Kansas City, Missouri. ""However, for many retirees, it could make sense to begin these taxable distributions earlier than that, making future distributions smaller.""The goal should be to manage distributions from all your taxable, tax-deferred and Roth accounts in a way keep you in the lowest tax bracket as possible. ""One of the biggest mistakes people make when drawing down for retirement is not being tax-efficient,"" Minear said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/heres-how-to-handle-your-retirement-withdrawals.html

""I think we should be cautious. We should be conservative and we should consider some inflationary risks,"" Elvira Nabiullina, governor of the Central Bank of Russia, told CNBC when asked about how stabilizing oil prices could affect the bank's benchmark rates.  She added that it was ""very difficult"" to predict the dynamic of oil prices for the longer term, mentioning a potential rise in shale oil production, but suggested that the bank could revise higher its baseline scenario for oil to trade at $40 a barrel.  ""We should be very conservative in our monetary policy. We cut our interest rates and I think we have room for easing more but the pace of this easing will depend on the economic situation, on actual inflation, on inflationary expectations, on the dynamic of oil prices,"" she said.

Nabiullina stated that the target was for inflation to hit, and remain close to, 4 percent by the end of this year with her comments underlining that the bank is carefully watching whether this drop in inflation is only a temporary phenomena.  She highlighted that the bank's own internal research indicates that a nominal interest rate of around 6.5 percent would suffice if inflation stays near 4 percent. Its key rate is currently 9.25 percent after two cuts this year already.  ""We have this elevated inflation expectation. They are not anchored, they're higher than our target. That's why we are trying to keep this toughness of our policy to achieve our target for medium term. Of course we see some inflationary risks related to the dynamic of oil prices \xe2\x80\x93 now they are quite high but who knows that dynamic of oil price is not very predictable we can say.""Overcome the effect of sanctions?Moscow has become accustomed to tolerating U.S. imposed economic sanctions, Russia's central bank governor told CNBC in the exclusive interview.

""GT's business is powertrain-agnostic, has low obsolescence risk, is not exposed to used car prices, and can benefit from shared and automated driving,"" Jonas wrote in the note to clients Thursday entitled ""More miles = more tires.""""We have high conviction that [shared transportation] mobility is a deflationary business that produces an unprecedented growth in vehicle miles traveled.

408,Financial cheat sheet for new college grads,College Game Plan ,31-05-2017,"In a more perfect academic environment, every college diploma handed out would come with a user's manual for navigating the new world of financial obligations, since money moves made \xe2\x80\x94 and avoided \xe2\x80\x94 in your 20s will reverberate for decades.VIDEO1:1701:17How to deal with college debtCollege Game Plan ""The amounts you save matter less right now than the habits you form,"" said Ryan Frailich, founder of Deliberate Finances, a New Orleans-based advisory firm.""If you get in the habit of having credit-card debt, that will follow you for a long time. If you get in the habit of just living paycheck to paycheck, that becomes your norm. The key at the start is to develop habits that will pay off for the rest of your life.""Here's how to get a great start:Ace your student loan repayment. Yes, there is a six-month grace period after you leave school before the first payment is due. Do not wait five months and 29 days to get your payments set up. Late payments will incur fees and good God, the last thing you want is to fall into that.Being late will mess with your credit score (more on that in a sec), and can ultimately end with the government stepping in and pulling the money from your paycheck (called ""wage garnishment"" in debt-collection circles.) If you have federal loans you can choose from multiple repayment plans some that stretch payments out for a few decades.College finance expert Mark Kantrowitz recommends trying to stick with the standard 10-year repayment plan, so you can polish off this debt and move on to other financial goals sooner than later.Know where it's going. Now that you're making money, the best habit you will ever form is to spend less than what is coming in. ""Having a budget is the foundation for everything,"" said Justin Nichols, chief planning officer at CGN Advisors in Manhattan, Kansas. Consider using  a budgeting app to stay on top of your cash flow.Automate, automate, automate! Even if you were class valedictorian, you are still human. And when it comes to financial commitments, humans make mistakes. Bills get paid late, money that you planned to set aside in an emergency savings account or earmark for a Roth IRA gets waylaid.""Ideally you want to treat saving as a monthly expense that is built into your budget, and the best way to do that is to set up automated transfers,"" said Nichols. Yet a recent SoFi survey found that less than half of young adults take advantage of automated savings:Build a $1,000 safety net ASAP. Yes, it's wise to have an emergency fund that can cover three to six months of living expenses. It's also not exactly practical right at the outset. Understood. But push yourself to sock away $1,000 in a bank or credit union savings account. (Automated savings of $25 a week will get you there in less than a year.) That's what helps you cover an unexpected expense without having to put it on a credit card that charges 15 percent or more interest.Skip the wheels of fortune. If you need a car, aim to spend the least amount possible to get a reliable car. That's because a car is a lousy investment, or what is called a ""depreciating asset"" among financial types. If you need a loan, Nichols suggests you aim for no more than a three-year term. ""Anything longer is a sign you are stretching to buy an expensive car.""Zimmytws | iStock | Getty ImagesMake the most of making more. You're likely at the low point of your earnings power. As you begin to snag raises, promotions and income-shifting job changes, Frailich suggests an 80/20 strategy for your newfound riches. Aim to use 80 percent of any extra income for a financial goal \xe2\x80\x94 paying off debt, boosting savings \xe2\x80\x94 and give yourself the remaining 20 percent to spend or save as you please. ""As you make more you want to make sure you don't fall into too much lifestyle creep. Giving yourself the freedom to spend 20 percent keeps that in check,"" said Frailich. Employ the same strategy as you pay off loans. Earmark at least 80 percent of the monthly payment that used to go toward that debt for another financial goal.Shoot for a 10 percent retirement savings rate. Getting to a 10 percent deferral rate as soon as possible will give you a ton of money 30 or 40 years from now. If you have a company match, make sure you contribute enough to get the maximum match. And if there's a  Roth 401(k) offered, take that over a traditional 401(k). No match? Open a Roth IRA at a discount brokerage. You can save up to $5,500 this year in a Roth IRA.Get a credit card. A survey by Bankrate.com finds young adults are not exactly grooving to the notion of becoming part of credit card nation.Not wanting to get sucked into the world of high-rate credit card debt is admirable, yet a sad fact of your new financial reality is that building a  strong credit score is important. Your payment history on a credit card is a major factor in calculating your credit score; your debit card spending does zilch for your credit score. Once you have a credit card only charge what you can afford to pay off in full each month.Protect your biggest asset. Right now your most valuable asset is your human capital: the decades of earnings power you have ahead of you. Nichols recommends checking out the long-term disability coverage offered by an employer as a way to safeguard a chunk of your income if you were no longer able to work.

409,Hiring in May is expected to be strong for college grads and everyone else,Market Insider,01-06-2017,"Columbia University has yielded 38 of today's billionairesXinhua News Agency | Getty ImagesHiring in May is expected to have been strong, with 185,000 jobs created and unemployment steady at a low 4.4 percent.But wage growth is expected to remain sluggish, improving just 0.2 percent over April.Friday's employment report, however, is expected to show that gains in hiring were broad-based. Business and professional hiring, as well as construction and possibly manufacturing and retail \xe2\x80\x94 a recent area of weakness \xe2\x80\x94 are all expected to show improvement.""The good news is this is the best college grad year in a decade. We should see full-time hires pick up,"" said Diane Swonk, CEO of DS Economics. A recent Korn Ferry survey showed salaries for new college graduates at an all-time high. But economists are closely watching the average hourly wages in the jobs report for signs of a pickup. Economists expect to see gains of just 0.2 per cent month over month, after a 0.3 percent increase last month, according to Thomson Reuters data. That would equal about a 2.6 percent yearly gain when the Federal Reserve would like to see 3 percent. Rising wages are an early sign of inflation.  Swonk expects to see unemployment rise to 4.5 percent because more people will be joining the work force. ""We're pulling people in,"" she said, noting the state of Maine is talking about releasing prisoners to fill summer jobs.""Those are all signs that they're broadening the pool,"" Swonk added. She expects 180,000 payrolls.Deutsche Bank chief U.S. economist Joseph LaVorgna expects to see 235,000 jobs added in May, well above the 185,000 consensus, reported by Thomson Reuters.""It's going to be very broad-based. Generally speaking, when you get a number well above 200,000, you tend to see a lot of areas do well, like manufacturing and construction,"" he said. LaVorgna also said he expects retail, hit by store closings, to stabilize and add some jobs.LaVorgna expects an increase of 0.2 percent in hourly wages.""Wages are rising, but not very quickly. My guess is you'll see further grinding improvement, but not one that causes market expectations of inflation to meaningfully shift,"" said LaVorgna. ""However, if there is an upward swing in the wage number, with a solid report, the market could get a little more nervous.""Markets, and the bond market in particular, have been full of speculation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates just one more time this year because of lower inflation. A jump in wages could stir up the bond market, where yields have been moving mostly lower. Stocks were poised to open higher after the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all closed at record levels Thursday. Yields, which move opposite prices, were barely changed. The 10-year was at 2.20 percent.Goldman Sachs economists expect just 170,000 payrolls. They raised their forecast by 10,000 after ADP reported private sector payrolls of 253,000 Thursday morning.The economists said they believe that there was an artificial boost in April's job numbers, which saw 211,000 payrolls after bad weather subtracted from March employment gains. That could moderate in May.Many economists believe the labor market has tightened so much that monthly job growth will be more in line with the 185,000 expected than a number of more than 200,000. In a tightening labor market, companies have difficulty finding employees with the right skills.Goldman economists said that payroll growth tends to slow during the late spring in years with tight labor markets.""Labor constraints appear particularly binding in May [and August] in these years. One potential explanation is that the May payroll period occurs after much of the start-of-year seasonal slack has been wound down [earlier in the Spring hiring season] but before the entry of students and recent graduates into the labor force [in late May and June],"" they wrote.Besides the employment report, international trade is also released at 8:30 a.m. ET.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/hiring-in-may-is-expected-to-be-strong-for-college-grads-and-everyone-else.html
410,"Mixed drinks, beer and cider volumes slip as wine grows slightly",Food & Beverage,01-06-2017,"Hero Images | Getty ImagesLiquid consumption of beer, cider and mixed drinks was down last year in the U.S., and lower-priced brands faced a tougher time with consumers, according to a new report.At the same time, tequila posted record volumes for the year and its growth beat most other beverage alcohol categories, according to IWSR's 2016 U.S. Beverage Alcohol Review.Overall, the IWSR report found total beverage alcohol consumption growth domestically last year was down less than 1 percent, when measured in nine-liter case equivalents. However, it predicted ""a return to growth for total U.S. beverage alcohol"" starting in 2018 and sees the category reaching a compound annual growth rate of 0.2 percent by 2021.Wine volumes on an absolute basis grew 1.1 percent in 2016 and IWSR credited ""the strength of premium-and-above varietals such as pinot noir, rose, cabernet sauvignon, red blends and sauvignon blanc.""Last year marked the wine industry's 22nd consecutive year of volume growth, and wines priced above $10 outperformed the category with volume growth of more than 7 percent. ""The growth in higher-priced wine continues a premiumization trend that we've seen since 1994,"" said Rob McMillan, executive vice president and founder of Silicon Valley Bank's wine division. ""You see the same premiumization trend in craft beer and spirits as well.""McMillan said it was the Baby Boomer generation that ""started the train of moving into premium"" and now the younger generation of drinking-age consumers is continuing with it.As for beer, it's probably no surprise that domestic volume and sales trends have been sluggish, particularly for the large brewers, including Anheuser-Busch InBev. In the first quarter alone, the brewer's North America sales fell 2.1 percent and volumes dipped 4.4 percent.IWSR's data shows the domestic beer category's total volumes were down 1.5 percent in 2016. When excluding the craft segment, though, the decline would have been 2.8 percent.That said, craft along with imports are doing better than the overall beer category.""We had beer volumes on an absolute level as pretty flat last year,"" said Bart Watson, chief economist at the Brewers Association.Watson said the trade association's figures show craft beer volumes rose 6 percent last year but that growth was slower than in the past.""There's cluttered shelves, and tap handles are more competitive than ever, so that's slowing [craft] growth,"" the industry economist said. ""We're seeing some choke points in distribution too.""Cider is another category seeing challenges. It had previously benefited from a halo effect of the gluten-free trend and increased consumption by younger women, particularly for the fruit-flavored ciders.According to IWSR, ""the cider category skyrocketed the past three years"" and reached an all-time high in volume growth in 2015 only to decline by 15.1 percent last year.Distilled spirits ended the year with volumes up by 2.6 percent and gaining a slight share in total beverage alcohol, IWSR said. It said the overall mixed drinks category fell 3.2 percent last year.Whisky's total volume growth beat the overall distilled spirits category. Bourbon volumes rose 6.4 percent last year, and imported whisky posted a 3.4 percent pace. Even so, IWSR said scotch posted its ""lowest growth rate among all imported whisky categories with an increase of 0.5 percent.""Tequila turned in impressive volume growth of 7.4 percent in 2016, setting an all-time high with 16.3 million cases and garnering a 7.5 percent share of overall spirits.Gin bounced back last year, growing 1 percent in volume after consecutive years of decline. The growth was led by premium brands in addition to high-end imports.One casualty of changing consumer tastes in alcohol beverages is rum. ""The rum category posted a decline of 1.2 percent as consumer interest has shifted to whisky and tequila,"" said IWSR.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/mixed-drinks-beer-and-cider-volumes-slip-as-wine-grows-slightly.html
411,Motorola's newest modular smartphone \xe2\x80\x94 the Moto Z2 Play \xe2\x80\x94 is a lot of fun,Tech,01-06-2017,"VIDEO2:2502:25The Moto Z2 Play has fun phone attachments to add new features to your smartphoneDigital OriginalThe Moto Z2 Play is a new affordable Android that allows you to attach various magnetic ""mods"" to add new features to the smartphone.Mods let you attach a speaker for louder music, a battery pack to give you the charge boost you need and even add new functions, like wireless charging.Todd Haselton | CNBCThe idea isn't new, but the fact that Motorola is sticking with it shows there's a future in this space. Motorola Mobility (owned by Lenovo) and LG have launched so-called modular smartphones.Motorola, to its credit, has done a much better job offering a larger choice of modular components that are easier to pop on and off its smartphones. Several are already available, including a Hasselblad camera attachment that allows you to shoot better photos, a speaker, a projector, various battery packs and more.The Moto Z2 Play is the latest such Motorola phone to support these mods. I've been using it for the past few days, and I really like where Motorola's heading.Refinements with a focus on battery lifeTodd Haselton | CNBCThe Moto Z2 Play isn't the most powerful Android smartphone on the planet, but it doesn't have to be. Last year's Z Play made its name for great performance and solid battery life, both without requiring the ""latest and greatest"" Snapdragon chip from Qualcomm. The Moto Z2 Play continues that legacy by offering an easy day-and-a-half or more of battery life on a single charge, making it an especially compelling option for road warriors who forget to charge their smartphones at night.There's a bright and large display on the Moto Z2 Play, though it isn't as sharp as other options like the Galaxy S8, and it doesn't run from edge to edge, like on more expensive phones. This should mean very little to most folks, but is one reason it doesn't support Google Daydream VR, which is a bummer in my book because I dig what Google is doing in that space.Todd Haselton | CNBCMotorola made a few other hardware improvements. There's a headphone jack on the bottom of this phone, which I still appreciate as an option. It also added new gesture support to the home button, which doubles as a fingerprint reader. You can swipe across it to move between apps or manage open windows, for example. It makes getting where you want to go a hair faster, but takes some getting used to.I really like Motorola's dedication to TurboCharging technology. The Moto Z2 Play can provide up to eight hours of usage after just a 15 minute charge, too, which is pretty incredible if you need a quick charge before leaving the office for a dinner meeting.Finally, Motorola improved the camera over last year's model with a better 12MP sensor. It's fast, which I liked, and seemed to take good pictures during my tests. I have no complaints on that front.Mods, mods and modsTodd Haselton | CNBCAll of this aside, the mods are what make the Moto Z2 Play the most compelling. I saw a few new ones that I can't talk about yet and a few that I can. Here's what's new.JBL, which Motorola told me made one of the more popular mods last year, is back with a new JBL SoundBoost 2 speaker mod. It slaps right on the back of the phone and, without any effort of changing of settings, will start playing music and movies much louder and clearer than what you'd get from the phone's speakers. It sounds great, like a portable Bluetooth speaker, and improved my TV-watching and movie-watching experiences. I also love the included kickstand, letting me prop the phone up on my coffee table and kick back.Todd Haselton | CNBCAnother mod, called the Moto Style Shell, offers a wood-grain texture and helps spice up the otherwise relatively boring look of the Moto Z2 Play. It also serves a purpose. Inside the $40 panel is support for wireless charging. Slap it on the back of the phone and, suddenly, the Moto Z2 Play can be dropped on any Qi or PMA (the two standards) charging pads and juice without any wires. This is the shell I used most of the time, since I keep a wireless charging pad right on my desk.Yet another mod, the Moto TurboPower Pack, is thin and light and provides another entire day of battery life. It supports TurboCharging, too, which means it can juice up your phone's battery to 50 percent in just 20 minutes. It's thin, but is generally meant to be removed from the device after the power has been transferred over to the phone. It was great in a bind when the phone died before I was set to film a video.Todd Haselton | CNBCFinally, there's a Moto GamePad that will launch this summer. I saw it but didn't have it available for review. It adds controls to the phone so that you can use it as a portable gaming system. It seems fun enough, but I prefer standalone options like a Nintendo Switch or even an iPad for my portable gaming.Final thoughtsTodd Haselton | CNBCYou're betting on Motorola's Mods if you pick up a Moto Z2 Play, since they're what make phone much more fun to use.Motorola has been working with partners and even Indiegogo to continue to create mods, and I'm glad to see it's an ecosystem the company is continuing to invest in. They're not for everyone, but for folks who want to add functions that weren't already available, they're the best way to do so. And, thanks to a new modular platform, Motorola says partners will soon be able to create even more affordable options.The Moto Z2 Play costs $499 and will be available this summer both unlocked (without a carrier contract) or exclusively on Verizon. That's $50 more than last year's model, but I think there's enough here \xe2\x80\x94 a thinner design, great battery life, an improved camera \xe2\x80\x94 that it's a great option for folks who don't want to spend the roughly $800 for a flagship such as the Galaxy S8 or iPhone 7, while also looking for something unique.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/moto-z2-play-review.html

""I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack.""However, Obama also said he is confident that ""our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got.""Here is the full statement: A year and a half ago, the world came together in Paris around the first-ever global agreement to set the world on a low-carbon course and protect the world we leave to our children.It was steady, principled American leadership on the world stage that made that achievement possible. It was bold American ambition that encouraged dozens of other nations to set their sights higher as well. And what made that leadership and ambition possible was America's private innovation and public investment in growing industries like wind and solar \xe2\x80\x93 industries that created some of the fastest new streams of good-paying jobs in recent years, and contributed to the longest streak of job creation in our history.Simply put, the private sector already chose a low-carbon future. And for the nations that committed themselves to that future, the Paris Agreement opened the floodgates for businesses, scientists, and engineers to unleash high-tech, low-carbon investment and innovation on an unprecedented scale.The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created. I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack. But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got.President Donald Trump said Thursday that the U.S. plans to withdraw from the landmark climate deal, and will initiate talks to forge a new agreement.At issue, Trump said, is striking a deal that will have terms that are ""fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers."" For example, the president cited targets for the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions that he believes are unrealistic.The U.S. technically cannot pull out of the Paris Agreement until November 2019, and the U.S. must give a year's notice before it can take steps to withdraw. This means the changes Trump proposes cannot take effect until 2020, although reports suggest there are ways to speed up the process. Proponents of U.S. participation in the agreement have argued that the commitment to reduce carbon pollution would spur new investments in ""green"" technologies, such as solar and wind power generation, energy efficiency and alternative transportation.

Economists surveyed by Reuters expected the report to show that private payrolls grew by 185,000 in May, from 174,000 in April.The ADP figures come ahead of the U.S. Labor Department's more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment. ""We are getting important data today and tomorrow, and gold is very much dependent on how the dollar and yields will react to that data, so it's a bit of a waiting game,"" said Georgette Boele, commodities strategist at ABN AMRO in AmsterdamSpot gold was down 0.15 percent at $1,266.20 per ounce. On Wednesday, it touched a session high of $1,273.74 an ounce, its strongest since April 25.APU.S. gold futures for August delivery fell$5.30 to $1,270.10 an ounce.Also weighing on gold was the slightly firmer dollar index, which extended gains after the ADP data, already supported by higher U.S. Treasury yields and solidifying expectations of a rise in U.S. interest rates this month.Positive payroll data from the United States could mean the Fed will raise rates as expected at its June 13-14 meeting.Traders believe there is an 87 percent chance of a rate rise, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.Gold, which has gained about 10 percent this year, has good support slightly below current levels, Boele said. ""Gold looks very well protected around the $1,250 area at the moment. You have the 200-day moving average supporting the price,"" she added.

414,Here\xe2\x80\x99s what happens if Trump leaves the Paris climate agreement,Politics,01-06-2017,"VIDEO2:4902:49Musk, Benioff urge Trump to remain in Paris climate deal Squawk on the StreetPresident Donald Trump said Wednesday he will announce whether the U.S. will withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change on Thursday.With White House sources indicating he's  leaning toward an exit, here's what you need to know about the international effort and what Trump's decision could mean for the environment.More from NBC News:Is new PAC Joe Biden's last act in politics or first step toward 2020?Women's equality party: Sophie Walker aims to oust Philip DaviesOhio sues Big Pharma, blaming drug makers for causing opioid epidemicWhat is the Paris agreement?The Paris Agreement is a deal reached between 195 countries to gradually reduce emissions that cause climate change in order to prevent a major increase in the global temperatures that could raise sea levels, spark major droughts, and lead to more dangerous storms.The agreement, which was negotiated in 2015 and took effect in November 2016, was spurred by the overwhelming global scientific consensus that rising global temperatures over the last several decades are caused by man-made activity. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which pools scientific research from around the world,  concluded that emissions caused were ""extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century"" with more than 95 percent confidence.Climate change is already impacting the planet, but the specific goal of the Paris Agreement is to prevent the planet from warming by more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), which scientists warn could have especially damaging consequences.What does the U.S. have to do?The agreement, which is not a binding treaty, calls on countries to make voluntary national pledges to reduce emissions and provide periodic updates on their progress.President Barack Obama committed America to a goal of lowering emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. These targets aren't fixed forever, though, and the broad aim is to increase them over time.The agreement also hinges on developed countries like the United States, whose economies have contributed more emissions historically, helping to finance developing countries' transition to cleaner forms of energy. The plan is to raise $100 billion a year through a mix of public and private sources.On the U.S. side, Obama  transferred $1 billion out of an initial $3 billion commitment to the United Nations Green Climate Fund before leaving office. But the recent spending deal in Congress, which funds the government through September, left out any contributions to the fund.Why would Trump want out?There are a number of aspects of the climate deal that run counter to the president's worldview.One, Trump does not accept the dominant scientific consensus on climate change and has a penchant for conspiracy theories that cast experts like researchers, doctors, or government agencies in the role of villain. He has repeatedly tweeted and said in campaign speeches that  climate change is a ""hoax"" and even suggested that China \xe2\x80\x94 another frequent Trump target \xe2\x80\x94 was behind the plot. Trump later said the accusation was a joke, but he has said he doesn't believe China will follow through on its promises to reduce their use of fossil fuels.Two, Trump is a skeptic of international agreements and institutions in general, which he often complains tie America down with obligations that don't provide enough concrete benefits in return. In addition to the Paris Agreement, Trump has rattled allies by criticizing trade agreements and military alliances.Three, Trump is not a fan of the regulations and spending that the previous administration proposed to meet its goals, which he warns will reduce economic growth. He appointed a prominent climate skeptic to run the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, and is rolling back the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, which was set to reduce power usage by coal plants in favor of cleaner forms of energy. Trump campaigned on reviving the coal industry and has expressed displeasure with some forms of renewable energy, especially wind.These objections aren't unique to Trump. Many conservatives opposed the Paris Agreement on similar grounds and have pushed him to withdraw.What happens if the US withdraws from the agreement?The agreement won't fall apart overnight. Already,  reports suggest China and the European Union are prepared to publicly recommit to the agreement with or without the United States. Some experts say China appears to be  reducing emissions ahead of schedule, in part because the country is phasing out coal quicker to reduce choking smog in its major cities.Trump also can't technically withdraw from the agreement until November 2019. It's possible he could speed things up by abandoning the underlying Senate-approved climate treaty that the agreement is linked to.It's an open question whether the United States will hit its Paris emissions target with or without the agreement. The economy is already moving away from carbon-heavy energy sources like coal in favor of cleaner natural gas and increasingly affordable renewable energy. Trump's actions  may not be enough to alter that trend. In addition, states like California have pledged to pick up the slack if Trump withdraws by instituting their own environmental restrictions.It's also notable that some of the largest companies in industries that would be impacted most by climate regulation are supporting the Paris Agreement. For example, ExxonMobil, the oil giant whose former CEO Rex Tillerson is now Secretary of State, has publicly lobbied the White House not to withdraw.""I actually think we might meet our target,"" J. Timmons Roberts, an environmental studies professor at Brown University, told NBC News. ""The technology is making the choices easier for people more quickly than expected.""But supporters of the agreement warn the United States would, at a minimum, damage its relationship with close allies by bolting and cede more global influence to rivals like China. In a worst-case scenario, the move would discourage developing nations from taking further steps to limit emissions, potentially hampering efforts to reduce emissions before dangerous temperature increases are locked in.A lot of this depends on expectations. If participating nations and industry leaders assume the United States exit is only a temporary bump and that future presidents will return to the table and pursue similar policies as Obama, that could also make them reluctant to make decisions based on Trump's decision alone.Watch: Musk says he'll leave WH councils if US leaves Paris Climate AgreementVIDEO1:3101:31Elon Musk: We'll depart White House councils if US leaves Paris AccordPower Lunch",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/heres-what-happens-if-trump-leaves-the-paris-climate-agreement.html

This week, China Labor Watch activist Hua Haifeng was arrested and accused of illegal surveillance after investigating alleged conditions of low pay and potential misuse of student interns at a Chinese company that produces Ivanka Trump-brand shoes.Around 250 rights lawyers and activists have been targeted in a crackdown by the Chinese government that started in July 2015, according to Amnesty International.VIDEO2:1902:19China's new cybersecurity law leaves companies with uncertaintyIn the run-up to President Donald Trump's April 7 meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, many wondered whether the unpredictable leader would stress the need for Beijing to embrace international human rights standards, having already upset the mainland on a myriad of other issues such as trade.Following the closely-watched summit, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a media briefing that human rights were ""embedded in every discussion"" and guided Trump's view on bilateral  economic, military and foreign policy cooperation.But as Trump strikes a conciliatory tone with Beijing to resolve the North Korea conflict following months of anti-China remarks, the White House has yet to strongly address the thorny issue.

420,Critics say Trump\xe2\x80\x99s cellphone diplomacy is dangerous. Experts aren't so sure.,Politics,01-06-2017,"Donald Trump talks on his phone.Carlo Allegri | ReutersThe Associated Press reported today that Donald Trump has been giving his cellphone number to the leaders of allied countries like Canada, Mexico, and France and telling them to call him directly.The Associated Press took a scolding tone, suggesting that the president is endangering national security by having sensitive conversations over a mobile device. Former Pentagon adviser Derek Chollet ominously told the AP: ""If you are speaking on an open line, then it's an open line, meaning those who have the ability to monitor those conversations are doing so.""But is talking to foreign leaders on a cellphone really such a security risk? Experts from Rice University and Security Research Labs told me it wasn't so obvious.More from Vox: Rolling back the birth control mandate is part of a much larger GOP strategyThe legal risks of Jared Kushner's meeting with a Russian banker, explainedThe GOP's ""Hillary Slayer"" will soon be in charge of investigating Trump in the HouseThe security of a smartphone depends on how it's configured and how it's used. And while Trump himself is hardly a security expert, the US government employs some of the world's most sophisticated security professionals. And they have likely taken elaborate precautions to maximize the security of the president's wireless communications.We don't know exactly what security precautions might have been taken, but one clue comes from a recent reports that Trump has swapped his ancient Android phone for an iPhone. According to Axios's Mike Allen, Trump's new iPhone  has just one third-party app: Twitter.It's probably an updated version of the  locked-down iPhone President Obama described last year. In an interview with Jimmy Fallon, the former president complained about the phone's limited functionality.""I imagine they locked down the phone in a variety of ways beyond removing apps,"" says Dan Wallach, a security expert at Rice University, by email.An obvious change, Wallach says, would be to replace the default phone app \xe2\x80\x94 which makes calls over the insecure conventional cell phone network \xe2\x80\x94 with an app that routes phone calls through an encrypted link to NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, MD.""That's a pretty good solution,"" says Karsten Nohl, a security expert at Security Research Labs who has done  groundbreaking research on the security of cellular networks. Indeed, he says, making calls using an encrypted smartphone app could be ""as safe as what you'd be using from a landline phone in the White House.""Of course, no communications system is perfect. Nohl says one big issue is that different countries have developed their own proprietary encrypted networks for internal communications. These systems aren't compatible with each other, so when world leaders call each other, they're sometimes forced to use unencrypted lines. But Nohl says countries face this challenge whether their leaders are making calls with a cellphone or a landline phone.It's also possible that despite the National Security Agency's precautions, foreign governments could hack into Trump's cellphone itself. But in that case, it wouldn't matter that much whether Trump took calls on his cellphone or via a nearby landline \xe2\x80\x94 so long as the smartphone was in the room, the hackers would be able to hear every word Trump said.Indeed, it's likely that when Trump makes calls using his cellphone, the biggest security threats come from things other than his own cellphone. For example, we can assume foreign intelligence agencies are trying to hack the personal cellphones of Trump's aides, family members, and others who spend time with the president. They may also try to plant listening devices in locations \xe2\x80\x94 like Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort \xe2\x80\x94 where Trump might have sensitive conversations. This is why presidents normally have sensitive conversations in  Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities \xe2\x80\x94 essentially high-tech tents that ensure no listening devices are within earshot.But there doesn't seem to be anything inherently insecure about a president taking calls from foreign leaders on a cellphone that has been suitably locked down by US intelligence agencies. Modern cryptography is extremely robust, and it allows cellphones to make calls that are essentially impervious to eavesdropping.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/critics-say-trumps-cellphone-diplomacy-is-dangerous-experts-arent-so-sure.html
421,Trump's plan to slash food stamp assistance could be a major setback for these retailers,Retail,02-06-2017,"A shopper loads purchases into his vehicle outside a Dollar General Corp. store in Princeton, Illinois.Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThough the border adjustment tax might be off the table, for now, some retailers should be paying close attention to the GOP's plans to change how the government allocates its dollars. Specifically, food assistance dollars. President Donald Trump's proposed budget is expected to slash $193 billion from the federal government's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, for the period 2018 to 2028.SNAP currently has an annual cost of around $70 billion. Should Trump's plan be approved by Congress, millions of Americans are sure to bear the brunt of the drastic changes, with the impact trickling down to one group of companies that's already been seen struggling of late: retailers. ""The probability of [Trump's budget] passing in its current form remains low, but it should be monitored, particularly for the discounters, grocers, and dollar stores \xe2\x80\x94 all of which have called out last year's big reduction as a drag on sales,"" Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom wrote in a recent note to clients.As of December 2016, the average SNAP household \xe2\x80\x94 there were roughly 43 million \xe2\x80\x94 was taking home about $252 per month in benefits, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.This amount would drop to $173 a month if Trump's budget is passed, representing a significant reduction of more than 31 percent, Grom went on, citing his firm's latest research on the subject. Trump's budget proposal, if passed, could significantly speed up what was already expected to be a gradual reduction in SNAP, from $65.8 billion in 2017 to $64.8 billion by 2026, according to a report from the CBO. After peaking in late 2012, the total number of SNAP participants has declined significantly, weighing on sales trends at a number of retailers as a result, Grom added. SNAP enrollment has been falling largely because some states have decided to end benefits even earlier than when they were required to. Where shoppers are using their SNAP dollarsThose retailers affected could include supercenters such as Wal-Mart and Target, dollar stores such as Dollar General and Family Dollar, and conventional grocers like Kroger, Grom said.""This is definitely a big concern,"" GlobalData Retail Managing Director Neil Saunders told CNBC in an interview. ""Anything that can damage [shoppers'] spending power can have a serious impact on the amount stores take in. ... [F]ood stamps do have a big effect on the amount they can spend and on the frequency of their trips to stores."" According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, supercenters have traditionally received the largest share of the food stamp program's redemptions.For example, 51.7 percent of SNAP dollars were redeemed at U.S. supercenters in 2016, while supermarkets received 30 percent of the program's currency, the group said. Meanwhile, a 2010 USDA study found that every $1 spent on SNAP generated another $1.79 for the economy. The study also called out specifically how food stamps can help support employment in the retail, wholesale and transportation industries. Recent SNAP changes hit 1Q earningsWith budget details yet to be hashed out, retailers aren't warning about the potential harm of future cuts. However, on recent earnings conference calls, they did discuss the hit they took from changes earlier this year.Gary Philbin, enterprise president of Family Dollar parent company Dollar Tree, said last week that the ""timing of sales through the first quarter was impacted by various factors including the material delays and the timing of tax refunds ... and cycling of the SNAP benefit rejections from 2016.""Philbin was referring to the more than 500,000 people cut off SNAP over the course of 2016, due to the return (in many states) of a three-month limit on SNAP benefits for unemployed adults ages 18 to 49, who aren't disabled or raising minor children.Dollar General also hit on this point during its earnings conference call Thursday. CEO Todd Vasos told analysts and investors: ""We continue to believe many of the headwinds we faced in 2016, and are continuing to face, are transitory in nature, such as ... customer behavior that we believe to be associated with changes to the federal SNAP benefit program.""The reduction of SNAP benefits continued to weigh on Dollar General's same-store sales results for the latest quarter, Vasos added.Forty-three percent of dollar-store shoppers made an annual household income of $29,000 or less, according to Nielsen data, illustrating just how much stores like Dollar Tree, Family Dollar and Dollar General depend on lower-income, SNAP recipients, for sales.As of December 2016, there were more than 29,000 dollar stores open in the U.S., representing a 35 percent increase from a decade ago, Nielsen said.Meanwhile, the gradual rollout of changes to SNAP in 2016 is estimated to have weighed about 0.4 to 0.6 percent on Wal-Mart's same-store sales, according to Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners. ""It's not insignificant,"" Johnson had said. ""People are very stretched financially ... this is yet another pressure factor."" The alterations to SNAP qualifications in 2016 had a smaller impact than when a separate benefit increase ended in late 2013, he added. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the implementations in 2013 reduced the benefits of ""nearly every SNAP recipient"" \xe2\x80\x94 roughly 47 million people \xe2\x80\x94 who on average saw their benefit cut by 7 percent. During the first quarter of 2014, Wal-Mart said these particular changes trimmed its grocery sales by 0.9 percent. Obviously, there are still many caveats to how Trump's latest government budget proposal will pan out and ultimately impact retailers, Gordon Haskett's Grom told CNBC in an interview. Though, overall \xe2\x80\x94 food stamps noise aside \xe2\x80\x94 ""retailers should be doing better in general,"" he added, ""if we're seeing this growth in the economy.""Grom said he hopes retailers don't begin to ""cast blame"" again \xe2\x80\x94 masking poor earnings results \xe2\x80\x94 on fewer families using food stamps at their stores.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/trumps-plan-to-slash-food-stamp-assistance-could-hurt-retailers.html
422,"China's tallest skyscraper is facing rental woes, reflecting wider issues in the market",Real Estate,02-06-2017,"VIDEO2:5602:56China's tallest building is facing problemsStreet Signs AsiaSHANGHAI, China \xe2\x80\x94 Noisy, grinding machinery and traffic snarled around dusty construction sites. These are common sights and sounds in China, as the world's second-largest economy builds rapidly into the sky.China has constructed more skyscrapers than any other country every year for nearly a decade, according to the Council of Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. And the most iconic edifice in these transformed skylines is Shanghai Tower, a shiny column that spirals 128 floors and 632 meters into the clouds, making it China's tallest building, and the world's second-highest.It's got plenty of bells and whistles, boasts the world's fastest elevators, a stunning observatory deck, and even notched top marks for green building by industry groups in the U.S. and China.But Shanghai Tower reflects wider woes in China's commercial property market, as it has struggled to attract tenants since the last beam was placed on top three years ago. Experts say the challenge is that companies looking to cut costs amid a wider growth slowdown are now spoiled for choice.""With more and more skyscrapers in Shanghai, in cities [in China], the vacancy will remain very high for some time,"" said Anny Zhang, head of Shanghai office leasing for Jones Lang LaSalle, one of the agents for Shanghai Tower.The vacancy rates for prime office space in Shanghai spiked to 12 percent in the first quarter, according to JLL. And troubles in top tier cities, which attract a wide range of companies, could be compounded in smaller cities.Entire floors of Shanghai Tower continue to sit empty, contributing to city vacancies. Part of the issue was due to a delay in obtaining fire safety permits, which only came through a few months ago. But a planned luxury hotel has yet to open and hallways remain deserted.An aerial view of Shanghai Tower, lit with the words ""Olympic Games"" in Chinese, on August 6, 2016 in Shanghai, China.Zhang Suoqing | VCG | Getty Images About 60 percent of the office space has now been leased out, but only one-third of those tenants have moved in, said JLL. Major tenants include Alibaba and All Bright Law Firm, according to CBRE, the other leasing agent for Shanghai Tower.Still, ""it is an iconic building,"" said Andrew Nicholson, head of asset services in Asia Pacific for CBRE.""When you land at Pudong Airport \xe2\x80\xa6 you see Shanghai Tower rising out,"" he said. ""Like any building, you seek not to market just the office space \xe2\x80\x94 you market a community, you market an environment.""And that's exactly what attracted All Bright Law Firm, said Chen Guang, a senior lawyer at the firm.""The building is unique in China, and it suits our firm's image, as we are a leader in the legal profession,"" Chen said. ""This is also what the Shanghai Justice Bureau hopes \xe2\x80\x94 for a signature Shanghai law firm to enter Shanghai Tower.""Despite the issues that China's tallest building has faced, both JLL and CBRE say they remain confident that the market will pick up in the long run.For instance, there are government programs and policies that will continue to draw companies to certain areas, like free trade or special economic zones, as they have to be there to take advantage of tax breaks or special programs.Demand is also coming from smaller companies looking to upgrade to better space, Zhang said.

""It's like anti-Semitism,"" he said, comparing Russia's critics to people who would say things like ""the Jews are to blame.""Through a live translation in the televised interview with NBC News' Megyn Kelly, Putin alleged that U.S. spies have ""no specific evidence, no facts, just assumptions and allegations"" to back their conclusion that the Kremlin attempted to assist Donald Trump in the election.Pressed about the evidence, Putin argued that IP addresses could be manufactured and quipped that a 3-year-old could have hacked U.S. institutions. Russian President Vladimir Putin speaking June 2, 2017.Sergei Savostyanov | TASS | Host Photo Agency | Pool | ReutersThe FBI, CIA and NSA concluded in a January report that Putin's regime used hackers, Kremlin agencies and paid online ""trolls"" to undermine the U.S. election and help Trump win.

Putin contended that there were ""no agreements whatsoever"" to lift sanctions. In its final days, the Obama administration imposed additional sanctions on Moscow in response to accusations by U.S. intelligence agencies and others that Russian had tried to subvert the election.The U.S. and European countries already had sanctions in place against Russia for pressing a war in Ukraine and then annexing the Ukrainian province of Crimea.

Factory orders dataOn Monday, the Commerce Department publishes factory orders data for the month of April shortly after the opening bell, and Sanchez is watching to see if the economic indicator's figures will show growth.""Manufacturing and construction have been showing some signs of slowing. April manufacturing slipped, lowering their overall year-end growth numbers,"" she said Friday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation,"" adding that a continuation of this trend could spell trouble for copper, which has a variety of uses in manufacturing.Factory orders in March, the last month recorded, increased for the fourth straight month and showed growth of 5.2 percent year over year.2. Jobless claimsThe Department of Labor publishes its weekly jobless claims on Thursday. Sanchez is watching closely to see how the data pans out, after Friday's employment report showed unemployment fell but fewer jobs were created last month than economists had expected.""We've lately seen a trend of slightly higher jobless claims,"" Sanchez said Friday. ""However, labor markets remain tight and Americans are spending more, factories have increased outputs and home sales are strong. This is consistent with the beginning of a recovery.""This week's jobless claims came in higher than expected.Another measure of labor market health is anticipated next week: The Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to publish its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey on Tuesday, which broadly measures job openings in the U.S.3. Mortgage applicationsThe Mortgage Bankers Association publishes its weekly Mortgage Applications Survey on Wednesday, and Sanchez is watching to see whether applications pick up.""Mortgage rates have been higher than they were a year ago. However, they have been falling recently along with the long end of the retail curve,"" she said Friday.Indeed, mortgage application volume is still nearly 14 percent below levels seen one year ago, although they did rise last month by 2 percent.""30-year fixed mortgages dropped below 4 percent, and this should be good for mortgage applications,"" she said, adding that such positive activity would bode well for homebuilders like the ITB, the popular exchange-traded fund tracking homebuilder stocks.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/housing-and-manufacturing-data-heres-what-could-drive-the-markets-next-week.html
425,"After bomb threats, FCC proposes letting police unveil anonymous callers",Tech,02-06-2017,"David De Lossy | Photodisc | Getty ImagesPolice should be allowed to unmask anonymous callers who have made serious threats over the phone, the Federal Communications Commission  has proposed.The proposal would allow law enforcement, and potentially the person who's been called, to learn the phone number of an anonymous caller if they receive a ""serious and imminent"" threat that poses ""substantial risk to property, life, safety, or health.""Specifics are still up in the air. The FCC is asking, for instance, whether unveiled caller ID information should only be provided to law enforcement officials investigating a threat, to ensure that this exemption isn't abused.The proposal is meant to solve a problem that popped up earlier this year when Jewish Community Centers across the country  received a series of anonymous bomb threats that went on for weeks. The FCC granted  a temporary exemption to law enforcement at the time, allowing investigators to find out the numbers these anonymous calls came fromBut that waiver only applied to the JCC threats. With this proposal, the commission is now hoping to extend it to many future threats that are made over the phone.At the same time, the commission is also considering another exception to the rules: it might allow private emergency services, like an ambulance company, to unmask anonymous calls so that they can provide help. A similar exemption already exists for public emergency services.The proposal is still in its early stages. An initial vote will come later this month, after which there'll be several months for the public to weigh in with comments. The FCC will then finalize its proposal based on that feedback and vote again to enact the rules.FCC proposals always start out as a series of questions, and in this case, it has quite a few to answer. The commission will have to strike a balance between ensuring the privacy of legitimate anonymous callers and ensuring that law enforcement can access the phone numbers of people who truly are delivering threats.""Threatening callers do not have a legitimate privacy interest in having blocked caller ID protected from disclosure,"" the commission writes. It also notes that this proposal must recognize ""the privacy interests of legitimate callers who may have valid reasons to block their telephone numbers.""While being able to uncover the number behind an anonymous call will certainly be a help for law enforcement, it won't entirely solve the problem of masked callers. Hackers have been able  to hijack phone systems and use those to place calls, meaning the phone number wouldn't actually link back to them.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/after-bomb-threats-fcc-proposes-letting-police-unveil-anonymous-callers.html

The United Nations Green Climate Fund counts as part of that pledge, but the overall picture is more complicated.As Trump mentioned later in his speech, the United States has given the Green Climate Fund $1 billion already. President Barack Obama pledged a total of $3 billion to the fund by 2020 as part of a global goal of $10 billion, but Trump promised not to finance it as a candidate and Congress has not made further contributions since the election.Trump described this amount as ""costing the United States a vast fortune,"" but it's a minuscule portion of the budget, where total federal spending in the 2016 fiscal year was  $3.9 trillion. For perspective, the White House's recent budget proposal contained  an apparent $2 trillion accounting error \xe2\x80\x94 a number 1,000 times as large as the remaining $2 billion commitment to the fund.There are multiple arguments for this funding. One is a matter of fairness: The largest polluters by far have been developed nations like the United States. Another is a matter of effectiveness: Fast-growing countries like India are building the next generation of power plants and the Paris Agreement won't work unless they decide to forgo dirtier forms of energy like coal. The goal of the funding is to help nudge developing countries towards cleaner energy like wind and solar instead.If the funding succeeds in lowering emissions and preventing a major temperature increase, the United States reaps the economic benefits as well. And by helping countries that are especially vulnerable prepare for the effects of climate change, they could prevent or minimize future refugee crises that could destabilize regions and spill over into the developed world.The other number Trump mentioned was goal of eventually mobilizing $100 billion per year to help poorer countries combat climate change, which was first announced in 2009 at the Copenhagen climate conference.J. Timmons Roberts, a researcher at the Brookings Institution who tracks climate spending, described the commitment as more complex and often indirect than aid through programs like the Green Climate Fund.In addition to being spread out around the developed world, the $100 billion goal is much more vague. The number includes not only foreign aid, but private sector investments as well, and there's a lot of wiggle room over what counts towards the total.An Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development analysis in 2016, for example, predicted pledges worldwide would add  up to $67 billion per year by 2020 \xe2\x80\x94 a major step towards the target. But countries like India have complained similar estimates have been  massively inflated by items like private loans to buy green technology from developed nations that are closer to ordinary business transactions than foreign aid.Roberts said there's some merit to their complaints: He examined $10 billion of pledged 2012 aid with the think tank consortium Adaptation Watch, for example, and concluded  only about $2.3 billion could be clearly verified as such.In a possible gesture to these funding issues, Trump indicated that the $100 billion goal could increase significantly.No matter how it's calculated, though, the Paris Agreement is not a binding treaty and the United States is not legally obligated to provide any specific amount. That means Trump would have been free to remain in the agreement without spending another dollar as president.WATCH: Vladimir Putin responds to Trump's decision to leave Paris climate accordVIDEO1:3601:36Vladimir Putin responds to Trump's decision to leave Paris climate accordSquawk Box",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/why-trump-is-seeing-red-about-the-green-climate-fund.html

432,Pennsylvania insurers' rate hikes would quadruple under Trump health-care reform,Health and Science,02-06-2017,"muratkoc | Getty ImagesPennsylvania health insurers are asking for prices of their Obamacare plans to rise by an average of less than 9 percent in 2018 \xe2\x80\x94 but also warn rate increases could be more than quadruple that if President Donald Trump guts two key parts of the Affordable Care Act.The requested rate hikes in the Keystone State are much lower than those being sought in several other states. The steep price increases requested elsewhere reflect projected fallout from potential actions by the Trump administration and Congress.However, Pennsylvania's insurers were asked to price their Obamacare plans next year \xe2\x80\x94 at least for now \xe2\x80\x94 at levels that assume those actions won't happen.The five insurers that sell individual health plans in Pennsylvania have asked Insurance Commissioner Teresa Miller to raise aggregate prices of those plans by 8.8 percent, according to Miller, who also noted that no insurer plans to leave the Obamacare market.That rate is sharply lower than the average rate hike of 32.5 percent that Miller signed off on for this year in an effort to avoid big financial losses by health plans.But Miller also said that if Congress, at the behest of Trump, repeals the Obamacare rule requiring most Americans to have some form of health insurance or pay a fine, insurers would seek a rate increase of 23.3 percent statewide next year.The Republican bill known as the American Health Care Act, which is pending in Congress, seeks to repeal that so-called individual mandate.And if the Trump administration stops reimbursing insurers for a critical Obamacare subsidy to low-income customers, insurers would ask for rate hikes of 20.3 percent, Miller said.But ""if both changes occurred, insurers estimate they would seek an increase of 36.3 percent,"" according to a statement released by Miller's office.VIDEO4:2604:26Sen. Franken: House health-care plan is 'terrible'Squawk BoxTrump has both called for a repeal of Obamacare's individual mandate, and has threatened to cut off the reimbursements to insurers.The reimbursements, known as cost-sharing reductions, are for discounts in the out-of-pocket health costs charged to low-income Obamacare customers by their insurance plans.More than half of Obamamcare customers nationally get those discounts. Insurers expect to be paid about $7 billion in reimbursements for them by the federal government this year. Their fate has been called into question both by a court challenge to them by the Republican-led House of Representatives and by Trump's hostility toward the Affordable Care Act. The GOP's bill would formally kill the cost-sharing reductions.A spokeswoman for Miller told CNBC that insurers would be able to resubmit their rate requests later this year if either the mandate was repealed or if the CSR reimbursements ceased.""Information provided by insurers shows the extent to which instability and changes would impact Pennsylvania's 2018 health insurance rates,"" said Miller, whose state's residents buy Obamacare plans on HealthCare.gov and outside of that federal insurance exchange.""This proves what we already know \xe2\x80\x94 instability caused by adverse action from the federal government will do nothing but hurt consumers who are stuck in the middle,"" said Miller.""The 506,000 Pennsylvanians with Affordable Care Act-compliant plans in the individual market deserve single-digit rate increases like the ones most people will see if Congress and the Trump administration choose not to risk consumers' health and financial well-being by jeopardizing the stability of these markets,"" she said.Independence Blue Cross, the market leader for Obamacare plans in the Philadelphia area, told CNBC that its rate submissions reflected guidance from Miller's Insurance Department, and relied ""on state and federal regulations as they stand today.""But, ""Given the legislative and regulatory uncertainty around health care reform, it may be necessary to reevaluate our proposed rates before they are finalized,"" said Independence Blue Cross CEO Daniel Hilferty.""As such, it is critical that the federal government commit to funding cost-sharing reductions to avoid disruption in the market and to ensure those with low and moderate incomes get the care they need,"" Hilferty said. The other insurers selling plans in Pennsylvania are Capital Blue Cross, Geisinger Health Plan, Highmark and UPMC Health Plan.Last week, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina, that state's largest Obamacare insurer, said it wanted to hike premiums in 2018 by an average of 22.9 percent. The insurer said that most of that price increase reflected the failure of Trump and congressional Republicans to guarantee continued reimbursements to insurers for the cost-sharing reductions.Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina said it would have asked for average rate increases of just 8.8 percent if those payments were guaranteed. That is the same average rate being sought by Pennsylvania insurers, who have assumed the payments would continue.In other states, including Maryland, Connecticut, Oregon, Virginia, as well as in the District of Columbia, insurers also have asked for double-digit percentage price hikes, and pointed to uncertainty about the cost-sharing reduction payments as a key factor in those premium requests. CareFirst Blue Cross Blue Shield has asked for rate increases of more than 50 percent in Maryland, 35 percent in parts of Virginia and 29 percent in Washington, D.C., according to The Washington Post.Andy Slavitt, former head of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has estimated that uncertainty over the cost-sharing reduction reimbursements could, by itself, add almost 20 percent to the price of Obamacare plans next year.Kevin Counihan, former CEO of HealthCare.gov, said the relatively low rate increases sought by Pennsylvania insurers ""underscores the impact of engaged issuers and regulators in stabilizing the ACA marketplace.""""It also shows the risk of continued ambiguity around CSR funding and individual mandate enforcement,"" Counihan said.""All new and broad social programs, particularly market-based ones, require time to adjust. The results from Pennsylvania are the most recent example of engagement and patience.""Watch: Ryan says health care bill won't force young families to overpay for careVIDEO1:3101:31Ryan: Bill won't force young families to overpay for carePower Lunch",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/pennsylvania-insurers-ask-obamacare-rate-rise-of-less-than-9-percent.html

The unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent from 4.4 percent, viewed as a negative since the number of people participating in the workforce also declined.Stock futures gave back gains after the report but reversed losses after opening lower and rose to new highs. Economists had expected job growth of 185,000, and some had raised their forecasts Thursday after ADP reported 253,000 private sector payrolls were added in May. Bond yields fell to their lows of the year, with the  yield at 2.15 percent. Yields move lower when prices move higher.""While the Fed still struggles to go in June, the one big takeaway from this report is that a September rate hike is largely off the table. September was always going to be a struggle because of its proximity to the debt ceiling debate,"" said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets.There were also major revisions to March and April payrolls, with a total of 66,000 fewer jobs reported for those months, taking the three-month average to just 121,000.""It is weaker than the rate we had in 2016, and certainly the first three months of this year. There is a notable shift there. The last three months average of 121,000 ... I think they'd have to go back a while to find a trailing three months that weak,"" said Ron Sanchez, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust.VIDEO0:3500:35Stocks hit all-time highs todayDigital Original""It begs the question, is this a reflection of tightness in the labor market, a natural decline? ... Is this a sign of a slower economy, or tightening labor market?"" said Sanchez. He pointed to the steady declines in the unemployment rate, down 0.5 percentage point this year, and the drop to a 2007 low of 8.4 percent in the U6 rate, reflecting the longer-term unemployed. Sanchez said that would argue that the labor market is reflecting signs of tightness, meaning employers are having a hard time finding employees to hire.But the lack of traction in wage growth is a concern.""It still remains a mystery about why it's not transferring to wages. The Fed can view this as a maybe tightening labor market but one that is not so tight it creates inflation pressure,"" he said. That would argue for patience on the part of the Fed, he added. ""The markets haven't changed their view that the Fed is on a near-term path. It's still 90 percent for June in two weeks. The question is longer than that. There's seems questions about whether they move in September. It might be moved out to December, but it's too early,"" said Sanchez. The Fed has forecast two more rate increases for this year, after its March hike, and it has also spelled out how it may begin to shrink its balance sheet late in the year. ""We have a debt ceiling showdown. We have uncertainty around policy. I was not waiting for a September hike anyway. There could still be three rate hikes this year but the Fed needs to see a lot more wage acceleration,"" said Diane Swonk, CEO of DS Economics.Employment and inflation are dual mandates of the Fed. While labor data have been solid, the central bank has watched core inflation slip away from its 2 percent target to 1.5 percent, as measured by the PCE deflator.""This is enough of a gain for the Fed, given how their threshold is 100,000 or less, but it's going to be a tough one for the Fed and [rate-hiking path] going forward,"" said Swonk. ""The average since the beginning of the year is 181,000. It still is strong enough for a third rate hike.""Swonk said the lack of wage growth is a puzzle. ""They're not paying out as much,  as they say they have shortages. The increase in wages in the manufacturing sector are not reflecting the fact they have shortages,"" she said.  ""We're hearing a lot of complaints about the shortages. It's not being matched by wage acceleration,"" she said, adding that there has been hope the job market would begin to look more like the economy of the 1990s. ""The missing aspect is productivity growth. These are not skilled workers. Are firms going to bid for workers? Right now, it looks like they're protecting their margins. We're still waiting.

On Wednesday, Reuters reported there were deal talks between the two, which sent Pinnacle shares soaring.Representatives from Conagra and Pinnacle declined to speak on speculation. This isn't the first food-and-beverage deal to go bust in recent months, either. Earlier this year, for example, Unilever rejected Kraft Heinz's merger pursuit.Additionally, packaged food companies like Conagra and Pinnacle have been under increasing pressure by grocers, including big-box players such as Wal-Mart, to keep prices low for budget-conscious consumers. This has made for a tough time in the packaged goods space, as shoppers are also seeking healthier, fresher foods in stores, and are buying fewer processed goods from the center of the store and the frozen food aisle. Chicago, Illinois-based Conagra has been trying to reinvent itself since it sold its private-label unit for $2.7 billion in 2016, in what was seen as an attempt to focus on its branded food business.Pinnacle shares were falling a little more than 7 percent Friday morning on news that the deal with Conagra wouldn't go through. Meanwhile, shares of Conagra were falling around 2.3 percent, and the stock is down a little more than 5 percent over the past 3 months. Pinnacle's stock has seen gains of a little more than 5 percent for the three-month period. \xe2\x80\x94CNBC's Lauren Thomas contributed to this report.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/conagra-pinnacle-foods-deal-talks-have-ended-sources.html

""I spoke with President Trump on Tuesday and tried to persuade him to keep the U.S. in the agreement. But it wasn't enough,"" Cook wrote. He added in the email that climate change was real and that everyone had a shared responsibility to fight it. He assured employees that Thursday's decision will not affect Apple's commitments to protect the environment. ""We power nearly all of our operations with renewable energy, which we believe is an example of something that's good for our planet and makes good business sense as well.""

Disney CEO Robert Iger also said he quit the White House's business advisory council over the decision. Goldman Sachs CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, also criticized the decision on Twitter.After pulling the U.S. out from the climate agreement, Trump said he would start talks to re-enter the accord with what he called a more ""fair"" deal, but the president was immediately rebuked by several European governments. Here's the full excerpt of Cook's email. Team,I know many of you share my disappointment with the White House's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. I spoke with President Trump on Tuesday and tried to persuade him to keep the U.S. in the agreement. But it wasn't enough.Climate change is real and we all share a responsibility to fight it. I want to reassure you that today's developments will have no impact on Apple's efforts to protect the environment. We power nearly all of our operations with renewable energy, which we believe is an example of something that's good for our planet and makes good business sense as well.We will keep working toward the ambitious goals of a closed-loop supply chain, and to eventually stop mining new materials altogether. Of course, we're going to keep working with our suppliers to help them do more to power their businesses with clean energy. And we will keep challenging ourselves to do even more. Knowing the good work that we and countless others around the world are doing, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about our planet's future.Our mission has always been to leave the world better than we found it.

""Yep, corporate earnings have been so positive in 2017 that investors are reluctant to sell because from an asset class perspective, stocks are pretty much the only decent game in town, unless you think that 10-year Treasurys yielding 2 percent are a good place to put some money.""Stocks hardly shook when President Donald Trump announced the United States would pull out of the Paris Agreement, Cramer added.""The stock market charges ever upward, oblivious of Washington, even as I now worry about an upcoming fight over the debt ceiling,"" he said.With the market's unfaltering attitude in mind, here are the stocks and events Cramer will be watching next week:Monday: Thor IndustriesThe world's largest recreational vehicle manufacturer in the country will report earnings on Monday, and Cramer has been very right and very wrong on the stock's movements.Before Thor reported its last quarter, the ""Mad Money"" host did not advise investors to sell, assuming that the company would not deliver a bad quarter.But its stock fell nearly 10 percent after the report as the market's worries about Thor's shrinking profit margins manifested, bringing shares down to 5 percent for the year as of Friday.""I'm tempted to believe that Thor has course corrected, but you know what? Here on 'Mad Money,' it's kind of like the NHL. We put companies in the penalty box ... so I'm adopting a wait-and-see approach for Thor,"" Cramer said.Tuesday: HD Supply Holdings, Dave & Buster'sHD Supply Holdings: If you are looking for a company that gives you a good read on the economy, Cramer says to look no further than this industrial distributor, which provides an array of products to 500,000 customers in construction, maintenance, and water infrastructure.""Last quarter, the read-through was sub-optimal and the stock got hammered. Plus, HD Supply's commentary caused many a well researched bull ... [to] correctly ratchet back their economic growth expectations, especially for small and medium sized businesses after listening to this company's conference call. Soon after, though, Jana Partners, the activist hedge fund, said it liked HDS and thought the stock, which is at $41, could go to $60 on a sale. Hey, let's see if they comment on that,"" Cramer said, referencing the company's Tuesday earnings report.Dave & Buster's: Cramer expects terrific earnings from the restaurant and entertainment center company when it reports after the bell. The ""Mad Money"" host expects Dave & Buster's, a staple to the experiential economy, to announce expansion plans as well.Wednesday: Brown-FormanIn most cases, Cramer would not focus on earnings from the wine and spirits giant behind Jack Daniels whiskey, but chatter of Constellation Brands eyeing Brown-Forman as a takeover target caught his eye.""I think that would be very out of character for Constellation. It's been growing by picking off high-end boutique brands, then exploiting [them] through its fabulous distribution network to blow away the numbers,"" Cramer said. ""That said, where there's smoke, I don't know, maybe there's a little fire, if not a conflagration, as this is a family-run two-classes-of-stock business, meaning even if Constellation was interested in buying, it would have to be Brown-Forman wanting to sell. Still, it will be a closely listened to conference call because of that rumor.""Thursday: The J.M. Smucker Company, Vail ResortsJ.M. Smucker: This manufacturer of jams, peanut butter and pet food will report earnings, and the ""Mad Money"" host is watching for an upturn after several disappointing quarters.""It seems that there's been endless price wars in their aisles in the supermarket and it's crimped their earnings power,"" Cramer said, adding that Smucker's new organic products could improve its prospects. ""Is that the case now? Tough to tell, but I don't think long-term holders will be hurt if they pick some up after the quarter.""Vail Resorts: The ski resort operator will report earnings before the bell, and Cramer blessed it as a trade.""This has been a terrific story for some time,"" he said. ""Vacations have become Facebook rites of passage and Vail's been benefiting from this trend for ages.""Friday: Federal Reserve anticipation, Baker Hughes rig countFed: Cramer says a selloff is possible ahead of Fed meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday of the following week if the market gets worked up over this Friday's lagging jobs report.""Remember, most investors and all holders of bank stocks, for heaven's sake, which have been horrendous, want to see the Fed raise rates as a sign of economic health. We're in the odd position of worrying that the Fed might not tighten after this weaker [labor] report that we got this morning. If they do nothing, there will be selling, so why not get out ahead?"" Cramer said.Baker Hughes: The ""Mad Money"" host advised investors to keep an eye on the weekly rig count from this oil field service company.""Crude's come under pressure any time we get a big jump in rigs,"" he said. ""Why does it matter so much? Because each rig can produce a ton of oil and whatever OPEC tries to keep off the market has been more than made up by our own oil companies in shales like the Permian in Texas, SCOOP and STACK in Oklahoma and the Bakken in North Dakota.""So as the stream of earnings reports gets thinner each week, Cramer finds the market laser-focused on how businesses are doing, looking for telltale signs of how the economy is faring.""The earnings have counteracted all sorts of economic weakness and allowed stocks to continue their remarkable 2017 run,"" he said.

441,Three big events could bring some volatility back into markets,Market Insider,02-06-2017,"Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.Getty ImagesThe record high stock market may be signaling it's the best of times. But the bond market looks to be saying just the opposite: If it's not the worst of times, it soon could be.Traders have been debating which one is right \xe2\x80\x94 the stock market grinding to new highs, or bonds, with yields at post-Election Day lows.Stocks have been guided by solid earnings and still some hope that there could be stimulus coming from Washington, but Treasury yields, which move opposite price, are trading lower amid concerns the lack of inflation and sluggish economy could be a problem if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates too much.The great divide between markets should remain a theme in the coming week, but there are several events that create the opportunity for volatility across financial markets \xe2\x80\x94 and all of them occur on Thursday.Former FBI director James Comey is scheduled to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee at 10 a.m. Thursday, and markets are braced in the event he says President Donald Trump tried to end Comey's investigation into former national security advisor Michael Flynn.Then there's the European Central Bank meeting, which has been surrounded by a swirl of speculation that the central bank could signal a pending end to some of its easy policy. That could move the euro, bond yields and stocks if the ECB signals it is getting set to pull back, though analysts do not expect anything abrupt.There's also the U.K. election, called by Prime Minister Theresa May in the hopes it would show a mandate for Brexit.""Fear of a European election, and noise coming out of Washington getting louder \xe2\x80\x94 when you look at things that have caused us to take a significant pause in 2017, two of those things could happen next week,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities.The U.K. election was expected to go smoothly, but the Labour Party has been making gains in the polls. It's not clear May will get the majority she expected, casting doubt on how smoothly the U.K.'s negotiations to unwind from the European Union will go.""I think this is just one episode in the drama between the euro zone and the U.K. that's going to be playing out and markets have to focus on the longer term. Who has the stronger hand and who gets what?"" said Steven Wieting, Citi Private Bank chief global strategist.Trading placesStocks ended the week with the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 all at record highs. Technicians are looking to see if the Russell 2000 confirms the trend. It was up 1.7 percent for the week. The S&P 500 closed at 2,439, up 0.4 percent. Meanwhile, bond yields fell, and the 10-year was at a low of 2.15 Friday.Analysts said the low yields in the bond market were also serving as a catalyst for stocks. ""It's earnings and the constant rotation. The yield on the 10-year is so low, the dividend darlings are back in vogue. It's consumer staples. It's REITs. It's utilities, and it's telcos,"" said Hogan. The S&P utility sector rose 1.7 percent for the week, to an all-time high. The health-care sector rose 2 percent for the week, and telecommunications stocks were up 2.3 percent. ""I just don't think we can use the yield of the 10-year as a barometer for the economy,"" said Hogan. He said it is a safety play, but it also points to the lack of inflation. ""We have reason to think we need harbors of safety right now.""With bond yields plumbing new lows, the trade in the coming week could focus on technicals and big round numbers.""I think it's going to be largely a technical trade,"" said Ian Lyngen, Treasury strategist at BMO. ""I think we come in Monday morning and the market tries to re-trade the jobs data ... what the data means and what it implies for monetary policy. I think there will be an opportunity for more volatility early in the week, and then we'll be back to more of the same ... a holding pattern, limited new information and watching the corporate deal flow."" Drama in D.C.The testimony of James Comey has been a much-anticipated event, and the very idea that Trump could be ensnared in some obstruction of the investigation rattled markets when news reports said Comey had said Trump interfered.""If it looks like he wasn't involved, the market's fine, and we move on, but if it clearly feels it's a crossed line and could make a significant case and we are talking about obstruction of justice again, that's certainly going to give the market problems,"" said Hogan.Jim Caron, Morgan Stanley Investment Management fixed income portfolio manager, does not expect to see anything material come of the testimony.""I personally don't think anything comes out of it. I think it becomes a partisan debate, but the market needs to see a resolution of that,"" Caron said. ""This is an event we're all going to be watching. It's certainly going to take a lot of attention. The good news is once it's over, it's over.""European bankersThe ECB is at most expected to make minor tweaks to the language in its post-meeting statement Thursday, but markets are on high alert because of the recent runup in the euro, up 0.9 percent in the past week, a seven-month high. ""Everybody I talk to expects there will be some tweaking of the forward guidance, which has two components,"" said Marc Chandler, head of foreign exchange strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman. ""One component of the forward guidance talks about how interest rates will remain at this level or lower. They could drop that 'or lower.' ""But the markets already know that European rates have bottomed. This is going to confirm what the market already knows,"" said Chandler.

443,Trump allies push new Fannie and Freddie reform plan,US Economy,02-06-2017,"Two powerful investment groups with ties to the White House are pitching a new plan that would free the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from US government control \xe2\x80\x94 and restore value to their investment in the companies.Blackstone, the world's biggest private equity group, and the hedge fund Paulson & Co have hired the investment bank Moelis to develop proposals to overhaul the two agencies.A Freddie Mac sign stands outside the company's headquarters in McLean, Virginia, U.S., on Tuesday, April 8, 2014Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty Images Together, Fannie and Freddie guarantee the bulk of US home loans and underpin the country's unique system of 30-year fixed rate mortgages.Moelis published what it described as a detailed blueprint for reform on Thursday, pitching itself into the heated debate over the future of the agencies. A leading banking lobby immediately attacked the proposals as ""self-serving"", and it remained far from clear that the plans would gain traction in Washington, despite the political connections of its proponents. More from the Financial Times:  Macron's UK fundraiser stays put in London, so far  Macquarie Group reportedly mulling offshore move to avoid bank tax   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac: dreaming spirals  Paulson, whose manager John Paulson was an economic policy adviser to Donald Trump's election campaign, and Blackstone, whose chairman and chief executive Stephen Schwarzman heads the president's strategic and policy forum, own preference shares in the two agencies.Fannie and Freddie have been in a limbo state of ""conservatorship"" \xe2\x80\x94 meaning they are neither fully public nor private \xe2\x80\x94 since the government rescued them at the height of the 2008 financial crisis.VIDEO5:2005:20Mnuchin: We need to fix Fannie and FreddieSquawk on the StreetUnder the present financial structure, they pay all of their profits to the Treasury in the form a dividend, to compensate taxpayers for the risk they bear in providing a financial backstop.Investors who own the shares claim the post-crisis set-up is unfair and untenable. Several have taken legal action against the Treasury.Moelis claimed its recapitalisation plan would allow the government to realise between $75bn and $100bn in cash by exercising warrants, a structure it likened to the post-crisis resolution of the bailed-out insurer AIG.Private investors would plough additional funds into the two groups as part of the proposed recapitalisation. With up to $180bn of new capital, there ""should not be a realistic scenario"" in which the government would be on the hook for losses even in a future financial crisis, Moelis claims. The government would nonetheless be paid a fee for providing a backstop against losses beyond that figure.Details of the plan appear to be at odds with comments that Steven Mnuchin, Treasury secretary, has made about Fannie and Freddie. Last month he said he expected the pair to continue paying dividends to the government.The document Moelis published on Thursday said the plan was ""a clear and pragmatic path to achieve important public policy goals in a manner that will both protect taxpayers for years to come and respects the property rights of shareholders"".VIDEO0:5900:59Builder confidence up, new home mortgage apps downSquawk on the StreetHowever, David Stevens, president and chief executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association, said it was ""designed to confuse unsuspecting, innocent taxpayers into supporting a plan that is intended to line the pockets of hedge funds"".He added: ""The self-interests of stock speculators and profit seekers are not in the best interests of either the taxpayer or the housing system.""Shares in Fannie Mae rallied 172 per cent after the US election, from $1.65 to a peak of $4.49 on November 30, on the hope that the Trump administration would be more amendable to recapitalising and privatising the company. Since then the stock has sunk back to $2.57.Freddie Mac similarly rose sharply after the election before tumbling back down. Both stocks dropped in February after a court ruled against hedge funds that challenged the government's hold on the agencies' profits.Paulson declined to comment.

Rosenstein said the move was in the public interest and was intended to bolster confidence in the outcome of the probe.More from NBC News:Comey 'Cleared for Takeoff' in Public Testimony Next WeekPutin: U.S. Hackers Could Have Framed RussiaLack of Job Gains Could Hamper Trump's 3 Percent Economic Growth TargetMembers of Congress called for the appointment of an outsider after the disclosure that Rosenstein drafted a memo cited by President Trump as supporting his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey.Because Mueller is only the second special counsel appointed under rules drawn up nearly two decades ago, there were few precedents to guide how he would oversee the investigation. He could have chosen to take a more removed role, instead of overseeing developments closely.""Is he going to play a direct role? Yes, he's very involved in supervising the investigation,"" said Peter Carr, the spokesman for the special counsel.Federal rules specify that a special counsel will have ""the full power and independent authority to exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions of any United States attorney.""Mueller will act much as a U.S. attorney would in supervising a local FBI investigation, Carr added.While Mueller has the option to bring in a separate group of investigators, he is so far relying on the current team working the case at the FBI, Carr said.The only other special counsel, former Sen. John Danforth, was appointed in 1999 to investigate the FBI's role in the fiery end to the standoff at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas. Because the FBI's conduct was at issue, Danforth brought in outside investigators.The immediate challenge is deciding how many people to hire, including lawyers and support staff, and how the process should be managed.Under the special counsel rules, Mueller must draw up a budget within 60 days for the remainder of the fiscal year, which ends September 30, with further budgets to come for each following year.For now, Carr said, Mueller is getting up to speed on the details of the investigation so far and assessing the management needs.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/special-counsel-robert-mueller-taking-close-control-of-russia-investigation.html

Nearly every country in the world is a signatory of the deal and Trump's decision sparked outrage both at home and abroad.The news holds significant political capital for the world's second-largest economy as it presents Chinese President Xi Jinping with a chance to boost his country's profile on the global stage.""America's difficulties are China's opportunities,"" Greenpeace East Asia's senior global policy officer Li Shuo told CNBC.The mainland has demonstrated some commitment to environmental reforms through efforts to tackle air pollution and decrease coal usage \xe2\x80\x94 national coal output fell 1.7 percent on-year in the first two months of 2017. Still, the carbon-heavy resource remains widely consumed, leaving the Asian giant as the world's largest single emitter of greenhouse gases.But in the aftermath of Trump's decision, ""there is no better time for China to further its climate leadership,"" Li said. ""The country has moved from a climate bad boy at the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit, to a cautious leader in the run up to the Paris conference, and now to a country with potential to become a true climate leader in the age of Trump.""The episode has parallels to Trump's exit from the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal earlier this year, which saw China assert itself as a champion of international trade amid a U.S. absence.Speaking on Thursday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said his country will stand by its Paris obligations, which include lowering the carbon dioxide intensity by 60 to 65 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. China and the European Union have already decided to forge ahead without Washington, according to a statement by EU climate commissioner Miguel Arias Ca\xc3\xb1ete, and the issue is expected to feature prominently in Premier Li's discussions with EU officials on Friday.President Donald Trump announces his decision that the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, U.S., June 1, 2017.Joshua Roberts | ReutersWashington's retreat also holds potential economic advantages for Beijing.""If U.S. policy shifts in favor of fossil fuels as opposed to renewable ones, in the long run China will gain the upper hand in the inevitable global move toward cleaner sources of energy,"" said Ann Carlson, professor of environmental law at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""The withdrawal of the U.S. from the global community opens up more opportunities for China.""""The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created,"" former President Barack Obama said in a statement after Trump's announcement.Trump is not legally obliged to follow his predecessor's pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions to a third of 2005 levels by 2025, but on Thursday, he claimed the county would remain environmentally friendly.Indeed, low natural gas prices are expected to support further U.S. emissions reductions, noted  Randy Kroszner, economics professor at the University of Chicago and former Federal Reserve Governor. In fact, he added, Beijing is the one most in need of reform: ""The key for world climate change is China.""For its part, Asia's largest economy is already taking steps to mitigate the impact Washington's exit from the Paris deal.The EU and China are expected to announce intensified joint measures to reduce carbon emissions in a statement later on Friday, including developing more green technology and helping to raise $100 billion a year by 2020 to help poorer countries cut emissions, Reuters reported. ""China is already cutting emissions faster than predicted,"" noted Carlson.Beijing's new diplomatic approach to environmental issues could also boost international efforts, said Li, noting how China's ambassador to the UN pledged in March to help bridge climate negotiations.""This is a significant progress from the traditional approach of 'hide your capability and bide your time.' China now is invested in multilateral climate governance. Its leaders are taking ownership of this issue,"" Li said. ""This is an area that Chinese political and economic efforts can partly offset America's retreat.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/china-to-benefit-from-trumps-climate-decree.html
446,Here's the real reason Hillary lost the election,Politics,02-06-2017,"VIDEO2:2902:29Hillary speaks out about election defeatSquawk BoxI'm going to do something unpopular now. I'm going to defend Hillary Clinton.The Democrats' 2016 nominee has reemerged recently, sitting for  a lengthy profile with New York magazine's Rebecca Traister and giving a series of interviews,  including one at Recode's Code Media conference. (Disclosure: Recode, like Vox, is owned by Vox Media.) It's not been a smooth return to the public eye. The political press wants self-flagellation, but Clinton is  placing the blame for her Electoral College loss elsewhere: on James Comey, on the media, on sexism, on fake news, on the Democratic Party's infrastructure. ""I take responsibility for every decision I made, but that's not why I lost,"" she said.This has not gone over well. ""Hillary Clinton's list of who's to blame for her 2016 election loss gets longer with every passing day,""  wrote CNN's Chris Cillizza. For once, Donald Trump and the pundit class are in lockstep:TweetMore from Vox:Don't just blame Trump for quitting the Paris deal \xe2\x80\x94 blame the Republican Party  Jared Kushner is the domino Trump can least afford to fall in the Russia investigation  An incredibly telling thing Trump said at today's Paris event wasn't about climate at allThis discussion conflates two very different questions. One is: Why did Clinton lose? And there, factors like Comey, Russia, and the media's email obsession have real explanatory power. But the harder question \xe2\x80\x94 the one this blame game is designed to obscure \xe2\x80\x94 is why was the election close enough for Clinton to lose?Clinton made mistakes. But they're not why she lost.Clinton does herself no favors when she  suggests that criticism of the paid speeches she gave to Goldman Sachs was motivated by sexism. There was sexism in the 2016 election, as I discuss below. But in 2013, amid an economy wracked by the aftermath of the financial crisis, and after Clinton served in a government that bailed out the financial sector, you didn't need to be a political genius to recognize that taking $675,000 from the vampire squid might look bad.Nor is Clinton's complaint that the Democratic Party lacked campaign infrastructure convincing. You know who lacked campaign infrastructure? Donald J. Trump. His field operation was a joke. The RNC's efforts were a shaky backstop. The 2016 election didn't prove the Democrats needed a better ground game. It proved a better ground game wasn't enough.Clinton made mistakes. All candidates do. But the question in elections is ... compared to what? Take the criticisms made of Clinton and turn them around. Trump surely did not run a smoother campaign than Clinton. His team featured more infighting, leaking, and churn. He made more obvious mistakes in a week than she made in a year. His finances were far shadier than Clinton's, his foundation far less ethical, his behavior far more erratic. He walked into the debates unprepared, ran a bizarre and ineffective convention, and appears to have been saved from defeat \xe2\x80\x94 albeit narrow defeat \xe2\x80\x94 by the twin interventions of Russia and James Comey.And Clinton was, in ways people have rewritten since her Electoral College loss, an effective candidate in nontraditional ways. After she captured the Democratic nomination, I wrote  a piece about the political skills that made her the first woman to achieve that feat. I occasionally see the article thrown back at me as a laughable analysis disproven by her eventual loss, but I think it's absolutely correct:She won the Democratic primary by spending years slowly, assiduously, building relationships with the entire Democratic Party. She relied on a more traditionally female approach to leadership: creating coalitions, finding common ground, and winning over allies. Today, 208 members of Congress have  endorsed Clinton; only eight have endorsed [Bernie] Sanders.[...] In order to do something as hard as becoming the first female presidential nominee of a major political party, [Clinton] had to do something extraordinarily difficult: She had to build a coalition, supported by a web of relationships, that dwarfed in both breadth and depth anything a non-incumbent had created before. It was a plan that played to her strengths, as opposed to her (entirely male) challengers' strengths. And she did it.Hillary Clinton is a generationally talented politician \xe2\x80\x94 albeit across a different set of dimensions than men tend to be talented politicians.Similarly, Clinton really did crush Trump in the debates. As I  wrote then, most presidential debates have little effect on the polls. Clinton's performances were unusual in that they transformed the race. On the eve of the first debate, Trump and Clinton were basically tied. By the close of the third, Clinton had opened up a massive lead \xe2\x80\x94 a lead that, if retained, would certainly have won her the election.It also must be said:  Many of Clinton's strengths were hidden by our gendered expectations of leaders \xe2\x80\x94 what she was good at would have been important for her presidency, but it is not what 44 male presidents in a row have taught us to expect, or even to see. Anyone who thinks sexism isn't a force in American politics should have a good answer to the question of why, in a country that's more than half women, there has never been a female president and, aside from Clinton, no woman has ever come close to winning a major party's nomination.If Trump won because of Clinton's mistakes, then we don't need to ask hard questionsI understand why people want to castigate Clinton, and why they want to see Clinton castigate herself. Her loss devastated many, and her mistakes offer an easy answer to an election that poses awful questions. If Trump won merely because Clinton was such a crummy candidate, then we don't have to ask how someone like Trump could win, and whether it could happen again, perhaps with someone even worse.But there is an oddity in the way both Trump and Cillizza frame the election as an equation with only one input: Hillary Clinton's performance. What about Trump's appeal? And what about the voters' preferences, which are surely not so easily swayed by marginal changes in campaign strategy? (Also, why is Trump taking time out of his day to argue that the politician he lost the popular vote to was ""a terrible candidate""? Does he not recognize what that implies?)By the end of the campaign, the public had enough information to make basic judgments about who Clinton and Trump were. Trump's flaws weren't hidden by Clinton's mistakes \xe2\x80\x94 if she was good at anything, it was goading Trump into error and overreaction. Voters knew what he was when they voted for him. They had seen him lash out at a Gold Star family and at Alicia Machado. They knew he suggested, repeatedly, that Ted Cruz's father was involved in the JFK assassination. They had heard him say Mexico was sending us rapists and criminals and call for a ban on Muslim travel. They had watched him babble incoherently about policy, say he could shoot someone in broad daylight without losing support, and brag, on tape, ""when you're a star, they let you do it.""And it's worth remembering that before Clinton ran against Trump, 16 other Republicans ran against him \xe2\x80\x94 a group that observers thought to be the most talented field the GOP had seen in decades. And every one of them was routed. At some point, the record of talented politicians lying at Trump's feet requires more explanation than ""they all screwed up.""Imagine a slightly alternate universe. Let's take Nate Silver's  estimate that the Comey letter cost Clinton about 3 percentage points in the election. Imagine it never happened. Now Clinton wins the Electoral College, and lands a bigger popular vote victory than Barack Obama did against Mitt Romney.In that world, are we talking about what an awful race President Clinton ran? We aren't. But that is a world in which Trump \xe2\x80\x94 with all he revealed during the campaign about his lack of discipline, his casual cruelty, his disinterest in policy, his penchant for conspiracy theories \xe2\x80\x94 still won about 44 percent of the vote.That is a world, in other words, that should still trouble us.

448,"Fyre Festival was bad. For the concert industry, this one could be worse.",Media,02-06-2017,"Rapper Wiz Khalifa performs at the Pemberton Music Festival on July 16, 2016 in Pemberton, Canada.Andrew Chin | Getty ImagesFor the concert industry, the disastrous failure of the  Fyre Festival in the Bahamas was an outlier \xe2\x80\x94 a sad spectacle, but an isolated one.But the collapse of another event, the Pemberton Music Festival in the mountains of Canada, has put the business on edge, with veteran talent agents and promoters warning that it could have wide implications for the booming festival market.Pemberton, planned for July 13 to 16 with acts including Chance the Rapper, Muse and A Tribe Called Quest, was abruptly canceled on May 18, when the two companies behind it declared bankruptcy. In a break from standard practice, ticket holders were not offered refunds, but were instead told that they could ""file a proof of claim form as an unsecured creditor.""More from New York Times: Airbnb hosts more likely to reject the disabled, a study findsHigh Times is sold to group that includes son of Bob MarleyBarbara Corcoran on the power of a positive attitudeMusic executives are now aghast over the failure to provide refunds and the maneuvering of investors in the weeks before the festival fell apart. Marc Geiger, the head of music at William Morris Endeavor and an outspoken voice in the business, called Pemberton's collapse ""a fraud and a scam"" that could have a domino effect on the industry, hurting smaller promoters the most.""This could be the symbolic end for independently promoted festivals,"" he said.Pemberton, held in a picturesque spot about 100 miles north of Vancouver, British Columbia, was a typical entry into the frothy festival business. It was revived in 2014 by Huka Entertainment, a well-known independent promoter, after an earlier iteration failed. According to bankruptcy filings, the festival lost money for three years, and sold 18,000 tickets in 2017, down from 38,000 last year.After the cancellation, fans took to social media to vent and mock using the hashtag  #PembyFest. The complaints were not quite the supernova that followed the dissolution of the Fyre Festival, when planeloads of millennials arrived to find a ramshackle site that was far from the luxurious beach paradise they had been sold.But the collapse of both Fyre and Pemberton has once again focused the industry's attention on what has become a perennial question: Has the ever-expanding festival market hit its peak? High-profile failures like Pemberton and Fyre \xe2\x80\x94 which is now facing numerous lawsuits from ticket buyers and others \xe2\x80\x94 could erode consumer confidence, Mr. Geiger said.Then there is simply natural competition, as more festivals are added to the calendar.""Well-produced and curated events at a site the public loves will continue to do well,"" said Gary Bongiovanni, the editor of the trade publication Pollstar. ""But too many events mean the best will survive and the weak will wither.""World-famous events like  Coachella began as risky endeavors undertaken by small promoters. If the credit markets for festivals grow too tight, there may be no room for such innovation, said Sam Hunt, an agent with Paradigm Talent Agency whose artists Major Lazer and Run the Jewels had both been booked for Pemberton.""This industry thrives on a variety of creative individuals doing things in new and creative ways,"" Mr. Hunt said. ""If they become more constrained, everybody loses.""Mr. Geiger reserves a special ire for Pemberton's investors, among them several wealthy Canadians with no background in the music business. As secured creditors, they now stand a better chance of getting their money back than the fans who paid $275 a ticket. One investor, Amanda Girling, is also chief executive of a company that owns the land on which the festival was held, and which is  for sale for $12.5 million.In filings, the two entities that controlled the festival \xe2\x80\x94 Pemberton Music Festival Limited Partnership and 1115666 B.C. Ltd. \xe2\x80\x94 declared $5 million in assets and $12.5 million in liabilities, with ticket holders listed as having an unsecured claim of $6 million. The first meeting of creditors is scheduled for June 6 in Vancouver.Further muddying the Pemberton situation are questions of control, with Mr. Geiger and others accusing the organizers of swapping shell companies for the investors' benefit. In April, the investors created 1115666 B.C. and made it general partner of Pemberton Music Festival Limited Partnership, which controlled the festival.William E. J. Skelly, a lawyer for the investors, said in an email that the new company was created to give the directors ""greater management control and transparency"" over the event's finances.Less than a month later, the investors resigned as directors of the newly formed company and, the very next day, declared both companies bankrupt.""The fact that somebody decided to stick it to the consumer, not deliver any product, and say they are protected by bankruptcy, is hideous,"" Mr. Geiger said.Funds from ticket sales are often held by ticketing companies in case an event is canceled, but smaller promoters may depend on advances to pay expenses. Pemberton's ticketing company, Ticketfly, paid the festival operators each week, Mr. Skelly said. Ticketfly declined to comment.Mr. Geiger likened this process to the easy availability of credit before the housing crisis, and said the fallout from Pemberton meant that the financing arrangements behind festivals will most likely be tightened. Ticketing companies will be reluctant to pay advances, and artists will demand more money upfront, he said. If that happens, the only companies that could meet the multimillion-dollar capital requirements to stage a large event would be corporate players like Live Nation and AEG.""It may be an advantage for the bigger guys,"" said Peter Shapiro, an independent promoter behind Brooklyn Bowl and the Lockn' festival in Virginia. ""But for the new guys starting out, it's going to be a much more difficult environment.""Some longtime players in the concert industry see these developments as a consequence of the growing corporatization of the business. That process began in the 1990s and has gone through another wave lately, with small promoters bought out by Live Nation and AEG. In this landscape, independents are finding it harder and harder to compete.""What we're witnessing now is a result of what's been going on now for more than 10 years with the consolidation of the music industry,"" said John Scher, a veteran promoter in New York and New Jersey.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/fyre-festival-was-bad-for-the-concert-industry-this-one-could-be-worse.html

That recovery is seen continuing after OPEC's decision last week to keep a lid on production for another nine months, a move that helps to prop up oil prices.The resilience of American producers underscores how OPEC has struggled to adapt to U.S. oil supply that can be quickly tapped as it becomes profitable to pump.Saudi Arabia tried unsuccessfully for two years to wash high-cost U.S. producers out of the market by letting prices plummet. The top OPEC exporter then coordinated a 1.8 million barrels a day output cut among two dozen countries, but was forced last week to extend the deal because it failed to shrink global stockpiles \xe2\x80\x94 in no small part due to resurgent U.S. production.At the OPEC meeting, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said rising drilling costs in the U.S. oil patch could soon rein in production. He also noted that drillers are burning through their best, lowest-cost acreage.But quarterly reports from drillers and oilfield services firms belie those claims, Barclays said in a research note. The reports indicate exploration and production companies can keep drilling the most cost-effective resources for several more years, the bank says.American drillers ""will moderate activity only if prices constrain activity. At current price levels, many producers will continue to meet or exceed their 2017 production guidance,"" Barclays wrote.VIDEO2:5302:53Cost of US shale will go up, but only 10-15 percent: BAMLStreet Signs EuropeWhile costs are indeed rising in Texas's Permian basin, the epicenter of the shale recovery, more efficient drilling methods are offsetting that inflation, analysts say.Bank of America Merrill Lynch forecasts costs will rise just 10 to 15 percent, about half the rate seen by others, as the industry addresses pockets of cost pressure. Those include a shortage of workers, sand and pressure pumping capacity needed for hydraulic fracturing \xe2\x80\x94 the process of freeing oil and gas from shale rock by pummeling it with water, minerals and chemicals.""People will come back into the market and we may also see availability of mine sand go up later this year or in early 2018. So there will be cost inflation, but not that much,"" Sabine Schels, head of fundamental commodities research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told CNBC.VIDEO3:2203:22Expect an extraordinary delta in shale production: Goldman SachsSquawk Box EuropeGoldman Sachs is taking a more conservative view. The firm sees costs rising about 30 percent from the trough. At the same time, the average cost necessary to break even on producing oil in the U.S. has stopped falling and has stabilized around $50 to $55 a barrel, Michele Della Vigna, co-head of European equities at Goldman Sachs, told CNBC last week.But Goldman does not necessarily think inflation will be what eventually kills shale growth. That will happen only when lenders stop offering drillers cheap credit.That easy money will underwrite investment in new production not just in the Permian basin, but also in other areas in Texas and Oklahoma, Della Vigna said.""We think it's a broad renaissance of shale led by incredibly cheap credit, with even sub-investment grade [exploration and production] companies today borrowing at just 7 percent on the high yield market,"" he said.The U.S. Energy Department projects drilling will pick up this month in regions beyond the Permian, including in North Dakota and Colorado.Houston-based drillers are able to make money with oil prices as low as $40 a barrel, IHS Markit Chairman Daniel Yergin said following a trip through the region.If anything snuffs out growth in the oil patch, it could be the law of large numbers, according to Yergin. It will be hard for drillers to keep up the same growth pace next year following the surge in 2017, he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" last week.That may explain why OPEC and other exporters decided to extend output cuts into the first quarter of 2018.""I think that's the kind of viewpoint OPEC took, that they've got to run this thing into next year,"" he said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/us-oil-output-to-grow-more-even-as-drillers-costs-rise-analysts-say.html

The unemployment rate declined to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent, but that was because of a drop in the labor force participation rate.More broadly, though, the numbers serve as a reminder that hopes for breakout growth this year are likely to be dashed, and in fairly short order. As Washington lawmakers struggle to push through any aspects of President Donald Trump's pro-growth agenda, the reality is sinking in that any gains now are likely to be felt in 2018 at least or perhaps even longer.Talk of ""animal spirits"" in January and February \xe2\x80\x94 with their respective payroll gains of 216,000 and 232,000 \xe2\x80\x94 is now replaced with expectations for more of the same as 2017 plays out.""It just seems as if lower employment gains in part are consistent with the demographics and labor force participation rates in the U.S.,"" said John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo.

We're now dealing with 160,000 or 180,000 for the rest of the year, if we're lucky.""That's not the way it was supposed to be, but it now appears the chatter earlier this year was misplaced.""It was a head fake in the sense that some people believed that we were going to have a lot of economic policy actions early,"" Silvia added. ""It's still legitimate to say that we're going to have those policy actions that may affect 2018. But a lot of people built up too much optimism about how quickly economic policy gets through Washington.""For its part, the Trump administration tried to put a happy face on the numbers Friday.Gary Cohn, Trump's chief economic advisor, told CNBC that he remains confident in the progress of the economy and said, ""We have to create a better and better job market in the United States."" However, his bragging that the administration is ""clearly bringing people back into the job force"" is a little misleading.Miguel Riopa | AFP | Getty ImagesIn fact, the labor force has increased by just 68,000 through the first five months, well below the 148,000 for the same period in 2016 and the 425,000 in 2015. Though the unemployment rate that includes discouraged and underemployed workers has dropped a full percentage point this year to 8.4 percent, the labor force and its composition remain a problem for broader economic growth.""We expected the jobs market to take a slight breather, with 185,000 for May, but including the downward revisions the month before, this report feels more like an early summer vacation instead of a pause,"" Beth Ann Bovino, chief U.S. economist at S&P Global Ratings, said in a note. ""Given reports that job openings are near all-time highs, it suggests that businesses are struggling to fill these positions in an increasingly tighter market.""Economists and Federal Reserve policymakers also remain baffled at the lack of positive inflation signs, in particular wage increases.Average hourly earnings are rising at just a 2.5 percent pace \xe2\x80\x94 Deutsche Bank called it ""the new 3 percent"" \xe2\x80\x94 even though jobs seem harder to come by. Tightness in the labor market should be pushing harder on wages, but that does not appear to be the case.The tepid wage pressures along with ""further evidence of a still-modest consumer,  restrained business investment, and tepid domestic manufacturing, undermines the notion of better conditions or a more robust economic picture lurking around the corner,"" said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income.Stocks still rising, but bonds are scaredTo be sure, the financial markets don't seem to mind.Despite yet another weak economic signal, the stock market went on its merry way Friday, with major averages posting slight gains heading into midday.The bond market, however, has been telling another story, consistently forecasting much more lukewarm growth than its equity counterpart. As is often the case, at least in terms of the economic picture, it's an ongoing argument that fixed income seems to be winning.That's critical as the Fed prepares for a likely rate hike later this month. Fed Governor Lael Brainard earlier this week spoke about the inflation issue, saying that it ""is a source of concern,"" and pointed out that inflation has remained below the Fed's 2 percent target for 58 straight months, or nearly five years.""Fundamentally, growth is slower than people have penciled in for the year,"" said Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab. ""The bond market is not concerned that the Fed is behind the curve \xe2\x80\x94 it may be concerned that the Fed s a little ahead of the curve. The bond market is currently not seeing the world the same way as the stock market.""The world itself seems more complicated than one where a little pro-growth rhetoric about lower taxes, less regulation and more infrastructure spending would cast a spell over the economy and push growth higher.Wells Fargo's Silvia believes the labor market problems specifically require more complicated solutions.""There are some tax policy changes, some regulatory policies that could be done. More fundamentally, it's microeconomics,"" he said. ""It's trying to get people talking about skills mismatch. ... We need to focus a lot more on education, the opioid epidemic, we need to think about the labor force participation rate for women.""""These are the micro policies, not the macro policies you see on TV,"" he added.

Christiana Figueres, a former top United Nations climate official, said there was currently no formal mechanism for entities that were not countries to be full parties to the Paris accord.Ms. Figueres, who described the Trump administration's decision to withdraw as a ""vacuous political melodrama,"" said the American government was required to continue reporting its emissions to the United Nations because a formal withdrawal would not take place for several years.But Ms. Figueres, the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change until last year, said the Bloomberg group's submission could be included in future reports the United Nations compiled on the progress made by the signatories of the Paris deal.There are 195 countries committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions as part of the 2015 agreement.Still, producing what Mr. Bloomberg described as a ""parallel"" pledge would indicate that leadership in the fight against climate change in the United States had shifted from the federal government to lower levels of government, academia and industry.Mr. Bloomberg, a United Nations envoy on climate, is a political independent who has been among the critics of Mr. Trump's climate and energy policies.Mayors of cities including Los Angeles, Atlanta and Salt Lake City have signed on \xe2\x80\x94 along with Pittsburgh, which Mr. Trump mentioned in his speech announcing the withdrawal \xe2\x80\x94 as have Hewlett-Packard, Mars and dozens of other companies.Eighty-two presidents and chancellors of universities including Emory, Brandeis and Wesleyan are also participating, the organizers said.Mr. Trump's plan to pull out of the Paris agreement was motivating more local and state governments, as well as businesses, to commit to the climate change fight, said Robert C. Orr, one of the architects of the 2015 Paris agreement as the United Nations secretary-general's lead climate adviser.On Thursday, Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and Gov. Jerry Brown of California, all Democrats, said they were beginning a separate alliance of states committed to upholding the Paris accord.VIDEO1:4001:40Trump announces he's pulling America out of Paris Climate Agreement Digital Original""The electric jolt of the last 48 hours is accelerating this process that was already underway,"" said Mr. Orr, who is now dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland. ""It's not just the volume of actors that is increasing, it's that they are starting to coordinate in a much more integral way.""The United States is about halfway to its 2025 emissions reduction target, Mr. Orr said. Of the remaining reductions, the federal government \xe2\x80\x94 through regulations like gas mileage standards for vehicles \xe2\x80\x94 could affect about half.But in a draft letter to Ant\xc3\xb3nio Guterres, the United Nations secretary-general, Mr. Bloomberg expressed confidence that ""non-national actors"" could achieve the 2025 goal alone.""While the executive branch of the U.S. government speaks on behalf of our nation in matters of foreign affairs, it does not determine many aspects of whether and how the United States takes action on climate change,"" he wrote.""The bulk of the decisions which drive U.S. climate action in the aggregate are made by cities, states, businesses, and civil society,"" he wrote. ""Collectively, these actors remain committed to the Paris accord.""Cities and states can reduce emissions in many ways, including negotiating contracts with local utilities to supply greater amounts of renewable energy, building rapid transit programs and other infrastructure projects like improved wastewater treatment. Similarly, corporations can take measures like buying renewable energy for their offices and factories, or making sure their supply chains are climate-friendly.Governor Inslee said that states held significant sway over emissions. Washington, for example, has adopted a cap on carbon pollution, has invested in growing clean energy jobs and subsidizes  electric vehicle purchases and charging stations.""Our states will move forward, even if the president wants to go backward,"" he said in a telephone interview.America's biggest corporations have been bracing for the United States to exit from the Paris climate accord, a move executives and analysts say would bring few tangible benefits to businesses \xe2\x80\x94 but plenty of backlash.Multinational companies will still need to follow ever-stricter emissions laws that other countries are adopting, no matter the location of their headquarters. Automakers like Ford Motor and General Motors would still need to build cars that meet stringent fuel economy and emissions standards in the European Union, Japan and even China,  not to mention California.American companies also face the wrath of overseas consumers for abandoning what has been a popular global agreement \xe2\x80\x94 customers who could buy more Renaults instead of Chevrolets or Reeboks instead of Nikes.""Pulling out of Paris would be the worst thing for brand America since Abu Ghraib,"" said Nigel Purvis, a top environmental negotiator in the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations and the chief executive of Climate Advisers, a consulting firm.""Mars stands by the Paris Climate Agreement,"" said Grant Reid, the chief executive of Mars. The company, best known for its candies, remained committed, he said, to achieving ""the carbon reduction targets the planet needs.""It was unclear from Mr. Trump's announcement what commitments the United States would honor in the Paris accord, which include contributions to the operating budget of the accord's coordinating agency, the framework convention.But Bloomberg Philanthropies, Mr. Bloomberg's charitable organization, is offering to donate $14 million over the next two years to help fund the budget should it be needed, a spokeswoman said. That figure represents the United States' share, she said.Jackie Biskupski, the mayor of Salt Lake City and a Democrat, said her administration had recently brokered an agreement with the local utility to power the city with 100 percent renewable energy by 2032.Global warming is having a significant impact in Utah, she said, especially on water availability and quality.

Shahira Knight can weigh in on retirement matters even though she previously worked for Fidelity, a financial company specializing in retirement services.The White House late Wednesday posted on its website ethics waivers granted to four ex-lobbyists and numerous others who have joined government. In all, the White House has granted 14 ethics waivers.U.S. President Donald Trump speaks in the Rose Garden at the White House on June 1, 2017 in Washington DC.Win McNamee | Getty ImagesThe disclosures come after a tussle between the Office of Government Ethics and White House lawyers. Other executive branch agencies and departments, such as Treasury, State and Defense, are expected to share similar information with OGE by Thursday. The Office of Management and Budget responded to the OGE's request for data last week by saying it had issued zero waivers.As part of his pledge to ""drain the swamp"" of Washington, President Donald Trump prohibits senior officials hired into the executive branch from working on ""particular"" government matters that involve their former clients or employers for two years. President Barack Obama placed similar restrictions on his employees \xe2\x80\x94 and granted ethics waivers. His White House also posted those exceptions on its website.The Trump administration waivers include four for former registered lobbyists. The rest are for other employees whose new government duties may overlap with their previous private jobs. Several are ""blanket"" waivers for groups of employees.The White House waivers were vetted by White House counsel Don McGahn and Stefan Passantino, the chief ethics officer. The White House says it only grants waivers if those lawyers find it's too impractical for the person to recuse from the ethics issues triggered by their past work.VIDEO2:0402:04White House: Paris agreement is 'a bad deal for Americans'Power Lunch""To the furthest extent possible, counsel worked with each staffer to recuse from conflicting conduct rather than being granted waivers, which has led to the limited number of waivers being issued,"" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said.Some waivers cover the highest-profile White House employees.For example, there's a ""blanket"" waiver saying all presidential appointees ""may participate in communications and meetings with news organizations regarding broad policy matters."" That clears the way, ethically, for Steve Bannon, Breitbart's former chief executive and now Trump's chief strategist, to ring up reporters at the news site.That's important because Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington \xe2\x80\x94 a liberal-funded pro-transparency group that has lodged many complaints against the Trump administration \xe2\x80\x94 had argued in a complaint that Bannon was violating the ethics pledge by speaking with his former employees.Another waiver explicitly allows Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to Trump, to contact and interact with clients of her political polling company.Joshua Pitcock, who had been Indiana's sole lobbyist in Washington and now serves as Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff, is permitted under a waiver to stay in the room when matters involving Indiana arise.VIDEO1:2401:24Focus turns to Jared Kushner after Trump's overseas tripSquawk Box""It is important that you be able to communicate and meet with the State of Indiana, and disqualification from such meetings or communications would limit the ability of the Office of the Vice President to effectively carry out Administration priorities,"" his waiver says.Catanzaro and Knight have drawn some of the most intense scrutiny of government watchdogs because their new jobs seem to closely align with their private-sector lobbying. That raised questions about how they were able to circumvent Trump's ethics rules.The answer is spelled out in the new documents: They obtained waivers.As a lobbyist for CGCN Group, Catanzaro's clients included Devon Energy, an oil and gas company based in Oklahoma, and other energy providers. In the Trump administration, he's a special assistant to the president, focusing on energy policies.Catanzaro's duties can include ""broad policy matters and particular matters of general applicability relating to energy and environmental policy issues,"" according to his waiver.

Griffin's actions, which drew direct rebukes from Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, has set in motion a formal investigation. The Secret Service will question the actress.And on consecutive days in Washington, a man was stopped by officers attempting scale a bike rack ringing the perimeter of the White House on Tuesday, while agents assisted in the arrest of man on weapons offenses at the nearby Trump International Hotel one day later.Alles, the first director selected from outside the agency in 70 years, did acknowledge however that the size of the current president's family and his multiple residences have placed added ""stress'' on the agency's protective division which has carried a crushing workload since Pope Francis' 2015 visit to the U.S. The visit, which required an enormous security operation, was followed quickly by a contentious election season and January's inauguration.""There are more places we have to protect by statute,'' Alles said, referring to Trump's frequent retreats in Florida, New Jersey and his home located in Manhattan's Trump Tower. ""That and the fact that he has a large family. That's just more stress on the organization. We recognize that. It's not something I have any flexibility on.""I can't change the size of the president's family,'' Alles said, chuckling. ""Nor will I attempt to do that.''Just 38 days on the job, Alles did outline an ambitious agenda to increase the size of the agency from its current 6,800 agents and uniform officers to 9,500 by 2025. The bolstered force is needed, he said, to improve persistent morale problems caused by unpredictable staffing demands and limited funds to pay overtime.In October, USA TODAY reported that slightly more than 1,000 agents \xe2\x80\x93 about a third of the agent workforce \xe2\x80\x93 had maxed out annual overtime and salary allowances. Many of them had reached their limits in June and were not eligible for overtime during the national political conventions, which the agency secures.The disclosure prompted Congress to approve additional funding to cover the overtime costs, but that fix only applied to last year's overtime expenditures.Unless Congress approves a permanent fix, Alles said a ""couple hundred'' agents and officers will max out their pay allowances this year.""The mission is inflexible,'' the director said.With the agency dogged in recent years by a series of security breaches, some lawmakers have called for the agency to shed its responsibilities for counterfeiting, cyber crime and child exploitation investigations to focus solely on its protective mission.Past directors have resisted those proposals and Alles said he would, too.He said the agency's investigative responsibilities were ""integral'' to building relationships with local law enforcement agencies that also assist the Secret Service's protective mission when the president and others travel outside Washington.Alles also expressed concern that if the agency's investigative responsibilities were removed, the enforcement of counterfeiting, some financial cyber crimes and child sex abuse would ""go undone.''",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/secret-service-trump-faces-same-number-of-threats-as-obama.html
457,Don't just blame Trump for dumping Paris deal,Politics,02-06-2017,"President Donald Trump is seated for a a lunch with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (L) and House Speaker Paul Ryan.Mandel Ngan | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement has been portrayed in some press coverage as a decision driven by either his personal idiosyncrasies or the policy agenda of White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. And while there's an element of truth to that, it misses the big picture.The reality is that this isn't just a story about Trump \xe2\x80\x94 it's a story about the Republican Party and the conservative movement, which has adopted a rock-solid, widespread consensus in opposition to any serious action aimed at the US reducing carbon emissions. This has become a bedrock belief of the modern GOP.While we can't know if any other Republican president elected in 2016 would have for sure withdrawn from the Paris agreement, many institutional actors within the GOP and the conservative movement \xe2\x80\x94 from members of Congress (including the Senate majority leader) to think tanks to activist groups to media outlets to conservative donors (including many with fossil fuel wealth) \xe2\x80\x94 strongly support this move and have in fact been urging Trump to make it.Furthermore, even leading Republicans who might have supported sticking to the Paris deal \xe2\x80\x94 it is, after all, non-binding \xe2\x80\x94 would have likely supported an agenda of weakening environmental regulations and taken little if any action aimed at reducing carbon emissions.The party simply does not believe climate change is a serious problem. The talking points differ: Some deny humans are causing the planet to warm at all and say the very idea is a liberal hoax (their number  includes President Trump). More nuanced pundits and politicians acknowledge that the science is real, but argue that even if it is accurate, the consequences might not be so bad, or that action would simply be too costly.More from Vox: Rolling back the birth control mandate is part of a much larger GOP strategy The legal risks of Jared Kushner's meeting with a Russian banker, explained The GOP's ""Hillary Slayer"" will soon be in charge of investigating Trump in the HouseBut beyond a few notable exceptions, the upshot is generally the same no matter where someone sits in the GOP: that addressing climate change shouldn't be anywhere near the top of the president's agenda. This is the consensus that the vast majority of the Republican Party, from donors to politicians to intellectuals to voters, has arrived at. Which makes it the crucial context for Trump's move Thursday.Trump had widespread support in the conservative coalition for pulling out of the Paris dealThough Trump's withdrawal from the Paris agreement has been received by some as a shocking move, it was hardly a fringe position in the Republican Party \xe2\x80\x94 he was being outright pressured to do it.Twenty-two Republican senators, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,  sent a letter to Trump in May urging him to withdraw from the accord.Forty conservative think tanks or activist groups, including the Heritage Foundation, Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform, the Koch brothers' Americans for Prosperity, and the longtime climate science\xe2\x80\x93denying Heartland Institute,  signed on to a similar letter calling on Trump to pull out.Pro-Trump conservative media outlets like Fox News and Breitbart praised the move as expected \xe2\x80\x94 but so did the Trump-critical National Review, with top editor Rich Lowry saying it was the right call on Twitter and writer David French (who once considered waging an  independent presidential run against Trump) authoring  a post headlined"" Trump defends the Constitution and the economy by withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement.""And back when the Paris deal was first struck in late 2015, other GOP presidential candidates harshly criticized it too. Marco Rubio called it an  ""unfunny joke,"" John Kasich  mocked the idea of a ""climate conference over in Paris"" when they ""should have been talking about destroying ISIS,"" Ted Cruz  promised to withdraw from the agreement, and  Jeb Bush said he probably wouldn't have attended the negotiations because they'd likely result in ""policies that will hurt our economy.""Even many Republicans who wouldn't go so far as quitting Paris do support the core of Trump's climate agendaBut whether the US stayed in the Paris agreement or not, it was crystal clear both before and after Thursday's announcement that the vast majority of the Republican Party supports an agenda of environmental deregulation and inaction on climate change.Take Trump's nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt. All along, it was clear that Pruitt would be a rock-solid opponent of federal regulatory efforts aimed at reducing carbon emissions. As  Brad Plumer wrote last year, during Pruitt's tenure as Oklahoma attorney general, he ""joined or led state lawsuits to block virtually every major federal regulation around climate and air pollution that Obama's EPA has put forward,"" and professed to believe that the science around climate change was unsettled.Anyone even remotely concerned about climate change should naturally have opposed Pruitt's nomination to head the US's top environmental regulatory agency, and yet the sole Republican senator who  voted against Pruitt's confirmation was Susan Collins of Maine. The vast majority of the party's politicians simply do not think it's a problem to appoint an EPA administrator who doesn't take the climate science consensus seriously.The same is true of the GOP's grassroots: In  a 2016 Pew survey, only 23 percent of Republican voters said they believed Earth was getting warmer because of human activity.The occasional notable Republican politician who does conclude that the scientific consensus is accurate and tries to work with Democrats on the issue gets slammed by these passionate and well-organized groups, and can face serious pressure from the right \xe2\x80\x94  as happened to Lindsey Graham when he was working on a cap-and-trade bill in 2010 and  got attacked by Fox News. So it's no surprise that most in the party decide not to stick their necks out, lest they run afoul of the base and risk a primary challenge.Even Mitt Romney, one of the few major Republicans who  openly called on Trump to stay in the Paris agreement in recent weeks, dodged and obfuscated on climate change when he was actually running for president and facing electoral pressures. ""We don't know what's causing climate change,"" he  said in October 2011. ""I'm not in this race to slow the rise of the oceans or to heal the planet,"" he  joked in August 2012. He only  started acknowledging the seriousness of the issue in 2015, years after his loss.The reality is that one of the US's two major political parties is institutionally committed at nearly every level to the same basic agenda of environmental deregulation and inaction on carbon emissions. Trump's withdrawal in Paris isn't an odd outlier, but instead rests on that foundation.Commentary by Andrew Prokop, a politics reporter at Vox.

Ansip's comments during a CNBC-hosted panel on Thursday at the Pioneers tech conference in Vienna, made it clear that he doesn't back Gates' view.""The aim of taxation is not just (to) collect revenues \xe2\x80\xa6 But to increase salaries of teachers and police. Taxes are also to have some influence over some processes. I fully agree that we have to tax bad habits, for example pollution, or smoking, or drinking alcoholic drinks, this I can understand.""  Ansip said that he was not in favor of ""taxing progress"" as others would take a lead in areas such as artificial intelligence, leaving Europe behind.VIDEO3:2103:21Gates: Robot tax would slow down automationClosing BellEarlier this year, billionaire Gates proposed a tax on robots.  ""If a human worker does $50,000 of work in a factory, that income is taxed,"" Gates said in an interview with Quartz. ""If a robot comes in to do the same thing, you'd think we'd tax the robot at a similar level.""   Universal basic incomeThe panel on Thursday focused on the impact on jobs and society from automation and AI (artificial intelligence) technology. In these areas, major Silicon Valley names such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg have backed the idea of a universal basic income (UBI) - a policy in which every citizen in a certain country receives a regular, but equal amount of money regardless of whether they are employed or not.  When asked if this is a policy the European Commission is thinking about, Ansip said, ""not yet"". He explained that even with new technologies such as Apple's iPad or smartphones, people have ended up being available 24 hours a day. Ansip's point was that new technology has created more work, and there is no reason why automation won't do the same.VIDEO1:2601:26Robots, A.I. and bitcoin the focus of Pioneers tech conferenceSquawk Box EuropeBut at the same time, he warned that people should be afraid of the impact of artificial intelligence on jobs, and urged governments to prepare.

The company makes programmable friendship bracelets for girls that can sync up, send secret messages and be coded for different functionalities.""I was five years into my career before I worked with another woman, and another five years before I worked with another one,"" Chipps, 36, said. ""I really just wanted to change that environment.""Chipps began coding at age 11 and dropped out of Penn State, where she was studying computer science, to head into the workforce, going on to co-found Girl Develop It in 2010. The nonprofit provides affordable opportunities for adult women to learn how to code via in-person classes, now in 50 cities nationwide, with more than 60,000 women served. She met Moreland that same year, after being hired to do some programming for Moreland's start-up Fashism, a fashion photo-sharing app for teenage girls.""I thought it was really great to work with an engineer who was a woman,"" Moreland said. The two stayed friends, and when Chipps had the idea for Jewelbots, Moreland quit what she was doing to help co-found the company in 2014, talking to 200 girls during the life cycle of building the product.More from iCONIC: Amazon almost crushed me, and I'm not even a retailerHow you can make six figures working from your local coffee shop20-somethings would take less pay if they had these 5 job perksJewelbots bracelets can pair up with nearby bracelets and be set to turn a certain color when friends are nearby. They can also send messages back and forth between paired bracelets and can be coded to change colors with open-source software, to expose users to coding in a fun and simple way.The friendship bracelets are equipped with four LED lights and a button and connect with one another over Bluetooth. To test the idea for Jewelbots, they launched a Kickstarter campaign in July 2015, hoping to raise $30,000 in 30 days. Instead, they hit that goal in 24 hours and went on to sell 3,000 bracelets and raise $170,000 in just one month.""It was a great way for us to show, in a short period of time, that this is something people want and are willing to pay for before it even exists,"" Moreland said.From there, they set their sights on Techstars in New York City, knowing the pitch may be a long shot. But they were accepted, and the co-founders graduated the elite accelerator program in December 2015. They've gone on to raise $1.3 million from angels and venture capital investors, including Techstars, Homebrew and Brand Foundry Ventures.Chipps and Moreland also pitched a contact at Target, getting placed on Target.com in November 2016 in time for the holiday rush. To date, 7,000 Jewelbots have been sold in 35 countries, retailing at $69 for one bracelet or $99 for a two-pack. They're also working on international distribution ahead of this holiday season, trying to spread their message far and wide.""Right now the toys we make for girls are consumables, and the toys we make for boys teach them to be builders, inventors and creators,"" Chipps said. ""We teach girls to be caretakers.

The company invited Singh and several other health developers in the space to participate in its upcoming Alexa Diabetes Challenge, which comes with a $125,000 grand prize sponsored by drug maker Merck.The goal is to get developers to build apps that use Amazon's Alexa voice-recognition software to help people with diabetes manage the disease. ""Communicating through voice, rather than just on a screen, has the potential to empower patients to change habits and improve their overall wellbeing,"" a blog post reads.Glooko ended up submitting an app that would act as a personal health assistant for people with Type 2 diabetes. Alexa would ask basic questions on a daily basis, like ""What have you eaten today?"" or ""Did you take your meds today"" and set up a weekly call with a health coach.Diabetes is a particularly popular initial target for technology companies, including Alphabet and Apple, as the disease is expensive to manage and requires varying degrees of tracking, among other reasons. Apple is working on a novel sensor that can continuously and non-invasively track glucose, while Alphabet is developing a contact lens to track blood sugar without pricking the skin and has secured partnerships with life sciences companies like Sanofi and Dexcom. ""We've heard a lot from Apple and Google, especially about hardware,"" Singh told CNBC. ""We were more surprised to hear from Amazon.""Diabetes isn't the only opportunity for health developers intrigued by voice-recognition software. Boston Children's Hospital developed its own Alexa-based app called KidsMD that issues advice to parents when their kids catch a fever.""From a business-model perspective, I think that Amazon Alexa could do a lot to bring their Echo devices into the enterprise chronic-care management space,"" said Singh.

461,The Nasdaq 100 is on pace to do something it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t since the tech bubble,Trading Nation,02-06-2017,"VIDEO3:2703:27Nasdaq 100 outperforming Russell 2000 by huge marginTrading NationIt's been a great year for big tech stocks, and a pretty meager one for the small caps; the Nasdaq 100 index is up 20 percent this year, while the Russell 2000 has risen by less than 3 percent, through Thursday's close. If that pace continues, 2017 will witness the greatest outperformance for the Nasdaq 100 as compared to the Russell 2000 since 1999.To be sure, even if the Nasdaq 100 does beat the Russell 2000 by 40 percent this year, that will still only represent half of the staggering, 82 percent outperformance seen in 1999, when the Nasdaq 100 more than doubled in value. That came on the back of an 85 percent rise for the Nasdaq in 1998, a year in which the Russell actually dropped.This year, the disparate performances for the two indices can be pegged largely on the huge surge seen in a few big tech stocks, as well as the more general matter of sector mix.Just five companies now make up more than 40 percent of the Nasdaq 100: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, and Alphabet. All have performed exceptionally this year. In fact, Piper Jaffray technical analyst Craig Johnson found that without the so-called ""FANG"" stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet) the Nasdaq would have advanced just 13 percent this year. And this 13 percent figure includes the large contribution of Apple, which is the largest component and has gained about 33 percent this year.The outperformance of the big-tech-fueled Nasdaq 100 could speak to ""this winner-take-all economy that we're in, where a few large companies are getting a bigger and bigger share of the profit pie,"" said Boris Schlossberg of BK Asset Management.""This is actually not a good thing for the economy or for the society as a whole,"" Schlossberg said Thursday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""At the same time, sector performance has been a large factor as well. The Nasdaq 100 is 58 percent information technology, 22 percent consumer discretionary, and 10 percent healthcare; of that consumer discretionary piece, nearly half is made up by Amazon, Priceline, Netflix and Tesla, which might be broadly characterized as tech stocks.Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 is just 18 percent information technology. Financials are the heavyweight, with a 19 percent weighting, and industrials make up 14 percent of the index. So far this year, the information technology sector is the big market leader followed by consumer discretionary, and financials have lagged far behind.For Schlossberg, there's a political flavor to this sector story.""The Russell [is showing] disappointment in the Trump trade, in the sense that a lot of people were waiting for a lot of things to help small businesses \xe2\x80\x94 tax policy, regulatory policy \xe2\x80\x94 and none of that has really come through,"" the strategist said.After all, the small-cap index surged following Donald Trump's election. Financials and industrials were supposed to be serious beneficiaries of his regulation-slashing, infrastructure-building policies. And more generally, trade-protectionist policies were supposed to harm large multinational companies while perhaps helping small domestic ones.With little having been done in Washington, that trade has dramatically turned around. Meanwhile, hopes for lower taxes on repatriated money is good for tech companies hoarding money overseas.The fact that tech has led so dramatically, meanwhile, is not a good thing in Johnson's book.""As a technician, I want to see the rest of the market kick in before we can really make that big leg higher in the overall market,"" Johnson said.Despite this year's trend, the Russell is enjoying a good start to Friday, following an impressive Thursday performance.

Elon Musk, for example, has announced he is leaving the presidential councils he sat on as an advisor to Trump. ""Climate change is real,"" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO said in a tweet. ""Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.""  Sutton, for his part, sits on the president's Manufacturing Jobs Initiative council.""I do think the president is listening, I do think he's trying to manage a lot of different issues for a lot of different constituents,"" he told CNBC at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum when asked about the climate deal and Trump's stance on global trade.VIDEO4:0104:01Reducing environmental footprint is business as usual: International Paper CEOSquawk Box Europe""So I'm still engaged and think that the business community has a role to play in improving the economy in the U.S. and, for a company like International Paper, the economy globally.""

""I think for a company like International Paper, reducing our environmental footprint's long been part of our goals and objectives, and nothing really changes for us,"" he said. ""We've made commitments publicly and we're working on those commitments, not only on greenhouse gases but water and other environmental implications,"" he added.Sutton said that reducing the company's environmental footprint was the right thing to do, ""for our company, our customers, and the other stakeholders in our company.""MomentumVIDEO3:4703:47Trump's withdrawal from Paris pact will not change US momentum towards sustainability: CEOSquawk Box EuropeDespite Trump's announcement drawing criticism from many, Jean-Pascal Tricoire, chairman and CEO of energy management and automation specialist Schneider Electric, remained upbeat.""I spend a lot of time in the U.S., which is our largest market,"" he said.

""When you meet cities, when you meet companies today, when you meet the states where a lot of those decisions have been made, people are committed to reduce carbon emissions.""

The 737 MAX 9, which can carry up to 220 passengers, is the second of three variants of the popular single-aisle model.Getty ImagesFor Norwegian Air, taking delivery of its new Boeing 737 MAX 8 is another great marketing opportunity. It's offering a dozen people a once-in-a-lifetime ride on the airline's newest plane. But just four days after opening an auction for seats on the delivery flight scheduled for June 13, Norwegian says it won't be taking off that day.""Boeing has informed us that the delivery of our first 737 MAX is postponed until the end of June,"" the company said in a brief statement. Why the delay?Boeing spokesman Doug Alder tells CNBC: ""On occasion delivery processes run into minor issues \xe2\x80\x94 whether for maintenance or other reasons. In this case, we and our customer decided to re-schedule this delivery in order to resolve a minor technical issue.""Alder declined to give further details about issues causing the delay. Boeing expects Norwegian Air to get the plane by the end of June.  Pushing back scheduled deliveries of new planes is not unusual, but Boeing has a lot riding on its new 737. The transition from the current 737 NG to the 737 MAX is being watched closely. Boeing is currently building 42 737s each month, with monthly production scheduled to jump to 47 later this year, 52 in 2018 and 59 in 2019. As that production climbs, so will deliveries of the 737 MAX. There's no indication that delaying some initial 737 Max deliveries will jeopardize Boeing's production plans, but pushing back Norwegian's delivery comes less than a month after Boeing suspended 737 MAX test flights to inspect some of the engines for a potential manufacturing flaw. After inspecting the LEAP 1B engines and working with the engine manufacturer CFM International, Boeing resumed test flights, and the first 737 MAX 8 was delivered in mid-May to the Asian carrier Malindo Air. Malindo is now operating two 737 MAX planes.As for Norwegian, the delivery delay will not change the airline's plan to expand service to the U.S. this summer. ""This will not affect our operation or our passengers, as the upcoming launch of transatlantic routes between the U.S. East Coast and Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Norway will be operated by another aircraft type,"" the airline said.

Trump on Thursday announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate-change accords, and if he holds to his decision, he'll do the American people a great service.Simply put, before any president attempts to bind the United States to an enduring multinational accord, it's his duty to convince the American people \xe2\x80\x94 through constitutional processes \xe2\x80\x94 that the agreement is in the best interests of the United States.Barack Obama failed to do this in 2015. Trump is right to reject his actions today. More from National Review: 'Pressure' is not obstructionThe Left's unhinged freakout over Trump's Paris Accord withdrawalHillary blames America firstFirst, let's dispense with any notion that climate change is too important to be left to constitutional treaty-making process. If the consequences of climate change will be as catastrophic as alarmists fear, then the constitutional process becomes more important, not less.The constitutional process creates binding obligations that are based in broad consensus. If two-thirds of senators vote to ratify a treaty, then that effectively means that a supermajority of the American people either agree or acquiesce to the nation's commitment. It provides the basis for national action in response.  It's important to note that effective treaties bind not just the United States but all the signatories. Nonbinding pacts like the Paris Agreement, by contrast, are easily fractured and easily exploited.By definition, violating ""voluntary"" arrangements doesn't breach international law, and the result is an international arrangement that will exist precisely as long as any country believes it remains in their best interests \xe2\x80\x94 and no longer. It's inherently unstable.American presidents have gotten into the disturbing habit of discarding constitutional process when they find it inconvenient.\xc2\xa0Moreover, there's an important cultural value in following the Constitution. The treaty process places the burden of persuasion on American politicians. It's one thing to name-call and jeer at ""climate deniers"" when you can impose your will through a mere 51 percent of the Electoral College.It's another thing entirely to try to build a two-thirds consensus, a consensus that would necessarily have to unite large sectors of red and blue. The process of persuasion can have a positive effect on political discourse, requiring politicians to address voters concerns not merely dismiss dissenters as rubes and know-nothings.  Contrast the Paris accords with a true international treaty \xe2\x80\x94 like the North Atlantic alliance. For more than three generations, the U.S. has committed blood and treasure to its European allies, acting under full constitutional authority while receiving the binding reciprocal commitment of its partners to commit their own blood and treasure to the United States.Indeed they've done so in Afghanistan and continue to fight with us today. That's how you build an ""international community,"" not through executive agreements that can be unmade just as easily as they're made.American presidents have gotten into the disturbing habit of discarding constitutional process when they find it inconvenient. Barack Obama did it when he agreed to the Paris accords, when he negotiated the Iran nuclear deal, and when he launched a war against Libya without congressional approval.Trump did the same earlier this year when he launched a new military action against the Syrian regime, also without congressional approval. But just as presidents must be challenged when they violate the Constitution, they should be applauded when they respect its terms.It should surprise no one that following the Constitution also works to defend American economic interests. Even if much or most of recent planetary warming has human causes, that still doesn't mean the benefits of reducing emissions will always outweigh the costs. Not even the most radical environmentalists are willing to ""bear any burden, pay any price"" to halt warming.Moreover, that calculus can change depending on the economic conditions of the country. Clean-power regulations that might cost jobs or dramatically increase costs, for example, are one thing when jobs are plentiful and incomes are rising. They're another thing entirely in hard economic times. A nation should have the liberty to respond to the needs of its population.The calculus is simple. Binding, enduring multinational agreements should exist as treaties, as without a treaty there is no binding, enduring multinational agreement.Despite what you may read on Twitter or elsewhere online, don't believe for a moment that this is an apocalyptic moment. Private-sector innovation continues.American states have a degree of freedom to go their own way (and Americans have the freedom to move to \xe2\x80\x94 or away from \xe2\x80\x94 states that impose their own climate regulations), and if people truly believe the apocalypse looms, they have the ability to make that case to the America people.In his announcement today, Trump pledged to negotiate a different, better deal for American workers. If and when he does, he should depart from the Obama precedent, remember the Constitution, and submit that agreement for Senate ratification. Then he can perhaps build an enduring consensus. Then he can lead the free world the right way, by following the rule of law and hundreds of years of international legal norms.The calculus is simple. Binding, enduring multinational agreements should exist as treaties, as without a treaty there is no binding, enduring multinational agreement.Trump has been hit-or-miss on his campaign promises. Just today he wrongly backed away from his commitment to move America's embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. But leaving the Paris agreement was a big promise made, and as of today it's a big promise kept.Commentary by David French, a senior fellow at the National Review Institute and senior writer at National Review.

More specifically, the stock made me waver,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""The darned thing is so darned volatile that it's very hard to game even when you get the darned story right.""The athletic apparel retailer's previous quarter did not serve it so well. The company missed estimates and its stock plunged from $66 to $50 in a single session.""Look, I've like Lululemon for years, but lately I've been trying to pull back from the stories I like if their stocks are capable of being too toxic,"" Cramer said. ""The fact is, there are very few investors who are capable of taking that kind of near-term pain to get some level of gain in the future.""Watch the full segment here:VIDEO6:3606:36Cramer: With the stock of Lululemon, it's no pain, no gainMad Money with Jim CramerAnd Cramer got worried after the company's last report. It botched the numbers so badly that it made the ""Mad Money"" host think that it was not just a momentary slip-up, but a larger issue entrenched in the highly competitive apparel retail space.After Lululemon's latest report, however, Cramer learned three things, the first of which was that last quarter's problem truly did have its roots in the company's execution.""Three months ago, the company told us that the last month of the disappointing quarter had been a strong one and it came in with a full head of steam, and that turned out to be true,"" he acknowledged.Second, the introduction of new styles and colors to Lululemon's racks served the company well, driving sales higher.Third, the company got a handle on its past supply chain problems and continued its global expansion, with demand in China red-hot.""[The] $1600 per square foot of sales out of China? That's breathtaking, and a further testimony to my initial belief that there's much more to this company than just bricks and mortar,"" Cramer said. ""You don't get a more than 200-basis-point expansion in margins, a need for more stores quickly because of worldwide demand, and 39 percent same-store sales in some of their items of clothes unless things really are smoking.""Still, even as Lululemon's numbers justify the strength of the company, its stock behaves frantically, almost separate from the retailer's fundamentals.And when it comes to Cramer's standing on the stock, he can see both its favorable and unfavorable prospects.""If you put a gun to my head ... I would've paid 25 times earnings. And sure enough, that gets you to $57, which is pretty much where it is. But on the trading desk? I probably would've said I ain't playing. Why? Because the risk from being wrong turned out to be much bigger than the reward from being right,"" he said.""So if you can't help yourself, I could justify buying Lululemon under $57, but honestly, here's where I really come out: very, very good company, but the stock, it sure ain't for the squeamish,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.In response to Cramer's analysis, Lululemon CEO Laurent Potdevin told CNBC in an email that his company is always evolving and refining its strategy.""Today, Lululemon is a very different organization than it was three years ago,"" he said. ""We've articulated a clear strategic 2020 growth plan to double revenue to $4 billion and more than double earnings.

474,Here's what to expect from Apple\xe2\x80\x99s big event Monday,Tech Guide,02-06-2017,"VIDEO1:1501:15Here's what to expect from Apple's big event next weekNews Videos's going to have a lot of big news to share Monday.The company's developer conference, known as WWDC, kicks off with a keynote at 10 a.m. PST, when we expect Apple to discuss new hardware and software.This is the time of year when Apple typically unveils new software that will power its upcoming Macs, iPhones and iPads \xe2\x80\x94 but we may also get a taste of new products we've never seen before.iOS 11 and macOSIt's almost a certain that Apple will reveal its new iOS 11 operating system ahead of its new iPhone launch later this fall. The tech giant typically unveils the fresh version of iOS during WWDC and then runs it through developer testing to around September when it pushes it out for everyone to use. Little is known about what Apple will include in iOS 11, but we're hoping to see improvements to Siri, which has started to lag behind competitors like Google Assistant and even Amazon Alexa.Apple will also likely unveil the next version of macOS. The current version, macOS Sierra, was introduced last year when Apple officially departed from the ""OS X"" moniker for its operating system. Again, like iOS 11, we're not quite sure what to expect in terms of new features just yet. I hope to at least see Siri play an even deeper role in the desktop operating system, too, with more new controls that could make it easier to manage your Mac with voice.Those two, the iOS and macOS updates, are the safest bets. Now let's talk a bit about hardware, which may or may not happen.MacBook and MacBook Pro refreshesApple's MacBooks are overdue for a refresh to Intel's latest seventh-generation processors, which are already in machines from PC makers. We should see Apple update the MacBook Pro, the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and the thin-and-light MacBook with the new chips, Bloomberg said earlier this month.We might even see the MacBook Air updated with the new chips, though that computer is showing its age with an old display and ports that aren't as fast as newer ones. Apple may just kill it off entirely.Also, Apple's iMac and Mac Pro desktop computers are desperately in need of a refresh. Apple has said it'll refresh the Mac Pro, but I don't think we'll see it next week.New 10.5-inch iPad Pro and refreshed 12.9-inch iPad ProSupply chain reports have long suggested Apple is working to build a 10.5-inch iPad Pro that would replace the existing 9.7-inch iPad Pro. It's the first time Apple has ever launched a 10.5-inch iPad Pro, so we'll be curious to hear what the company's argument is for boosting the size. Apple is also expected to announce a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro, replacing last year's model. Expect more powerful graphics, faster processors and maybe even redesigns where the screen takes up more space on the front of the iPad. I wouldn't be surprised if Apple talked about the Apple Pencil, too, perhaps with a refresh to a newer model.A Siri smart speakerThe big news could be Apple's entrance into the smart home assistant market. Bloomberg said earlier this week that Apple may unveil a new smart home speaker that's powered by Siri and will compete with  Home and  Alexa. The speaker will reportedly offer surround-sound effects and better audio than the Echo or Home, which suggests it may also be more expensive. Part of me is hoping it'll sound as good as a Sonos Play:1 speaker. Unlike Google and Amazon, however, Siri doesn't really allow for ordering of goods or support for playing tunes through third-party music applications like Spotify. I'm curious to see how Apple will position this if it's locked down to the Apple ecosystem of products, like Apple Music.tvOS, webOS, watchOS, HomeKit and HealthKitGiven the software focus of a developer conference, Apple may dive into a variety of other topics including its smart home platform HomeKit, its health platform HealthKit, tvOS for the Apple TV, watchOS for the Apple Watch and maybe a bit on Apple CarPlay. Speaking of the Apple TV, Apple has been reportedly trying to establish streaming TV deals for a while now, but I'd be surprised if anything came to fruition next week. Finally, my guess is we'll hear a bit more about original content, like Apple's first shows ""Carpool Karaoke"" and ""Planet of the Apps.""No iPhonesFinally, if you're hoping for new iPhones, you'll need to wait a few more months. Apple will probably stick to its regular schedule of launching new iPhones in September.WATCH: CNBC puts the first-generation iPhone to the testVIDEO1:3501:35CNBC puts the first-generation iPhone to the testTech Drivers",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/what-to-expect-from-wwdc--new-ipads-macbooks-ios-11-and-more.html

The latest cast of key characters, headed by U.S. President Donald Trump and Saudi's King Salman, has established a warmer rapport than seen during the final years of former President Barack Obama's presidency when tensions developed over Saudi Arabia's stance on Iran and Yemen.Yet cooperative links are now flourishing between the kingdom and Russia \xe2\x80\x93 the U.S.'s longstanding foe.The flagship symbol of cooperation is the oil output cut agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC members, originally brokered and recently extended thanks largely to the determined efforts of Saudi Arabian and Russian representatives.OPEC President Mohammed Barkindo told CNBC on Thursday from St. Petersburg that there was no doubt the ""turning point"" for the deal was when both countries decided to come together in China last year to sign a statement of cooperation that was ""widely acclaimed"".""For them to decide to come together to address the challenges of the market \xe2\x80\xa6 I think it is a welcome development by all producing countries,"" he asserted, adding that just this week both sides had reiterated their joint determination to work together to ensure that the oil market's volatility is tackled.VIDEO2:5302:53Trump defends climate decision based on jobs and economySquawk BoxKirill Dmitriev, chief executive officer (CEO) of the sovereign wealth fund the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), also hailed the deal as ""historic"", in a conversation with CNBC on Friday.""It's the first time Saudi Arabia and Russia are working together very well on the international stage,"" he explained.In other signs of tightening relations, Friday morning alone saw Russia's largest oil producer, Rosneft, and Saudi Arabia's national oil company Saudi Aramco announce that they will look into joint investments in the kingdom with another Russian gas giant Lukoil also revealing that it will consider marketing oil alongside Saudi Aramco. That same morning, Saudi Arabia confirmed it would evaluate the possibility of joining Russia's arctic liquid natural gas (LNG) project.VIDEO3:2403:24Essential that there is no compromise on the future of the planet: ProSquawk Box EuropeThese developments followed news late Thursday that Trump had decided to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate change agreement with many commentators questioning the broader and longer-term implications of the U.S. stepping back from its leadership role in this pivotal international agreement.The decision does not just reflect a retreat from leadership but a more widespread inability and unwillingness of countries to compromise, according to Vladimir Yakunin, former Russian Railways president and current chairman of the DOC Research Institute, a German think tank.Speaking to CNBC from St. Petersburg on Friday, Yakunin said he expects this to result in a turmoil-ridden time ahead for world economies. He also predicted that trends showing the rise in power of Eastern countries alongside a decline in the West's strength would persist, as data continue to show the rapid relative economic growth in Asia.""At the G-20 for example, reputable experts, they are talking about values, they are talking about the shifting of economic engines towards East, towards Asia, that is a fact \xe2\x80\xa6 It's not possible just to close eyes and to see it and to think 'we Russians are the best' or 'we Americans are the best' or 'we Europeans are the best' \xe2\x80\x93 look at the figures,"" he argued.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

478,Emergency rooms can be incredibly unfair to the poorest patients,Hospitals,02-06-2017,"Sam Edwards | Caiaimage | Getty ImagesImagine you're rushed into an emergency room with a heart problem. The doctor says you need an electrocardiogram to check your heartbeat. You ask about the price \xe2\x80\x94 and no one can give it to you.Turns out you might end up paying anywhere between $18 and $317 for the test, depending on the hospital and your insurance. And if you happen to be uninsured or a minority patient, you're more likely to end up getting dinged with a higher hospital bill.Welcome to the arcane and arbitrary world of billing practices at US hospitals today, as detailed in a  new JAMA Internal Medicine study. The researchers, from the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, uncovered wild variation in the charging practices of hospital emergency rooms, and found that vulnerable patients \xe2\x80\x94 uninsured people, minority groups \xe2\x80\x94 are more likely to be hit with the highest bills.More from Vox:  An incredibly telling thing Trump said at today's Paris event wasn't about climate at allThe 5 biggest deceptions in Trump's Paris climate speechTrump administration to Supreme Court: give us the travel ban now, rule on it laterThese charging practices aren't the result of evil schemes on the part of hospital billing departments. Instead, they're set by hospital ""chargemasters"" \xe2\x80\x94 computer software that adjusts the prices for hospital services with the goal of hitting certain profit targets. The prices are based on expected collection rates, and tend to fluctuate day to day. They're also pretty random, the researchers found, but trend toward minorities and the uninsured getting gouged the most.Hospitals charge on average 340 percent more than what Medicare will pay for servicesFew people pay the total amount on a hospital bill because most of us have some form of insurance that covers the costs minus a negotiated discount that's worked out between the hospital and the insurance company.But people who wind up in hospitals without insurance, or at hospitals outside their insurance network, don't have the benefit of that discount. That means patients end up getting stuck with the sticker price.""These people are sometimes the victims of price gouging in a marketplace that lacks a lot of transparency,"" said Martin Makary, a professor of surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the study's senior investigator.In the study, the researchers dove into Medicare billing records for 12,000 emergency medicine doctors working at 300 hospitals in all 50 states. They examined the bills emergency rooms were producing and compared them with what Medicare was paying for the same services. (They assumed that if hospitals would accept Medicare patients and the prices their coverage will pay for, then those prices must be adequate to cover the cost of services.) They also parsed the characteristics of the populations the hospitals were serving and whether they were run as for-profit ventures, along with other features.The markups they discovered were staggering. Overall, patients were being charged 340 percent more than what Medicare pays, meaning emergency medicine physicians bill $4 billion overall for the same services Medicare would pay only $898 million for. The markups ranged anywhere from $100 to $12,600 per service, depending on the hospital, with an average markup of $420.For a doctor's interpretation of electrocardiograms, Medicare typically paid $16, while different emergency departments typically charged $95 on average. Yet a patient could be charged anywhere from $18 to $317, the researchers wrote. Laceration repairs had the highest average price markup, while the cost of interpreting CT scans varied the most across the country.For-profit hospitals, and those located in the Southeastern and Midwestern US, charged the most in their emergency departments.Most damning, though, the highest price markups were happening in emergency departments that served larger uninsured and African-American and Hispanic populations. One potential reason, the researchers wrote: These hospitals sometimes have a high proportion of costs they have to eat because lower-income patients can't pay their bills \xe2\x80\x94 so they may be trying to make up for those losses by increasing the hospital charges.Hospital price gouging is part of America's health care cost crisis \xe2\x80\x94 but there are ways to avoid itPart of the health care cost crisis in America is high drug prices. Another part of it is inappropriate or excessive care. There's also the administrative burden health providers face dealing with multiple insurance payers. ""But part of it is actually a practice that we refer to as price gouging,"" Makary said. And charging 340 percent over the Medicare allowable rate is price gouging.""One of the biggest problems in health care today is the cost crisis,"" he added. ""With increased attention on insurance premiums, it's important to understand that when insurance companies are overcharged, those excess costs get passed on in the form of higher premiums the following cycle.""Makary wants people to know that emergency room prices vary. He urges patient to contest hospital bills by asking for discounts using a few approaches: Patients can ask to pay the Medicare allowable rate, the same rate as an in-network person would pay (if you're paying out of pocket), or ask for an itemized bill to ensure all the services rendered were necessary. Patients can also contest any contract if they were required to sign it at a point of distress. Elisabeth Rosenthal, the author of the new book An American Sickness, about the cost of American health care, also suggests avoiding a private room, refusing unnecessary equipment, and identifying the people who come by your bedside and writing down who they are (or asking a family member to).But to really fix the pricing problem, we need systems level change: Hospitals should start routinely disclosing what they charge, like every other market does, so patients aren't left operating blindly, Rosenthal told Vox in an  interview.""Patients and the doctors who treat them have to know what things cost, and hospitals and drugmakers have to be way more upfront about their charges,"" she said.

And so, over his own misgivings, he helped a friend working with western intelligence to pinpoint the location of an Isis jail in exchange for cash.Hassan, a lanky young man who asked that his real name not be used, warned his contact that the prison was likely to be full of detainees \xe2\x80\x94 innocents, kidnapped or jailed by the jihadi group. Days later, it was bombed.""I went back to yell at the guy,"" he recalls. ""But he just smiled and said, 'To do this work, you have to crush your heart and conscience beneath your boots'.""More from Financial Times: Chinese group Fortune Fountain Capital to buy Baccarat glasswareG7 allies lead anger at Trump's exit from Paris climate agreementBillionaire Anbang boss Wu Xiaohui barred from leaving ChinaThat was Hassan's jarring entrance to the murky world of informants who feed intelligence to the US-led coalition trying to defeat Isis. It is a job he continues to do \xe2\x80\x94 mostly out of need but partly, he says, because he hopes the more accurate the information he collects, the less often civilians will be killed in strikes.A cottage industry of intelligence gathering has mushroomed in the past six months, according to interviews with nine Syrians involved. The trend comes as questions are raised about rising civilian death tolls from coalition strikes. Last week, the Pentagon acknowledged that 105 civilians were killed by coalition bombs in the Iraqi city of Mosul in March; residents in Raqqa say more than 30 were killed at a school sheltering families displaced by war the same month.Despite conflicted feelings \xe2\x80\x94 and sometimes outright disdain toward an American-run alliance \xe2\x80\x94 more Syrians who fled Isis have turned to this work as US-backed ground forces move to capture Mosul and Raqqa, the crown jewels of Isis's self-proclaimed ""caliphate"".VIDEO5:5805:58EU is not as such a military player on Syria: EU's foreign policy chiefSquawk Box Europe""Everyone is now emboldened to work for the coalition. Why? Because people are tired. Some are desperately poor, others just want this to be over,"" says another informant. ""We even have Isis guys \xe2\x80\x94 some of them commanders \xe2\x80\x94 working with us. They see Isis being defeated and don't want to die with it.""In spite of the number of civilians killed by coalition bombs, Syrians describe the stunning accuracy of the strikes. Two recalled an Isis commander whose apartment was struck with a missile, even as the floors below and above were untouched.But some blame the casualties on what they say is ""looser rules of engagement"" by US forces. Other informants also worry that the problem is their own intelligence, whose quality may have deteriorated when networks rapidly expanded as Isis comes under rising pressure and loses swaths of territory.Isis clamped down or banned the use of mobile phones and internet in areas it still controls, leaving informants scrambling for more sources. As the anti-Isis campaign escalates, informants' handlers \xe2\x80\x94 ranging from the US, the UK and France to Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates \xe2\x80\x94 are demanding more information, more quickly.""It has got messy. Before, it was more manageable and organised. We knew the timing when people could talk, we knew what kind of information we were going to discuss,"" says Youssef, another informant who asked that his real name not be used. ""These days, we don't know when people can get online or if they can at all.""One man, who leads a crew of informants, recalls lecturing a US contact over a strike that hit civilians. ""The Americans said, 'Yes, we hit it,'"" he says. ""'But who gave us the co-ordinates? We need to strike. If you give bad information, that's on you.'""Informants describe a three to four-layered network of interlinked cells. It starts with Syrians inside Isis territory and stretches across the border into southern Turkey. Some cross-check the information, including co-ordinates and photographs, and pass it on to a team leader, who deals directly with a foreign intelligence contact.Some informants suspect their network leaders, motivated by greed or growing demand, are selling the same intelligence to multiple coalition countries, which could make uncertain information appear sounder than it is.One team leader's subordinates calculated their boss makes $5,000 a month from one coalition government. Those in the two middle layers, also based in Turkey, make between $500 and $2,000 a month. Sources on the ground \xe2\x80\x94 who face the biggest risk of being discovered and killed \xe2\x80\x94 earn just $100-$300 a month, with bonuses for high-value targets.All of those interviewed say their main task is tracing muhajireen, Arab or foreign fighters, and high-level emirs, or commanders. They report back any movement and details as simple as what someone ate or wore.The biggest prize is to hand over an emir's telephone number or that of one of his bodyguards. (Isis has repeatedly banned the use of phones to prevent fighters from being tracked or bugged, yet, apparently, many of its members continue to use them.)Informants say they communicate by WhatsApp, the messaging application, while their handlers meet in Turkish hotels to trade information. Sometimes foreign intelligence officers provide their teams with equipment but, just as often, informants buy it for themselves.Youssef says: ""We have so much information on local emirs, we know how many hairs they have on their backside. But muhajireen, that is difficult work.""But personal rivalries and revenge may compromise the quality of the information. One informant in Turkey says an Isis contact in Syria sent the number of a member of the group's Hisba, or morality police, with instructions to ""give him hell,"" raising his suspicions of personal vendetta.The concerns have caused some to claim they are seeking a way out of the business.""After all the betrayals and all the mistakes I've seen made, I no longer have faith in it,"" one informant says. ""Every day I see things that I think are wrong.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/spy-network-grows-as-war-on-isis-heats-up.html

Cheaper natural gas and renewable energy will be the primary culprit behind coal power plant closures for the next three to five years, he said. ""The trend of low gas prices and declining renewable costs are independent of expectations created by the CPP and will continue to affect coal-fired generation even in its absence."" More from NBC News:As Trump quits climate pact, states step inCasino robbery ends with dozens dead at resort in PhilippinesFact checking Trump's Paris agreement speech Over the long term, Venkataraman wrote that rolling back the CPP would slow \xe2\x80\x94 but not halt or reverse \xe2\x80\x94 the secular decline of coal. ""Many coal plants will need financial support to survive into the next decade given the sector's dire economics. There are no concrete proposals for such support at this time,"" he wrote.According to a January report published by regional utility operator ISO New England, ""Several factors are making it hard for coal- and oil-fired resources to recover the cost of capital investments to maintain their older plants."" Coal-fired plants contributed just 2 percent of the region's power in 2016, down from 18 percent in 2000.Renewables and natural gas power the nationAlthough ADP's report on job growth found that the private sector added 3,000 mining jobs in May, those New England statistics echo a similar decline nationwide: A decade ago, coal was responsible for about half of electricity generation, according to the American Action Forum, a figure that has fallen to around 30 percent, below the 33 percent natural gas now contributes. In that time frame, renewable energy (excluding hydropower) has ticked up from the low single digits to around 10 percent.Philip Rossetti, a data scientist at the American Action Forum, noted in an April report that coal's contribution to the nation's power needs dropped around the time of the Great Recession. Although it never recovered fully, its use in energy generation remained more or less steady even as a slate of new environmental regulations were introduced by the Obama administration.The pro-environmental Conservation Law Foundation called the closure ""a win,"" saying the ""outdated"" plant had subjected the region to ""roughly 50 years of spewing air, water, and carbon pollution.""David Onufer, spokesman for Brayton Point's parent Dynegy, said that the ""irreversible"" decision to close the plant was made in 2013, before Dynegy purchased it.""Low electricity prices and the high cost to maintain aging facilities led to the decision,"" he said. Of the roughly 170 employees at Brayton Point before the closure, Onufer said a small number would stay on to decommission the plant over the next two months, and Dynegy guaranteed an interview to any employee who wanted to apply for a job at another one of its facilities.""It was a very old plant,"" Rossetti said. ""Natural gas was getting cheaper [and] natural gas power plants are getting more efficient.""That growing efficiency is one reason why coal just can't keep up, an imbalance that is exacerbated by sustained low prices for natural gas. ""Economically, it was time to retire it,"" said James Stevenson, director, global coal at IHS Markit.No return to coal's heydayCheaper natural gas means gas-fired plants can produce electricity more cheaply \xe2\x80\x94 good news for people who want to crank the AC this summer, but bad news for coal-fired power plants that have to lower prices to compete. ""It's great for industry \xe2\x80\x94 it keeps U.S. industries affordable by keeping electricity low, but it does hurt the margins of power companies,"" Stevenson said.Coal-fired plants also take longer to build than their gas counterparts, and have such a long life that power companies might not want to run the risk that any single administration's policies would have the kind of longevity necessary to justify the capital expenditure.""You're playing a long game. You'd expect it to be operating for 50 to 60 years,"" Stevenson said.While regulations do play a role, experts say rolling back Obama-era regulations wouldn't have kept Brayton Point open. ""The big thing is they already paid the hundreds of millions to have retrofits put in,"" Stevenson said. ""There has been a regulatory story that hurt coal\xe2\x80\xa6 but for the most part that's baked in.""""The technologies to prevent the pollution that causes those problems have already been widely adopted,"" Rossetti pointed out, and energy companies would be unlikely to abandon those significant investments.

The solar, wind and bios. We're going to keep supporting that.

Trump said Thursday that the United States will withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement. The president also said he would start talks to re-enter the accord with what he called a more ""fair"" deal, but was immediately rebuked by several European governments.The decision sets the world's largest economy apart from almost all other nations on Earth, and moves in opposition to many large American companies, as well.Trump cannot technically pull out of the agreement until November 2019, and the U.S. must give a year's notice before it can withdraw, according to reports. So a withdrawal may not take effect until 2020, though mechanisms exist to possibly speed the process.Read more: Trump: US is withdrawing from Paris climate agreement but wants to renegotiateBig businesses \xe2\x80\x94 even energy companies \xe2\x80\x94 disapprove of Trump's decision to walk away from climate dealFact-checking the energy claims in Trump's Paris Agreement speechIt's not just China: Here's who could benefit from Trump's exit from the Paris deal",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/watch-scott-pruitt-speak-about-trumps-decision-to-scrap-paris-accord.html

Security Council blacklist more North Korean individuals and entities over the country's repeated ballistic missile launches.Russia's Interfax news agency quoted Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying Moscow was puzzled and alarmed by the U.S. decision to sanction a Russian citizen and firms over alleged connections to North Korea.He said Russia is preparing retaliatory measures, and that the sanctions would not help efforts to restore relations between Moscow and Washington, RIA news agency reported.The United States has struggled to slow North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, which has become a security priority given Pyongyang's vow to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.President Donald Trump at the G7 Taormina summit on the island of Sicily in Taormina, Italy on May 27, 2017.Mehmet Ali Ozcan | Anadolu Agency | Getty ImagesWashington has worked to step up both unilateral and international sanctions in an effort to cut off funds and supplies to the reclusive state.The measures announced by the U.S. Treasury on Thursday sanctioned Ardis-Bearings Llc, which it said is based in Moscow, and its director, Igor Aleksandrovich Michurin, for acting as a supplier to a North Korean trading company involved in the country's missile and weapons of mass destruction programs.Another Russian firm, Independent Petroleum Company, and a subsidiary were blacklisted for signing a contract to provide oil to North Korea and shipping over $1 million worth of petroleum products to North Korea, Treasury said.The head of Independent Petroleum, Eduard Khudainatov, was chief executive of Russia's largest oil producer Rosneft from 2010 to 2012 before Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed his close aide, Igor Sechin, to replace him.Khudainatov then became a Rosneft vice president and subsequently left Rosneft and took over the much smaller IPC, which produces about 40,000 barrels of oil per day, compared with more than four million barrels a day at Rosneft. IPC was set up in December 2012, according to filings.The Treasury also sanctioned a major North Korean zinc company, the Korea Zinc Industrial Group, and the Korea Computer Center, which it said is a state-run information technology research center that generates foreign currency for the North Korean government through programming and software development.The center is believed to have offices in Germany, China, Syria, India and the Middle East, Treasury said.A North Korean intelligence official, Kim Su-Kwang, was also sanctioned. The Treasury said he had worked undercover at a United Nations organization in Europe.The steps freeze any funds the individuals or companies may have in the United States, and bar Americans from dealing with them.The United States has been negotiating with China for five weeks on possible new U.N. sanctions and the 15-member U.N. Security Council body could vote on a draft resolution to add names to its targeted sanctions list as early as Friday, diplomats said.The Trump administration has been pressing Beijing to rein in North Korea, warning that all options are on the table if Pyongyang persists with its nuclear and missile development.Traditionally, the United States has negotiated new sanctions with China - North Korea's neighbor and only major ally - before involving the other 13 council members. Russian support would be needed for the approval of a new resolution.Any new names added to the U.N. blacklist would be subjected to a global asset freeze and travel ban.The Security Council first imposed sanctions on Pyongyang in 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs and has ratcheted up the measures in response to five nuclear tests and two long-range missile launches.North Korea is threatening a sixth nuclear test and has conducted repeated missile tests this year.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/us-sanctions-more-including-russians-over-north-korea-arms.html

The company missed a June 1 interest payment on its outstanding notes due in 2018, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Gymboree now has a 30-day grace period to make a belated payment, the Thursday SEC filing said. Even when the news is brighter, it isn't all good. Lululemon shares surged after the seller of athletic apparel outpaced Wall Street's earnings expectations, but it also unveiled plans to restructure its kids clothing line. Ivivva, the company's activewear brand for girls, will become a primarily online-only business, and all Ivivva-branded showrooms will be shut down, Lululemon said. ""While there is some demand for athleticwear for younger girls, the level and frequency of that demand is insufficient to support a network of expensive stores,"" GlobalData Retail managing director Neil Saunders said about the restructuring decision by Lululemon management.This has likely become a bigger issue over the past 12 months, Saunders said, ""as generalists have piled into the market \xe2\x80\x94 affording price sensitive and brand disloyal younger consumers more opportunity to shop around."" It's true, the market is becoming more and more competitive by the week, especially with  making moves and being rewarded. Jeff Bezos' behemoth is now rolling out physical book stores and grocery pick-up locations \xe2\x80\x94 really keeping retailers on their toes. Amid the new round of store closures and mounting retail job losses, Credit Suisse made a gloomy forecast, which predicts that some 20 to 25 percent of all malls over the next five years will close their doors for good as square footage losses mount and are expected to continue growing.E-commerce sales are now responsible for much of the retail sector's remaining growth, the firm said. With brick-and-mortar locations underperforming across many brands, digital players are gaining market share, Credit Suisse analyst Christian Buss explained in a note describing retail's ""tumultuous 12 months."" Four keys for a retailer's survival include real estate rationalization, an investment in e-commerce, transforming one's supply chain and maintaining a ""unique"" brand, Credit Suisse has suggested. Same-store sales \xe2\x80\x94 a metric closely watched by Wall Street for retail stocks \xe2\x80\x94 are up just 16 basis points in the first quarter, based on reports from 92 retailers thus far this year, Retail Metrics' Ken Perkins said in a note Thursday. This marks a tie for the worst quarter of comparable-sales growth since the Great Recession of 2008. And second-quarter comparable sales expectations don't look much better, he said. Excluding big-box retailer , the Street has forecast second-quarter comps to grow a minimal 20 basis points, according to Retail Metrics' survey. These numbers are far from healthy.Quarterly same-store sales growth\xc2\xa0Source: Retail Metrics Employment in retail is another glaring issue. On Friday, the Labor Department announced retailers shed 6,100 jobs in May. The majority of those cuts came from department stores and ""other general merchandise"" stores, but food-and-beverage stores also saw a large drop-off, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show. A recent study by investment advisory firm Cornerstone Capital Group found that a significant portion of retail jobs ""likely will be automated"" in the coming years, which could leave many more individuals in the retail workforce unemployed. About 16 million people, or 1 in 10 American workers, are employed in the retail industry.""Taken together, store closures and automation technology have the potential to accelerate job losses in retail,"" Cornerstone Capital said. ""Retailers are facing structural price and cost issues that impact profitability and create meaningful long-term uncertainty. These headwinds will likely increase the industry's propensity to automate, which would have significant impacts on existing labor."" As the first-quarter earnings season comes to a close, analysts and investors are keeping their eyes peeled for more news of store closures, bankruptcies, layoffs and slipping sales. ""Department stores established a somber outlook out of the gate in early May, but a number of retailers, including Wal-Mart, Costco, Wayfair, Five Below, Dollar General and Williams-Sonoma reminded us that retail still has a pulse despite today's ongoing pressure from Amazon,"" said Charles Grom, an analyst at Gordon Haskett, in a research note.

494,Trump is 'totally wrong' that renewable energy will lead to 'blackouts',Energy,02-06-2017,"Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump was ""totally wrong"" when he said shifting to renewable energy sources would starve parts of the country of electricity and plunge them into darkness, according to people who make a living studying energy.Trump issued his warning on Thursday after announcing he would pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement, an international effort to mitigate the effects of climate change. Relying on renewable energy sources, he claimed, would leave the country with too little power to accelerate economic growth \xe2\x80\x94 or even go about business as usual.""We need all forms of available American energy, or the country will be at grave risks of brownouts and blackouts,"" he said. ""Our businesses will come to a halt in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life.""I don't think any country would take what they do under that agreement to the point where their people are suffering ... Nobody was going to do that anyway.Ted Kurydirector of energy studies, UF's Warrington College of BusinessBut the University of Minnesota's Massoud Amin, who studies the electricity grid, said Trump is talking about problems that don't exist.""In a nutshell, with all due respect to the president's office, he is totally wrong,"" Amin told CNBC.""The challenges are not what President Trump is noticing,"" he said. ""The challenges are how to upgrade the transmission and distribution networks"" to make the U.S. electric grid flexible and resilient enough to accommodate renewable energy.Inadequacies in the U.S. electricity grid already cost the economy $80 billion annually, Amin concluded in a 2011 white paper.VIDEO2:5302:53Trump defends climate decision based on jobs and economySquawk BoxIf the White House wants to prevent blackouts, it should focus on improving the physical infrastructure of the grid, Amin said. His research shows that would improve national security, create jobs and cut carbon emissions.Utilities will still need to rely on other energy sources to provide electricity when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining, but power companies typically have reserve capacity equal to 15 to 20 percent of the total, said Ted Kury, director of energy studies at the University of Florida's Warrington College of Business.Where future energy will come from, according to the Department of EnergyMuch of the new capacity is coming from natural gas, which burns cleaner than coal and is replacing coal because it's cheaper.""An all-of-the-above strategy is important, but this idea that we're anywhere close to a point where renewable penetration in the country is endangering the grid \xe2\x80\x94 I don't think that's a valid concern,"" he told CNBC.Kury also noted that the Paris Agreement gives signatories a tremendous amount of flexibility and lacks mechanisms to punish countries that don't meet their targets.""I don't think any country would take what they do under that agreement to the point where their people are suffering,"" he said. ""So to me, [Trump's] statement is a bit of a straw man. Nobody was going to do that anyway.""The cost of boosting the gridMaking the grid stronger would require adding about 42,000 miles of high voltage wire to the country's existing 450,000 miles. That project would cost about $8.5 billion per year over 10 years but would generate up to 214,000 jobs, according to Amin.Integrating smart technology like sensors would cost $17 billion to $24 billion each year over 20 years.Those initiatives could be paid with the type of private-public investments Trump has endorsed and would allow the grid to draw up to half of all power from renewable sources, Amin said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/trump-is-totally-wrong-that-renewable-energy-will-lead-to-blackouts.html

And it was further said by these people that there would be no action required from Russia.""The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News.Fried declined to say who approached him, but ""I found the story sufficiently credible, that I was concerned that there might actually be something done quickly.""So Fried and another former diplomat, Tom Malinowski, who was assistant secretary of state for human rights, began lobbying Congress to pass legislation codifying the sanctions, Malinowski told NBC News. A bill has been introduced in the Senate, but it has not passed.The Trump team backed off, Malinowski said he believes, because officials came to see that lifting the sanctions would look terrible in light of the drumbeat of revelations over potential Trump campaign coordination with the Russian election interference effort.""It would be politically stinky,"" he said.Malinowski said he is now concerned that even if the Trump administration doesn't lift sanctions on Russia, it will stop vigilantly enforcing them. The U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control, which polices sanctions, does not have a permanent chief, and the State Department does not have a permanent sanctions coordinator.The Washington Post reported Thursday that the Trump administration is considering handing back to Russia two U.S. diplomatic compounds that the Obama administration seized as punishment for Russian election hacking.Russia has not changed its behavior in any substantive way to merit that or other sanctions relief, Malinowski said.""What was troubling about these stories is that suddenly I was hearing that we were preparing to rescind sanctions in exchange for, well, nothing,"" Fried said on MSNBC.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/former-diplomats-trump-team-sought-to-lift-sanctions-on-russia.html

The average work week was unchanged at 34.4 hours.""This report is clearly soft in every material respect relative to expectations and relative to last month. That's a disappointment,"" said Eric Winograd, U.S. economist at Alliance Bernstein. However, he added, ""I don't think it's soft enough to cause a fundamental rethink of the economic outlook.""In addition to the weak May numbers, previous months also saw significant downward revisions. March's weak 79,000 got sliced down to 50,000, while the April number declined to 174,000 from 211,000. Taken together, job growth has averaged just 121,000 over the past three months.Several economists said the May numbers in particular often are subject to seasonal quirks and come in low.""May has proven to be a difficult month for payrolls in recent years as spring hiring slows down and recent college graduates have yet to enter the labor force,"" Charlie Ripley, investment strategists for Allianz Investment Management, said in a note. ""While today's number disappointed, we cannot ignore the fact that labor market conditions (are) tight and finding available workers to fill positions is becoming more difficult.""Professional and business services led the way with 38,000 new positions, while health care added 24,000. Mining grew by 7,000 and bars and restaurants added 38,000. Retail lost 6,100 jobs and government dropped by 9,000.Job creation skewed toward lower-wage professions. Full-time jobs tumbled 367,000 for the month, while part-time positions rose by 133,000.The unemployment rate decline was due primarily to a fall in the labor force participation rate, which declined two-tenths to 62.7 percent and remained mired around its lowest levels since the late 1970s. The rate, though, is at its lowest level since May 2001.An alternative measure of joblessness that takes into account discouraged workers and the underemployed fell to 8.4 percent, its lowest reading since November 2007. The level of Americans counted as not in the labor force swelled to just below 95 million.After the first two months of the year indicated stronger growth in job creation, the latest reports indicate that President Donald Trump has a lot of work to do to generate the the 3 percent-plus growth he has promised.""The May report was a disappointment. Taken with the downward revisions, it suggests a continuation of the combination of slow GDP growth and weak productivity growth, emphasizing the need for structural reforms in tax, regulatory, and entitlement policies,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum.The report comes amid hopes that the U.S. economy will accelerate after an anemic first quarter that saw GDP increase just 1.2 percent. Trump has maintained that his pro-growth agenda will ignite an economy that has shown steady but slow growth since the end of the Great Recession.Federal Reserve policymakers are watching the jobs data closely, particularly for wage increases. The central bank is expected to continue on a path of periodic rate increases, but slowness in inflation could alter its plans.Despite the weakness, Winograd does not think the numbers will deter the Federal Reserve from going ahead with a rate hike in June and a continued slow path back to normalized policy.""The cumulative improvement of the labor market year-to-date is enough for them to move forward with the June hike,"" he said. ""There's still some evidence of slack that allows the FEd to go slowly or very slowly with rate hikes.""Economists had been looking for a stronger report today, particularly after ADP and Moody's Analytics said Thursday that private payrolls surged by 253,000 in May.As the market digested the report, expectations for a June Fed move remained high, with a 93.5 percent chance, but doubts remain about the rest of the year. The fed funds futures market was indicating just a 45.3 percent chance for another hike before 2017 ends, according to the CME.Friday's report ""really calls into question September and beyond,"" said Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab. ""If we don't get a turnaround, particularly in inflation, it's going to be tough for the Fed to keep raising rates.""Get the market reaction here.WATCH: Here's why working from home could make you miserableVIDEO1:3801:38Here's why working from home could make you miserableDigital Original",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/nonfarm-payrolls-may-2017.html

Siraj Khaliq, an ex-Googler and current partner at London-based venture capital fund Atomico, said European companies are taking a lead in so-called ""deep technology"" - which includes AI.AI assistants can provide alternatives and present tradeoffs while human asset managers ultimately decide the course of action.Hero Images | Getty Images""Never underestimate the value of innovation \xe2\x80\xa6 we will see some interesting companies coming out of Europe and the ambition level now exists to take those to those almost Google-scale outcomes, whereas perhaps there was more of a temptation to be acquired in the past,"" Khaliq told CNBC in a TV interview.  ""We are starting to see founders and backers with that patience to build truly longer term outcomes.""  Europe has been a hotbed of AI companies that have been eventually acquired by large U.S. technology giants. For example, Google acquired U.K. AI start-up DeepMind in 2014, which has now become an important part of its efforts with the technology, and Microsoft purchased British firm SwiftKey in 2016.  Khaliq said the fact that DeepMind is a British company and has most of its team still in London, is a ""clear example that the innovation is coming from Europe"".But at the same time, Europe has struggled to produce technology start-ups with valuations in the hundreds of billions of dollars.

Atomico has a large number of investments in Europe including companies such as Swedish payments firm Klarna, but also puts money into start-ups across the world.  Zenstrom echoed Khaliq's comments in an interview with CNBC in November.  ""We're confident in the next 10 years or so we will see companies from Europe that are on the scale of a Google or a Facebook,"" Zenstromm said.  Khaliq is also an entrepreneur and founded a company called The Climate Corporation, which used a branch of AI called machine learning to help farmers improve their crop yield. This was acquired by U.S. seed giant Monsanto in 2013 for around $1 billion, according to numerous media reports at the time.  He admitted that the U.S. has had a headstart in terms of venture capital firms funding companies, but that Europe is catching up.  ""I think we are a little late to the party here but we are catching up rapidly and some of the companies that are coming out of Europe now, they are innovators \xe2\x80\xa6 they are not copying anything that is happening elsewhere,"" Khaliq told CNBC.

The Cambridge, Massaschusetts-based research university published a study in April 2016 titled ""How much of a difference will the Paris Agreement make?"" showing that if countries abided by their pledges in the deal, global warming would slow by between 0.6 degree and 1.1 degrees Celsius by 2100.""We certainly do not support the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris agreement,"" said Erwan Monier, a lead researcher at the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, and one of the study's authors.VIDEO2:0602:06Possible Trump wants his own deal on climate change: ABN AmroSquawk Box Europe""If we don't do anything, we might shoot over 5 degrees or more and that would be catastrophic,"" said John Reilly, the co-director of the program, adding that MIT's scientists had had no contact with the White House and were not offered a chance to explain their work.The Paris accord, reached by nearly 200 countries in 2015, was meant to limit global warming to 2 degrees or less by 2100, mainly through country pledges to cut carbon dioxide and other emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.Under the pact, the United States - the world's second biggest carbon emitter behind China - had committed to reduce its emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.VIDEO1:2801:28Trump's Paris accord argument 'doesn't hold water'Street Signs AsiaA senior administration official defended Trump's use of the findings.

504,"Strong US job growth expected in May, but wage increase is seen moderate",Economy,02-06-2017,"A store front window in Miami Beach.Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesU.S. job growth likely remained strong in May, a further sign of an acceleration in economic activity that would effectively seal the case for an interest-rate increase this month despite sluggish wage gains.Nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 185,000 jobs last month, according to a Reuters survey of economists, after surging 211,000 in April. May's projected increase would be in line with this year's 185,000 average monthly job growth.The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at a 10-year low of 4.4 percent. It has dropped four-tenths of a percentage point this year. The Labor Department will release its closely watched employment report on Friday, less than two weeks before the Federal Reserve's June 13-14 policy meeting.""Another strong jobs report would help the Fed proceed with another rate hike at its June meeting, by supporting its contention that recent weakness in retail sales and inflation data will prove transitory,"" said Josh Wright, chief economist with recruitment software provider iCIMS in Matawan, New Jersey.U.S. financial markets have almost priced in a 25 basis points increase in the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate this month, according to CME FedWatch.VIDEO1:3201:32Can the US maintain a strong level of jobs growth in the near term? Experts weigh in. Minutes of the Fed's May 2-3 policy meeting, which were published last week, showed that while policymakers agreed they should hold off hiking rates until there was evidence the growth slowdown was transitory, ""most participants"" believed ""it would soon be appropriate"" to raise borrowing costs.The U.S. central bank raised interest rates by 25 basis points in March. Data on consumer spending and manufacturing suggest the economy gained speed early in the second quarter after gross domestic product increased at a tepid 1.2 percent annualized rate at the start of the year.The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP increasing at a 4.0 percent pace in the second quarter.But persistently sluggish wage growth could cast a shadow on further monetary policy tightening. Average hourly earnings are forecast rising 0.2 percent in May after gaining 0.3 percent in April.That would keep the year-on-year increase in wages at 2.5 percent. Average hourly earning could, however, surprise on the low side because of a calendar quirk.A soft average hourly earnings reading would come as annual inflation rates have retreated in recent months. But with the labor market expected to hit full employment this year, there is optimism that wage growth will accelerate.Skills shortageThere is growing anecdotal evidence of companies struggling to find qualified workers. The Fed in its Beige Book on Wednesday said a manufacturing firm in the Chicago district reported raising wages for unskilled laborers by 10 percent to attract better-quality workers and retain its workforce.The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.Republican President Donald Trump, who inherited a strong job market from the Obama administration, has vowed to sharply boost economic growth and further strengthen the labor market by slashing taxes and cutting regulation.There are, however, fears that political scandals could derail the Trump administration's economic agenda.VIDEO1:3201:32Low productivity in the US could explain the disconnect between employment and inflationThe labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, could have risen last month as college graduates enter the labor force. It has rebounded from a multi-decade low of 62.4 percent in September 2015 and economists see limited room for further gains as the pool of discouraged workers shrinks.""We suspect there is only limited scope for the prime age participation rate to keep rising,"" said Michael Pearce, a U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York. ""If that proves accurate, wage pressures are likely to build a little more rapidly over the coming years than over the past few.""Manufacturing employment likely increased, but payrolls in the automobile sector could decline amid falling sales. Ford Motor said last month it planned to cut 1,400 salaried jobs in North America and Asia through voluntary early retirement and other financial incentives.Further job gains are likely in construction.

506,Trump said to pick nominees for 2 positions on Fed board,Federal Reserve,02-06-2017,"Marriner S. Eccles Federal Reserve building in Washington, D.C.Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration has selected candidates for at least two of the three open positions on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, according to people with direct knowledge of the decision.The expected nominees include Randal K. Quarles, a Treasury Department official in the George W. Bush administration, and Marvin Goodfriend, a former Fed official who is now a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University. The name of the third nominee could not be confirmed.Read more from The New York Times:Jobs report leaves Fed room to raise ratesWe may be closer to full employment than it seemed. That's bad news.Rough treatment of journalists in the Trump eraIn picking Mr. Quarles and Mr. Goodfriend, President Trump is seeking to install conservative counterweights to the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen. Both men have expressed reservations about the Fed's aggressive efforts to revive economic growth since the 2008 crisis.Mr. Quarles would also become a leading figure in the administration's efforts to roll back financial regulation. He would be nominated to serve as the Fed's vice chairman for supervision, with responsibility for overseeing the Fed's regulatory responsibilities.It is not clear when the administration intends to announce the nominations, according to the people, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential conversations. Until that happens, it remains possible that Mr. Trump could decide to reopen the search process.Mr. Quarles and Mr. Goodfriend did not return calls requesting comment. ""We have no announcement at this time,"" said Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman.Mr. Quarles, 59, is a managing director at the Cynosure Group, a private equity firm based in Salt Lake City. His wife's great-uncle is Marriner Eccles, the Fed's chairman from 1934 to 1948 and the namesake of the Fed's marble headquarters on the National Mall in Washington, where Mr. Quarles would have an office.Mr. Quarles was a lawyer for the financial industry before joining the Bush administration in 2002, first as assistant secretary for international affairs and then as under secretary for domestic finance. After leaving the administration in 2006, he became a partner at the Carlyle Group before helping to found Cynosure in 2014.VIDEO4:3004:30Trump to Cabinet nominees: Be yourselfPower LunchAt the Fed, Mr. Quarles would take the place of Daniel Tarullo, who led the Fed's push to tighten financial regulation after the 2008 crisis, though he was never formally nominated to serve as the vice chairman for supervision.Mr. Quarles is regarded as significantly more sympathetic than Mr. Tarullo to the industry's concerns that regulation is overly restrictive, limiting economic growth.In a 2015 interview with Bloomberg Television, he said some postcrisis changes in regulation ""aren't well designed and were included for political rather than financial-regulatory reasons."" In a 2016 opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Quarles argued that  it was misguided to focus on the size of the largest banks.One of Mr. Quarles's major tasks at the Fed would be overseeing the annual ""stress test"" of large banks, intended to make sure that they can weather a crisis.But his influence would be constrained, at least in the short term, because Ms. Yellen played a key role in developing those regulations. Ms. Yellen's term ends in February 2018, creating the next Fed personnel decision confronting Mr. Trump. Mr. Goodfriend, 66, is a leading figure among conservative economists who study monetary policy. He worked for more than 20 years as an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond; for more than half of that time, he was the chief monetary policy adviser to the bank's president, a member of the Fed's policy committee.He left the bank in 2005 to join the faculty at Carnegie Mellon University.Mr. Quarles and Mr. Goodfriend have expressed support for the idea that the Federal Reserve should adopt a more formulaic approach to policy-making. House Republicans have proposed legislation that would require the Fed to articulate a policy rule \xe2\x80\x94 a mathematical approach to determining the level of interest rates \xe2\x80\x94 that would limit the role of human judgment in monetary policy.""If you're going to be transparent in an activity like the Fed, you have to be much more rule-based in what you're doing,""  Mr. Quarles told Bloomberg Television in 2015. He described the Fed's current approach as ""a crazy way to run a railroad.""Mr. Goodfriend endorsed that approach  in March testimony before the House Financial Services Committee. He said adopting such a rule was necessary ""to improve the discipline"" of monetary policy and constrain inflation.Mr. Goodfriend is also a critic of the Fed's asset purchases in the wake of the financial crisis. The Fed amassed more than $4 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Mr. Goodfriend has said that the Fed should not purchase mortgage bonds, because doing so promotes economic growth in a particular sector \xe2\x80\x94 the kind of judgment that should be left to those who determine fiscal policy.The Fed has operated in recent years without a full complement of seven governors. The board oversees regulatory policy, and the governors also hold permanent votes on the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy.By law, the Fed's board must include at least one person with community banking experience, and two of the people with direct knowledge of the process said that a number of candidates with that background have been interviewed in recent weeks. It is not clear, however, where a decision on filling the community-banking governor opening now stands.Watch: Fed's Harper says job creation still strongVIDEO1:1301:13Harker: Job creation is still strongHalftime Report",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/trump-said-to-pick-nominees-for-2-positions-on-fed-board.html

508,"Uber says it just noticed error on pay, but it was no secret",Tech,02-06-2017,"Uber drivers protest the company's recent fare cuts and go on strike in front of the car service's New York offices on February 1, 2016.Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesUber said last week that it had recently discovered an accounting error that had deprived New York drivers of tens of millions of dollars, and vowed to pay back drivers every cent, with interest.Now evidence has emerged suggesting that Uber and New York State regulators were aware of the improper deductions from drivers' earnings as early as 2015.The error involved Uber's taking its commission on fares that included sales tax, rather than on the pretax portion of the fare. If, for instance, a passenger paid $20 for a ride, and if taxes accounted for roughly $2 of that fare, Uber took its commission on the entire $20, rather than on $18.When admitting the error last week, Uber officials said they had discovered the problem only a few weeks earlier, as the company was updating its contract.But changes that Uber made to its contract in 2015 suggest that the company has been aware of the issue and grappling with it since at least that year.In an update to its contract in November 2014, Uber said that it would levy its commission on the pretax or ""net"" fare. If cities or other jurisdictions ""require taxes to be imputed in the fare, Uber shall calculate the service fee based on the fare net of such taxes,"" the contract stipulated.In December 2015, however, Uber changed this portion of the contract, replacing the phrase ""imputed in the fare"" with the phrase ""calculated on the fare."" The new wording, while ambiguous, lent itself more strongly to an interpretation that the fare did not include taxes.That appeared to address the problem that Uber admitted to last week: computing a commission on a tax-inclusive fare. But whatever legal cover that might have provided, the company did not change its practices until now, continuing to base its commission on the full fare while telling passengers it included tax. (The company continued to remit the tax revenue to the state.)Richard Emery, a plaintiffs' lawyer who litigated a 2009 case with similar issues, said the change in the contract was ""very powerful circumstantial evidence that they understood that their calculation of the commission was wrong.""He added, ""It seems clear that they were looking at it.""Uber's contract covers drivers not just in New York, but in all states where it operates. New York is one of the company's biggest markets, and only a subset of cities and states where Uber operates imposes tax on its fares.Roberto Machado Noa | Getty ImagesUber declined to comment.The problem with commissions has arisen amid driver discontent over a range of issues, including fare cuts instituted early last year.Beyond the commission error that Uber has conceded, The New York Times has reported that the company may have improperly deducted the entire sales tax from New York drivers' earnings.The 2015 changes to Uber's contract coincided with efforts by the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, an advocacy group for professional drivers, to point out improprieties in the way Uber was calculating its commission, as well as other issues involving improper treatment of drivers.The group's account suggests that the administration of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was also aware of the improper commission charges as of 2015.The Taxi Workers Alliance described the issue in detail in a memo and a PowerPoint presentation that it sent to the New York State Department of Labor before a meeting in August 2015. The Times has reviewed both documents, which the group went over at the meeting.The group then met in October 2015 to discuss the issues with senior Cuomo administration officials, including Elizabeth de Leon Bhargava, a deputy secretary for labor, and Ali Chaudhry, then an assistant counsel to the governor. A Taxi Workers Alliance official distributed an updated copy of the memo at the meeting.The Cuomo administration officials did not appear to take the question of improper wage practices very seriously, said Bhairavi Desai, the taxi workers' executive director, who attended the meetings.More from The New York Times:Google, not the government, is building the futureTech's frightful 5: They've got us Giving the behemoths a leg up on the little guyMs. Desai said she got the same impression during a less formal interaction with state officials in November 2015.Then, in December 2015, Uber unveiled its updated contract, which appeared to address the commission issue.A spokesman for the Labor Department, Cullen Burnell, said the department's recollection was that the meetings with the taxi workers group centered on general opposition to the ride-hailing industry rather than on the commission issue. ""We meet with all stakeholders to gather information while considering legislation, and continue to meet and work with this group on issues of common interest,"" Mr. Burnell said.Separately, a former Uber employee provided an account also indicating that company officials were aware of the commission issue in New York as long ago as 2015. The former employee, who requested anonymity because he had signed a nondisclosure agreement, said that he had seen emails from drivers complaining about the issue at least two years ago, and that Uber's response had typically been dismissive.Inder Parmar, an Uber driver in New York, corroborated this account. Mr. Parmar said he first alerted Uber to the issue of the improper commission calculations in December 2014, when Uber officials in New York held an event for drivers at a Sheraton hotel in Queens. ""We went there and mentioned it to the Uber people,"" Mr. Parmar said. ""They said they are right and we"" \xe2\x80\x94 the drivers \xe2\x80\x94 ""are having a misunderstanding.""Mr. Parmar said he later met with an accountant friend, who confirmed the commission problem after examining Mr. Parmar's trip receipts. In mid-2015, Mr. Parmar said, he went to an Uber office in Queens and showed a customer support worker the calculations that he and his friend had made. The worker told him that he was incorrect and that Uber had calculated the commissions properly.At that point, Mr. Parmar turned to the Taxi Workers Alliance, which complained to the Cuomo administration and eventually included the allegation about improper commission in a federal lawsuit it filed on behalf of drivers in June 2016.Uber officials say that they were aware of the lawsuit, but that they did not realize it had raised the commission issue before they recently discovered the problem on their own.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/uber-says-it-just-noticed-error-on-pay-but-it-was-no-secret.html
509,It can take millions to care for your special needs child. Here's how to do it,My Success Story,02-06-2017,"VIDEO3:4403:44Imagine paying a college tuition for the rest of your child\xe2\x80\x99s life\xe2\x80\xa6here\xe2\x80\x99s how one family managedMy Success StoryParents of special needs children often find themselves staring down a seven-figure bill to cover the cost of lifetime care.Coming up with that cash doesn't have to be impossible \xe2\x80\x94 if families know how to plan for it.Such was the case for the Fernandez family of Newton, Massachusetts, a couple who needed $3 million to cover the cost of lifetime care for their 23-year-old son Alex, who has autism.The family drafted a  special needs trust and funded it with life insurance to ensure that they will provide for him long after they are gone.That's just one strategy available to families to help them cover the cost of and support for their kids, all the while preserving benefits that their children may receive through the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program and Medicaid.There's also the  ABLE account, a tax-advantaged savings account for disabled individuals that was created in 2014 through the  Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act.""It's case specific, and it depends on your goals and resources,"" said Nancy Nauheimer, a wealth advisor with Northern Trust. ""A good plan can include both a special needs trust and an ABLE account.""Here's how you can get the most out of your special needs planning.Special needs trustsThough Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid are instrumental in special needs planning, disabled individuals are subject to ""means testing"" in order to obtain those benefits.This year, the monthly maximum for SSI benefits is $735 for an eligible individual and $1,103 for a couple.Alex FernandezIndividuals with more than $2,000 in assets and couples with more than $3,000 won't qualify for the  Supplemental Security Income program. A special needs trust can help them navigate this requirement.A third-party special needs trust \xe2\x80\x94 also known as a supplemental needs trust \xe2\x80\x94 is created by family members and funded with assets that aren't owned by the disabled person, including life insurance and other property.The benefit of using this trust is that the assets don't belong to the beneficiary, so they can go to other family members or to charity after his or her death, instead of going toward Medicaid reimbursement, said Nauheimer.At the very least, you'll need a lawyer to draft the document, a trustee to administer the funds, and an accountant to handle the trust's income tax filings.Trusts can be subject to steep income taxes. The top rate of 39.6 percent kicks in when income exceeds $12,500.A simple special needs trust can cost between $2,500 and $3,000, but the expense will vary based on the complexity of the client's situation, the size of the firm handling the case and the attorney's billing rate,  Nauheimer said.Families will also need to review and update their overall estate plan to ensure that the special needs trust coordinates with it.ABLE accountsABLE accounts allow families to sock money away for a beneficiary and have it grow on a tax-deferred basis. Distributions are tax-free if used for  qualified disability expenses.Beneficiaries must have been diagnosed with a qualifying disability by age 26.Katja Kircher | Getty ImagesThese accounts can receive up to $14,000 a year in total annual contributions. In order for the beneficiary to remain qualified for government benefits, the ABLE account's balance must not exceed $100,000.Proponents of these accounts tout their slimmer administrative structure compared to special needs trusts.This makes the ABLE account friendlier for families who may not have millions of dollars to provide their children but have just enough to set aside each year.A good plan can include both a special needs trust and an ABLE account.Nancy Nauheimerwealth advisor, Northern Trust""You don't have the set-up costs, trustee selection, and trustee fees of a special needs trust,"" said Mary Morris, CEO of ABLEnow, a savings program offered by Virginia.Once the beneficiary dies, Medicaid can file a claim for repayment of benefits. However, prior to that, the remaining balance of the account can be used by the estate to pay for any outstanding qualified expenses, including funeral and burial costs.Accounts through ABLEnow don't have an enrollment fee and aren't subject to minimum contribution requirements.Savers with less than $10,000 in the account can expect to pay a monthly service fee of $3.25 through ABLEnow. Asset-based fees ranging from 0.37 percent to 0.40 percent also apply if you choose investments.   Building a life care planIt's not enough to just have money set aside for your loved one, be it in a special needs trust or an ABLE account. You'll need a written plan that will specify how you'd like your family member to be cared for.Here's where to begin, according to Russell J. Fishkind, an estate planning attorney and partner at Saul Ewing LLP:Establish your team: Funding care with a variety of assets can get complicated quickly, so you may want to coordinate with a team of experts, including an estate planning attorney, an accountant and a life insurance professional.Create a life care plan: To provide your loved one with the best care, draft a document that will list his or her medical needs, social circles, dietary needs and the successor trustees involved. Detail the financial resources available, too.""Many individual trustees are concerned about assuming responsibilities for a loved one,"" said Fishkind. ""If you show them the resources are there and give them directions to dispense their fiduciary duty, it's not as daunting.""Review your beneficiary designations: The biggest mistake you can make is to name your special needs child as the beneficiary of a qualified plan or life insurance policy, as this will hurt his or her ability to get government aid.""Integrate your beneficiary designations with your special needs plans so that the insurance or qualified plans go right into the trust and the beneficiary doesn't lose government benefits,"" Fishkind said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/it-takes-millions-to-care-for-your-special-needs-child-heres-how-to-do-it.html

What we have here is essentially a consensus view that Prime Minister May was going to run away with this election,"" Boris Schlossberg, managing director of foreign exchange management at BK Asset Management, said Thursday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""The snap election (given such a label because it is occurring earlier than was originally intended) is slated for next Thursday, and what was initially perceived as an likely victory for the Conservative Party led by Prime Minster Theresa May over the Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn is being called into question as Corbyn's side gains ground.A surprising outcome in the election may cause unrest in global equity and currency markets, particularly as the U.K. embarks on negotiating the terms of its exit from the European Union. Schlossberg said the vote could likely be more important than recent European elections.May called the snap election because she thought she was going to expand her majority, Schlossberg said, but ""now she finds herself in a very, very tough battle against an opponent who is hated by 80 percent of his own party. This is what's absolutely amazing: she's been able to bungle what seems to be a sure thing.""Indeed, the latest poll of U.K. voters shows May's lead against Corbyn has fallen to 5 points, down from 15 points. Polling firm YouGov on Friday projected May was 13 seats short of the 326 seats needed for a majority victory in Parliament. A member of May's party was charged Friday with electoral fraud and will remain a candidate in the race.May came to power in the summer of 2016, shortly after the ""Brexit"" referendum in which the U.K. voted to leave the European Union. But by calling this election, she appears to have misread the voters, Schlossberg said. While he does not expect her party to lose its majority, they could well lose seats.Schlossberg added that a blow to May will be ""perceived as a loss for the pound and a loss for U.K. assets because she's going to be in a much weaker position to negotiate the Brexit with the European Commission,"" which is responsible for overseeing European Union legislation.Prior European political elections have turned in largely positive outcomes as gauged by the markets; the French election, which took place in two rounds in late April and early May, was perceived a positive for the markets as newcomer Emmanuel Macron won against far-right opponent Marine Le Pen (who was in favor of leaving the European Union). Before that, Dutch center-right Prime Minister Mark Rutte won against his opponent, the nationalist and anti-European Union candidate Geert Wilders in the Netherlands. Both outcomes were more or less seen as rejections of far-right populism.Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May reacts as she speaks at an election campaign event at Pride Park Stadium on June 1, 2017 in Derby, United Kingdom.Getty ImagesIn a note to clients on Friday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch foreign exchange strategists wrote that currency markets appeared ""overly complacent"" given recent polling data suggesting the Conservative Party could return to power, and could ultimately hurt the pound in the near term.As a result, strategist Kamal Sharma wrote of the pound, ""Market complacency on expectations for a sizeable majority was one of the motivating factors behind our view that GBP was likely to face near-term headwinds in the coming months as investors ""buy the sizeable majority, sell the fact.""Still, Sharma wrote in the note (the title of which refers to May as ""Theresa Maybe"") that a strong showing for the Conservative Party would prove initially bullish for the pound but not for a sustained amount of time.In the options market, investors appear to be preparing themselves a bit for a currency move, according to a Friday note from Brown Brothers Harriman. Although options activity shows that ""at least some investors are buying downside protection,"" the global currency strategy team led by Marc Chandler wrote it remains 'surprised by the stability of the sterling.'""From a technical standpoint, the pound and the benchmark stock index in the U.K. appear to be paying next week's British election no mind, said Piper Jaffray's chief market technician, Craig Johnson.The pound has traded against the dollar in a sort of sideways range between about 1.2 and 1.3, Johnson pointed out. Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 index just logged five straight weeks of gains and it hovered around record-high levels in Friday trading.""At this point in time, markets seem to be not particularly worried about this election coming up given that they remain fairly calm,"" Johnson said Thursday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/heres-the-big-potentially-disruptive-event-that-traders-are-ignoring.html
512,What bankers really think of Brexit,Brexit,02-06-2017,"Day one of negations between the U.K. and the European Union ended with Brussels getting its way on the timetable for Britain's exit from the economic bloc, leaving no illusions that London was not in control of its own destiny. The biggest threat to Britain's economy comes from efforts to diminish London's dominance in financial services.  Continental leaders, politicians, and regulators are determined to end the City of London's right to trade financial products across the EU and move thousands of jobs to the continent. EU citizens represent 35 percent of those working in mergers and acquisitions and investment banking in the City of London, according to efinancial careers. Some big banks, including Goldman Sachs, have announced plans to move some of their staff to European cities.CNBC interviewed 10 people working in the finance industry, from junior investment bankers to senior analysts to find out what's really on their minds about Brexit and how it will impact their lives and the wider City of London. To ensure the respondents would answer truly and freely, the interviews were done on the basis of anonymity. 'Brexit will be a failure'Most respondents do not think the U.K. will end up benefiting from its decision to leave the EU, mainly in the short-term.Brexit will be a ""failure,"" a currencies strategist at a European bank told CNBC in an interview at her office, adding ""The economy is shooting itself in the foot.""  A senior U.K. economist also made the same economic point: ""Brexit will be a failure. It wasn't a necessary condition to revamp the U.K. economy."" The U.K. economy surprised in the aftermath of the vote avoiding a collapse that many economists had predicted. However, nearly a year after the vote, data has showed a slight slowdown in gross domestic product (GDP). The Office for National Statistics said in May that GDP grew just 0.2 percent in the first quarter of 2017, from 0.7 percent growth in the final three months of 2016. Rising prices in the wake of Brexit seem to be hitting consumer spending.Brexit is the stupidest thing I've ever seen in international politics.Euro zone economistBut there are also the political consequences from Brexit. ""Brexit is the stupidest thing I've ever seen in international politics. It's breaking the country,"" a euro zone economist at a consultancy firm told CNBC over the phone in reference to the anti-Brexit views in Scotland and in the capital. One of the 10 respondents added that Brexit will be a failure but ""mostly"" for the European Union. ""I think it could be the start of the end of the EU project,"" the head of a forex strategy at a European bank told CNBC.'Brexit is a concern and an unwelcome uncertainty'Simon Dawson | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA junior equity analyst told CNBC via email that Brexit is a concern on a professional basis.""Firms will consequently incur monetary costs (given that the UK will have to renegotiate trade agreements with the EU and other global partners) and at the very least, a large shadow has been cast over the short- and medium-term investment horizons. Even if we were to assume that labor was cheaper and more efficient in the UK compared to mainland Europe, why would a company (large or small) invest in a new office or factory in the UK without knowing what types of restrictions will be imposed on its products when sold/shipped overseas? I believe that this will significantly reduce the employment prospects of current and future generations with few, if any, positive impacts for average UK citizen. This obviously leads to a major personal concern as my wellbeing in this country, as for many others, is largely dependent on my ability to be employed,"" he said. The euro zone economist surveyed is from Denmark but works and lives in the U.K. At the moment, he does not plan on applying for U.K. citizenship.""I will reevaluate when I get my tax information,"" he said.""People would be lying if they say they aren't worried about Brexit. No matter what, our (EU citizens) rights will be diminished,"" he added, acknowledging that he is in an ""easy"" situation. ""I make money, I'm clean, I'd be allowed to stay in 5 minutes (if he had to apply for a visa),"" he said.I don't want to go, but I might have no option\xe2\x80\xa6It is really upsetting.Currencies strategistA currency strategist divided her answer into two aspects, for the country and for her own life. ""I am quite fearful for the economy, the housing market is weakening and savings are low ... Also, the political uncertainty regarding future trade hurts investment and is, therefore, a concern for the long term.""She added: ""This sort of threat above the industry doesn't make anyone happy."" She mentioned that with two teenage children a possible relocation would be more problematic.""I don't want to go, but I might have no option \xe2\x80\xa6 It is really upsetting,"" she said.Those with less experience and without children are more willing to relocate but at a price.""I'd try to stay in London. I would only consider moving if the compensation was sufficiently high,""  a senior U.K. economist said mentioning Paris and Barcelona as the most attractive options.'The City won't disappear but it will lose importance'Simon Dawson | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWith banks and financial companies having to relocate some personnel so that they keep trading euros and the uncertainty surrounding the rights of EU citizens living in the U.K. it is unclear what shape the City of London will take. However, most respondents believe London's role will be deminished.I am worried that going forward Europe will not have any financial center of global importance anymore.Junior Investment Banker""I think London will lose a significant amount of importance as a financial center in the aftermath of Brexit. Companies have already and will continue to move people to other cities across Europe. While I don't think that any other European city will replace London as a global financial center I am worried that going forward Europe will not have any financial center of global importance anymore,"" a junior analyst at one of the biggest investment banks told CNBC via email.A sovereign risk analyst made the same point, predicting a ""slow erosion of the financial sector in London, not only because of new EU rules but also the loss of EU workers.""The City of London will not come to an end, he said, ""but it will come under threat.""A global head of CROCI (cash return on capital invested) investment at an investment bank, who has been in the City for about 30 years, shared the same opinion: ""The City will not necessarily come to an end but the role will be diminished.""You might see people working 2,3 days in the continent and the rest at home in the U.K.British investment banker\xc2\xa0However, one of the respondents showed optimism in the future of the City.

513,A potential teacher crunch looms,Help Wanted,02-06-2017,"VIDEO2:2402:24Widening teaching shortage hits Detroit Digital OriginalPublic school teachers are on the front lines for the nation's youth when it comes to education, mentorship and support. But a growing shortage of educators is adding pressure to a group that advocates say is already spread too thin in schools across the country.Donavon Gardner is watching the scenario play out at the Mason Academy, an elementary and middle school in Detroit. The special education teacher is in his 11th year, following in his mother's footsteps as a public school educator, drawn to the idea of giving back to his hometown, where he's coached basketball and mentored students.""I felt like I was really needed in this community,"" Gardner said. ""There are a lot of households that don't have fathers, and I felt like I could fill that void in a sense. I felt my need would be best served in Detroit Public Schools.""But make no mistake, the job isn't easy. The Detroit Federation of Teachers said the Detroit Public Schools Community District is currently 250 teachers short, with only 150 spots being filled by substitute teachers. The additional 100 classrooms are vacant on any given day, according to the union.""A number of educators have left the district because of poor conditions of our classrooms and the attacks on the teaching profession as a whole,"" said Terrence Martin, executive vice president of the Detroit Federation of Teachers. ""There has to be a commitment from the government to lower class size, and teachers need to be compensated fairly for the work they do.""The pay scale ranges from $37,000 to $65,000 a year in Detroit, Martin said, lower than neighboring districts. Class sizes can balloon to as many as 40 students at a time, making the job difficult for educators like Gardner, who works with students from second through eighth grades and has 25 students a day. The Detroit Public Schools Community District did not respond to request for comment from CNBC.The issue goes far beyond Detroit. The American Federation of Teachers, a national labor union, said U.S. public schools must fill 300,000 teacher vacancies each year, but a shortage is growing across the country, exacerbated in inner cities and rural areas. A recent report from the Learning Policy Institute found that from 2009 through 2014, teacher education enrollments dropped by 35 percent, a deficit of 240,000 teachers available for hire over that time period.""Demographers are saying that by 2025, if these trends continue, we will basically be 100,000 teachers short for every year after 2025,"" said AFT President Randi Weingarten. She said compensation, poor public school funding, over-testing of students and negative perceptions of the profession have led to deteriorated enrollment in teaching programs across the country.For the 2015-2016 school year, the U.S. average public school teacher salary was $60,132, according to the AFT, sourcing data from the National Education Association. Benefits packages vary by contract and location.The annual attrition rate for teachers in the United States is 8 percent, nearly double that in places like Finland, Singapore and Ontario, Canada, where public schools are ""well-funded, teachers are given time to collaborate, given opportunities to develop their skills and are respected by school administrators and the public,"" the AFT said in a statement. But pay is a major reason the shortage is growing, as many teachers receive bachelor's degrees and go on to earn their master's before entering the classroom, where salaries are too low.The new administration isn't helping to ease concerns among public education advocates either, with President Donald Trump's controversial choice of Betsy DeVos for Education Secretary, known for her championing of school choice. The president's budget blueprint also cuts 13.5 percent, or $9 billion from the Education Department's budget. The department did not respond to multiple requests by CNBC for comment.""We are very worried about what is going to happen to poor kids in rural and urban areas under this administration,"" Weingarten said.Back in Detroit, the teacher federation's Martin said he's hopeful the city's new Board of Education will usher in change, but added that the city's ongoing budget crisis hasn't helped the teacher shortage.""I think we are finally at the point right now that we can start to talk about the turnaround,"" he said. ""I surely hope the issue with class size and the issue with the lack of teacher service is a problem of the past, and I look forward to working very hard with the school district to alleviate this issue.""Despite the hurdles that come along with working in a district suffering from the shortage, Gardner said the payoff he sees in the classroom makes the job well worth it.""The best part for me is the love I get from my kids,"" he said. ""Seeing them develop and actually teaching them.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/a-potential-teacher-crunch-looms.html

Cohn's comments were in response to questions about President Donald Trump's Thursday afternoon announcement to pull the U.S. out of the global climate accord. Among the reasons cited for the move, the president said the Paris Agreement dramatically hurts the U.S. coal industry. Cohn, director of Trump's National Economic Council, said on ""Squawk on the Street"" that there's a place for coal in America's energy mix from an economic perspective. He did not wade into the debate on whether carbon dioxide emissions from burning coal for power plants and industrial factories contribute to global climate change. ""At some point in the cycle, coal will be competitive again,"" Cohn said. ""We want to be in the coal business because we know there's a cyclical nature to all these commodity prices. And when coal is the feedstock of choice, we need to have that feedstock to be globally competitive."" Cohn, formerly second in command at Goldman Sachs, acknowledged that current market forces make coal more expensive than some energy alternatives. ""The price of natural gas because of the technological advances we've had in the United States, and all the fracking development in what we've done to create an abundance of natural gas, has made the price of coal less favorable today. That could change very quickly,"" he said. Many CEOs were critical of Trump's decision, including Cohn's former boss, Goldman Chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein. Cohn told CNBC he has not spoken to Blankfein since his current boss, the president, abandoned U.S. commitments to the Paris climate agreement made during the presidency of Barack Obama. ""But I did get caught off guard when [Blankfein] started tweeting last night,"" said Cohn, referring to Blankein's first-ever tweet.Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world. #ParisAgreementOne corporate leader in support of Trump's move is Robert Murray, chairman and CEO Murray Energy, an Ohio-based coal giant.

""But LULU's business itself isn't a fad, and while it's not immune to fashion mistakes or competition, it's not going to make that many fashion errors and the competition seems to have fallen behind again.""A Lululemon Athletica store in Pasadena, California.Getty ImagesDespite the Labor Department's Friday jobs report missing estimates, the market still went higher, telling Jim Cramer that Wall Street is really only interested in one key factor.""It's the same story that we've seen all year, the same one I've been coming with the same one I've been telling you: it's about profits,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Yep, corporate earnings have been so positive in 2017 that investors are reluctant to sell because from an asset class perspective, stocks are pretty much the only decent game in town, unless you think that 10-year Treasurys yielding 2 percent are a good place to put some money.""With the market's unfaltering attitude in mind, here are the stocks and events Cramer will be watching next week: On Monday, Cramer's watching Thor Industries, the world's largest recreational vehicle manufacturer in the country and a stock on which Cramer has been very right and very wrong.""I'm tempted to believe that Thor has course corrected, but you know what? Here on 'Mad Money,' it's kind of like the NHL. We put companies in the penalty box ... so I'm adopting a wait-and-see approach for Thor,"" Cramer said of the company's Monday earnings report.Tuesday brings an earnings report from Dave & Buster's, and Cramer expects terrific earnings from the restaurant and entertainment center company when it reports after the bell. The ""Mad Money"" host expects Dave & Buster's to announce expansion plans as well.In most cases, Cramer would not focus on earnings from the wine and spirits giant behind Jack Daniels whiskey, but chatter of Constellation Brands eyeing Brown-Forman as a takeover target caught his eye.""I think that would be very out of character for Constellation,"" he said. ""Still, it will be a closely listened to [Wednesday's] conference call because of that rumor.""On Thursday, ski resort operator Vail Resorts will report earnings before the bell, and Cramer blessed it as a trade.""This has been a terrific story for some time,"" he said. ""Vacations have become Facebook rites of passage and Vail's been benefiting from this trend for ages.""Cramer says a selloff is possible on Friday ahead of Fed meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday of the following week if the market gets worked up over this Friday's lagging jobs report.""Remember, most investors and all holders of bank stocks, for heaven's sake, which have been horrendous, want to see the Fed raise rates as a sign of economic health. We're in the odd position of worrying that the Fed might not tighten after this weaker [labor] report that we got this morning. If they do nothing, there will be selling, so why not get out ahead?"" Cramer said.A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York.Brendan McDermid | ReutersCramer also sat down with Exact Sciences Chairman, President and CEO Kevin Conroy, who said his company's blockbuster colon cancer test, Cologuard, is paving the way to the development of new cancer detectors.""The same technology that powers Cologuard, this advanced technology that finds cancer DNA in a stool sample, we're now showing proof of concept of detecting lung cancer from a simple blood draw, liver cancer from a simple blood draw,"" Conroy told Cramer on Friday.And while he admitted his industry is competitive, Conroy was confident about the future of his company's technology.""It is a competitive environment, but there are two aspects of this environment. There are some people who are developing tests to help guide the right cancer treatment. We're all about early detection, and our technology is less expensive than some of those other technologies that guide treatment, enabling us, we believe, over the long run, and I want to stress this, over the long run, to be able to offer tests that detect cancer early,"" the CEO said.Andrew Liveris, CEO of Dow Chemical.Adam Jeffery | CNBC While Dow Chemical Chairman and CEO Andrew Liveris was disappointed at President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, he was not discouraged about the era of renewable energy.""Look at our renewable energy already, with how many jobs it has. The solar, wind and bios. We're going to keep supporting that. This is advantage America,"" the CEO told Cramer on Friday.Liveris, who also heads Trump's manufacturing council, acknowledged the trade-offs inherent in moving the country towards using energy that produces less carbon, a key contributor to climate change.""Can we keep all of our energy jobs? No. But can we manage the transition? Yes,"" Liveris said. ""I think this president, he just wants to manage the transition so coal miners don't get hurt overtly. There is a base of people out there. Look, we've got to respect the fact that he's the leader of the country. I believe that we've got to stay engaged to get the better answers.""Lightning Round: This Stock's Like a Kevin Durant VictimIn Cramer's lightning round, he ripped through his take on some caller favorite stocks, including: Gilead Sciences: ""Did you see when [Golden State Warriors basketball player] Kevin Durant ran right through everybody and did that lay-up? One of the players that he ran right through was Gilead. It just stood there and watched.""Advanced Micro Devices: ""I think AMD's fine. I mean, I think that the quarter was good.

517,"Apple still 'major player' in the voice assistant race, says Siri creator, who is now helping Samsung",Tech Transformers,02-06-2017,"VIDEO2:4902:49Why AI voice assistants are part of a broader tech raceStreet Signs EuropeApple is still a ""major player"" in the voice assistant space with Siri, one of the technology's co-creators told CNBC on Friday, despite the U.S. technology giant receiving criticism for falling behind rivals Amazon and Google.Adam Cheyer was one of the people behind Siri which was acquired by Apple in 2010. Since then, Cheyer has created a next generation voice assistant called Viv which was acquired by Samsung in 2016. Viv is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Samsung with the South Korean titan looking to integrate the technology into future products.Voice assistants have become the next battleground for technology giants. Amazon's Alexa, which is in products such as its Echo home speaker, is perceived to be the leader, while Google Assistant is gaining traction.But Apple has been slated for not keeping up with the competition.""In our view Apple's Siri has developed little since it was first introduced in 2011. It has brought the concept of voice-led services to the consumer mindset but has fast gone from leader to laggard in the application of this form of technology in our view,"" Neil Campling, head of technology, media and telecom research at Northern Trust Capital Markets, told CNBC by email on Friday.Adam Cheyer, co-founder of Siri and Viv LabsPhoto courtesy Adam CheyerCheyer, however, said Apple is still very much in the game but the ultimate winner will be the company that can turn their voice assistant into a technology across multiple devices.""I am very proud of what we accomplished to initially take this new paradigm and bring it out to hundreds of millions of people. I think Apple is doing good work and is still a major player in this race,"" Cheyer told CNBC in a TV interview on Friday.""What's going to matter is which companies can elevate an assistant from where it is today, a utility \xe2\x80\xa6 to be this ubiquitous paradigm and I think Apple and everyone else is in the game and it will be great for consumers no matter who wins.""Of course, Cheyer is making a rival product to Apple's Siri for Samsung. He was tightlipped on the product roadmap, however. Samsung's latest phone, the Galaxy S8 has an artificial intelligence assistant built in called Bixby. It allows user to not only speak to it, but to hold their camera up to landmarks or items in order to call up information about them.Bixby is reportedly built on Samsung's own technology and not Viv's, but the two are likely to integrate.""We are working on a next generation assistant and we will deliver it through Samsung's devices, perhaps under the Bixby brand eventually but also to other interfaces,"" Cheyer said.The plan is to try and get Viv's technology across a number of devices, not just smartphones, but also home appliances and other gadgets.""Right now there is a race to the single interface where all of the big companies Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and now Samsung are trying to make the assistant the next paradigm like the browser, like the smartphone, you'll have an assistant to help you in your lives,"" Cheyer said, explaining the company's ambition.Amazon has made a similar play. Earlier in the year it announced plans to bring Alexa to LG refrigerators and even Huawei's Mate 9 smartphone. It's an attempt to create a new way to interact with devices. And there is big money involved. A recent research note from RBC Capital Markets suggested that Alexa could bring the U.S. e-commerce giant $10 billion of revenues by 2020 and be a ""mega-hit"".Viv has similar ambitions and plans to open the platform up to developers so they can make apps and find other uses for the voice assistant.""You will be able to do everything you do for computing through an assistant interface,"" Cheyer said.\xe2\x80\x94Correction - This story was updated to fix a typo and show Viv is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Samsung.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/apple-siri-samsung-bixby-voice-assistant-race.html
518,Walmart is accused of punishing workers for sick days,Retail,02-06-2017,"A Walmart worker organizes products for the Christmas season at a Walmart store in Teterboro, New Jersey.Eduardo Munoz | Reuters A report released Thursday by a workers' advocacy group says Walmart, the nation's largest private employer, routinely refuses to accept doctors' notes, penalizes workers who need to take care of a sick family member and otherwise punishes employees for lawful absences.The report, based on a survey of more than 1,000 employees, accuses Walmart of violating the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Family and Medical Leave Act, among other worker-protection laws. The group argued in a lawsuit filed last month, and in an earlier complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, that Walmart discriminated against pregnant workers.""Walmart should fully comply with the law so that no one is illegally punished for a disability-related absence or for taking care of themselves or a loved one with a serious medical condition,"" said Dina Bakst, a founder and president of A Better Balance, the advocacy group that prepared the report.More from The New York Times:  How Twitter Is Being Gamed to Feed MisinformationAirbnb Is Popular, but Renting Out Your Car? That's Another StoryUber Says It Just Noticed Error on Pay, but It Was No SecretWalmart said that it had not reviewed the report but disputed the group's conclusions, and said that the company's attendance policies helped make sure that there were enough employees to help customers while protecting workers from regularly covering others' duties.""We understand that associates may have to miss work on occasion, and we have processes in place to assist them,"" Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for Walmart, said. The company reviews each employee's circumstances individually, he said, ""in compliance with company policy and the law.""Katie Orzehowski says her miscarriage last fall almost cost her a job.A cashier at the Walmart in North Huntingdon, Pa., Ms. Orzehowski said she tried to use doctors' notes and hospitalization records to excuse her missed shifts, to no avail. Worried that another absence would get her fired, she went back to work.""I still had a lot of bleeding going on, and that's embarrassing,"" Ms. Orzehowski, 26, said.Her account is one of dozens included in the report, which clashes with the company's recent efforts to project a more worker-friendly image.Walmart has long been known for its penny-pinching attention to detail and its opposition to organized labor. But in the past couple of years, the company has announced that it would raise its minimum wage to $10 an hour and has pledged to invest heavily in training and paying workers.Workers' advocates have expressed skepticism about the retailer's commitment to improving the lives of its more than one million employees. Around the same time that Walmart lifted wages, it cut merit raises and introduced a training program that could keep hourly pay at $9 an hour for up to 18 months.In November, A Better Balance filed a complaint with the employment commission on behalf of Arleja Stevens, a Walmart employee who said she was fired after missing too many shifts because of complications from her pregnancy.In that filing, the group accused Walmart of violating the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. The employment commission is investigating the accusation, Ms. Bakst said.Mr. Hargrove said the company disagreed with Ms. Stevens's claims.A Better Balance also participated in a separate lawsuit last month alleging that Walmart discriminated against pregnant employeesThe company has disputed the claims of the two women at the center of the suit.A Better Balance wrote the survey questions used for Thursday's report. The questions asked employees whether they believed that Walmart had a problem of regularly punishing people for absences relating to an illness or disability, and about how the company treated absences. The group worked with the labor group OUR Walmart, which promoted the survey to workers who listed Walmart as their employer on Facebook, according to Andrea Dehlendorf, a director of OUR Walmart.""Although this system is supposed to be 'neutral' and punish all absences equally, along the lines of a 'three-strikes-and-you're-out' policy, in reality, such a system is brutally unfair,"" the report says of Walmart's absence-control policy. ""It punishes workers for things they cannot control and disproportionately harms the most vulnerable workers.""Walmart assigns disciplinary points for unexcused absences and other infractions. Nine points in a six-month period can result in an employee's being fired, according to a copy of the company's absence policy reviewed by The New York Times. New employees may be fired for accruing four points in their first six months.While Walmart has written guidelines for how managers and supervisors should respond to employees who need help because of medical issues, those policies are not always followed, according to the report.""They just straight up tell you, 'We don't accept excuses,'"" said Ms. Orzehowski, who still works for the company.In a follow-up email, Mr. Hargrove said that the company did ""not have any information that would support that Ms. Orzehowski advised us of a medical reason for her absences.""""If that were the case, she could have used those medical records to apply for a leave or accommodation,"" he said.The Americans with Disabilities Act requires businesses with 15 or more employees to make reasonable accommodations for disabled workers. In 2008, the definition of a disabled worker was expanded, to include temporary medical conditions like complications relating to a pregnancy.The Family and Medical Leave Act protects eligible workers \xe2\x80\x94 those who have been employed for 12 months at a company with 50 or more employees \xe2\x80\x94 who need to take time off to care for themselves or a family member.Under the A.D.A., employers must work with employees to determine if workers are eligible for such accommodations. Dismissing doctors' notes or otherwise refusing to consider the reason for a worker's absence could potentially be ""skirting the analysis"" in which employers are required to engage, according to Michelle Caiola, the director of litigation for Disability Rights Advocates, a nonprofit group, and a former senior trial lawyer for the E.E.O.C., which enforces federal worker protections.""A company as big as Walmart, it's surprising that they don't have the appropriate training for the personnel that would be overseeing these sorts of leaves,"" Ms. Caiola said.Mr. Hargrove said that the company had worked with ""countless"" employees to successfully authorize their absences from work.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/walmart-is-accused-of-punishing-workers-for-sick-days.html

The U.K.'s FTSE 100 hit a fresh record high as markets opened but retreated after subdued U.S. non-farm payrolls data.The U.S. generated a modest 138,000 new jobs in May and revised employment growth in the spring down from levels initially reported.

Richard Burr (R-NC)Getty ImagesA top GOP senator said he does not believe Congress will pass a bill to repeal and replace key parts of Obamacare this year.Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina also said the deeply unpopular Republican health bill passed by the House to undo much of Obamacare is ""dead on arrival"" in the Senate.""It's ... not a good plan,"" Burr said in an interview with WXII 12 News in his home state.""It's unlikely that we'll get a health-care deal,"" said Burr, head of the Senate's Intelligence Committee. ""I don't see a comprehensive health-care plan this year.""""At the end of the day, this is too important to get wrong,"" he said, when a reporter pointed out that his fellow Republicans are keen to pass a bill this year.Burr said that because a health-care bill is unlikely to be passed into law this year, he is focused on seeing what can be done to help residents of his home state, Iowa and Tennessee, where there is a dearth of competition among Obamacare insurers.Republicans have campaigned for years on promises to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, the landmark health-care law that expanded insurance coverage to about 20 million Americans under President Barack Obama.VIDEO4:2604:26Sen. Franken: House health-care plan is 'terrible'Squawk BoxRepublicans complain that the ACA led to unaffordable insurance rates for many people in the individual health plan market, and also objected to the law's mandate requiring most people to have some form of coverage or pay a fine.The election of President Donald Trump last fall, combined with their control of both chambers of Congress gave Republicans this year their first real chance at accomplishing their goal of getting rid of Obamacare.But GOP leaders struggled to pass a bill in the House that would move toward that goal. They only managed to win approval for it by a single vote on May 4.The Congressional Budget Office estimated that that bill, if it became law, would lead to 23 million more people becoming uninsured by 2026 than would be the case if Obamacare remained in place.A number of Republican senators before Burr have dismissed the idea that they would approve the House bill in its current form.Instead, a group of GOP senators has been meeting to discuss crafting their own bill.Conservative senators want a bill that would more aggressively undo Obamacare. But moderates in the GOP caucus oppose rolling back gains in health coverage, particularly those seen as a result of the ACA's expansion of Medicaid benefits to more poor adults.

Finland is certainly not the sick man of Europe any more,"" said Alex Stubb, the former finance minister who used that description for his country in 2015.More from Financial Times: Chinese group Fortune Fountain Capital to buy Baccarat glasswareG7 allies lead anger at Trump's exit from Paris climate agreementBillionaire Anbang boss Wu Xiaohui barred from leaving ChinaOne of the most vocal advocates of austerity in the EU, Finland had been mired in recession for much of 2011-15, hit by a cocktail of problems from the decline of Nokia and the forestry industry to sanctions on neighbouring Russia and a rapidly ageing population.But economists said the first-quarter growth was driven by strong exports that were aided by the weaker euro as well as solid contributions from private consumption and construction.Still, they cautioned that Finland was one of the rare EU countries whose gross domestic product is still lower than its peak before the financial crisis. Pasi Sorjonen, chief analyst at Nordea Markets, said his bank had calculated that Finland needed to record annual growth of 1.8 per cent in each of 2016, 2017 and 2018 to reach the previous peak.""We are coming from behind. There is a big gap that we must narrow first and then come past the others,"" he added.Further challenges remain. The three-party coalition government has aimed to cut Finland's labour costs \xe2\x80\x94 which have risen faster than any other large EU country since the financial crisis \xe2\x80\x94 but still has to pass important healthcare and municipal reforms. Business people have privately expressed concerns about the pace of reform for much of the past decade. ""There is no need to take the foot off the accelerator. We have to continue with these reforms,"" said Mr Stubb, noting that the centre-right prime minister and finance minister were committed to them.The coalition could be tested this summer when a leadership vote in the Eurosceptic True Finns could result in the party taking a more hardline approach in government to staunch its dramatic fall in opinion polls.Mr Sorjonen said that the government should not be too self-congratulatory as the economy had been boosted by strong eurozone growth in countries such as Germany, and a weaker euro, which has helped manufacturing across the continent.""I fear that with these nice numbers, more and more politicians will find themselves content and they will stop doing further reforms,"" he added.Another issue could be in this autumn's wage negotiations. Labour unions are eager for pay increases after two years of freezes. The government has tried to deflect those calls, saying workers should wait until the recovery is more entrenched.But Mr Sorjonen said he was ""scared"" about the wage talks. ""The unions forget how far we lag behind [the rest of the eurozone]. They should remember this is just a first step \xe2\x80\x94 we need to continue at this pace for a long time,"" he added.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/finland-no-longer-sick-man-of-europe-as-economy-grows.html
523,"Who owns HNA, China\xe2\x80\x99s most aggressive dealmaker?",Asia: Business,02-06-2017,"Chen Feng, chairman of HNA GroupChris Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFrom a Buddha-shaped building on the tourist island of Hainan, HNA Group has transformed itself into one of China's most aggressive dealmakers \xe2\x80\x94 and drawn new scrutiny of its ownership and financing. Founded as a provincial airline by economic reformers who drew on World Bank support, the parent of Hainan Airlines has grown into a sprawling, privately held international conglomerate.To fuel its growth, it has skilfully leveraged existing assets to fund the purchase of new ones \xe2\x80\x94 a process known in Chinese as ""a snake swallowing an elephant"".But the company's $40bn deal spree \xe2\x80\x94 most recently it became Deutsche Bank's largest shareholder by building up to a 9.9 per cent stake \xe2\x80\x94 has brought it criticism on several fronts. HNA recently became caught in the crossfire of a political storm involving Wang Qishan, China's anti-corruption tsar and one of its most powerful politicians. Its heavy use of debt has also drawn concern from Standard & Poor's and some overseas bankers.More from Financial Times:  Chinese group Fortune Fountain Capital to buy Baccarat glasswareG7 allies lead anger at Trump's exit from Paris climate agreementBillionaire Anbang boss Wu Xiaohui barred from leaving ChinaHNA's corporate structure is complex. Its $145bn in assets now include New Zealand's largest financial services firm, a stake in Hilton Hotels and aviation services companies in at least 14 countries. It operates the world's third-largest aircraft rental fleet.Domestically, HNA owns a smorgasbord of property developers, leasing firms, four regional airlines, a respected financial magazine and one of China's largest peer-to-peer lending platforms, JuBao Internet Technology. It has raised funds through at least 11 peer-to-peer platforms, many of which it has invested in, as well as through loans to its roughly 25 listed companies.Overseas, it has chosen some politically connected partners. The company invested together with Jeb Bush in a fuel shipping business when he was considering a presidential run, and it bought SkyBridge Capital from hedge fund manager Anthony Scaramucci when he was hoping to join the Trump Administration.Currently HNA is 76 per cent owned by just 13 individuals, all but one of whom are current executives with the group, according to corporate filings. Founder and public face Chen Feng \xe2\x80\x94 a Buddhist with a taste for luxury cars \xe2\x80\x94 and the chairman of the board, Wang Jian, own about 15 per cent each after many years of complex asset reshuffles that effectively privatised the firm.But HNA's ""very complex and convoluted shareholding structure"" has prevented either man's inclusion on the annual Hurun list of China's richest men and women, according to Hurun founder Rupert Hoogewerf. ""We have been trying to get Chen Feng on there but we just can't find any way to show that he's got enough money.""HNA's largest single shareholder is also the most mysterious: Guan Jun, who purchased nearly 29 per cent of the company last year from Hong Kong-based businessman Bharat Bhise. HNA declined to say how much the stake sold for and Mr Bhise did not respond to request for comment.Mr Guan serves as co-chairman with Mr Chen's son in a peer-to-peer financing platform owned by HNA, but he otherwise leaves few traces for a man who wields billions in assets.He first bought into HNA subsidiaries seven years ago, through an investment vehicle that operates out of HNA's Beijing offices. But HNA says Mr Guan is a ""private investor"" who does not work for the company.Chinese corporate registries list several other business addresses for Mr Guan. One leads to the ""Oriental Aphrodite Beauty Spa"", a street-side salon in a residential neighbourhood in western Beijing. The current owners say he sold the salon about five years ago. Another address led to a locked door in a shabby Beijing office building. His residence, according to Hong Kong corporate filings, is a nondescript apartment in south-west Beijing whose current occupant says she moved in a few months ago.Reached by mobile phone, Mr Guan said: ""It is inconvenient to answer any of your questions.""Mr Bhise no longer has a stake in HNA. His firm Bravia Capital co-invested with HNA in several of its largest overseas acquisitions, including the $1bn purchase in 2012 of SeaCo, the world's fifth-largest marine container firm.He is also the man who introduced HNA to its most celebrated foreign investor, George Soros. Mr Soros has since sold most of his $50m stake in HNA's flagship subsidiary, Hainan Airlines.That airline is where HNA's story starts and one reason it has become caught up in factional politics today. For HNA's corporate heritage draws from reform experiments launched in the late 1980s, when Wang Qishan was a promising young technocrat rising in the shadow of his powerful father-in-law, Communist party elder Yao Yilin.Now Mr Wang is the powerful anti-corruption tsar who has led a wide-ranging purge of China's military, security forces and ruling Communist Party.But in the past month, an exiled businessman with ties to the state security apparatus has pushed forward allegations that Mr Wang's wife's family improperly benefits from ties to HNA.Guo Wengui, the former business partner of an imprisoned security official, has claimed on widely viewed Twitter posts over the past month that Yao Qing, a nephew of Mr Wang's wife, has benefited from a hidden shareholding in HNA.""The allegations with regard to HNA simply aren't true. Neither Wang Qishan nor his nephew by marriage, Mr Yao, are shareholders in HNA Group,"" a spokesman for HNA Group said. Mr Wang did not respond to request for comment. Mr Yao could not be reached.What is clear is that Mr Wang has close ties to the men who built the company that has become HNA.Back in the 1980s, China received soft loans from the World Bank to help fund the country's economic reforms as it recovered from 30 devastating years of Communist orthodoxy. At that time Mr Wang set up the China Agricultural Development Trust and Investment Co (CADTIC) to channel World Bank loans to the rural sector. Chen Feng, HNA's founder, worked under him. World Bank assessments of those early loans are gushingly positive.Then came the June 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protests centred on Tiananmen Square. Western nations imposed sanctions and China's economic reforms suffered under a conservative backlash.But a core group of CADTIC bureaucrats \xe2\x80\x94 including Mr Chen \xe2\x80\x94 sought to get around the sanctions. They moved to Hainan, the sub-tropical island that was at the time a blank slate for market reform experiments, and appealed to the World Bank for help. The resulting aid was channelled through the newly founded Xingnan Group, according to You'll Make It, a memoir by CADTIC veteran Huang Xiaohe.Xingnan Group provided the start-up capital for Hainan Airlines and recruited many of the men who are now its top executives, including current chairman Wang Jian, according to the memoir. Other senior HNA executives include former Hainan government officials and the former head of state-owned rubber farms that were among the earliest World Bank loan recipients.CADTIC, meanwhile, fared less well. By 1996, reeling under Rmb5bn in losses, its Rmb12bn in debt was absorbed by China Construction Bank, by then headed by Wang Qishan. Soon after, he cleaned up the $2bn default of the Guangdong International Trust and Investment Co, or Gitic, sealing his reputation as a reliable political firefighter and starting his climb to the top of the party.Reporting by Lucy Hornby, Sherry Ju, Liu Xinning, Tom Mitchell and Archie Zhang in Beijing, and Don Weinland in Hong Kong.

524,Republicans grapple with Medicaid as lawmakers return to Washington,Politics,02-06-2017,"VIDEO2:1802:18Republicans grapple with Medicaid expansionDigital OriginalAs lawmakers return to Washington next week, health care remains at the top of their agenda.One of the key sticking points among Republicans is what to do about Medicaid, especially in red states like Arkansas, many of which are choosing to expand the program. But they will have a hard time paying for expansions without continued federal support. Medicaid is designed to help low-income people get health care.Whatever gets decided is sure to affect patients, health-care workers and the overall economy.For people like George Coleman, who drives a cab for a living in Little Rock, Arkansas, it could be a life-or-death decision. He struggled to pay for health care as his asthma worsened and the cost of his medication reached nearly $700 a month.The state's expanded Medicaid program allows Coleman to purchase health insurance, making his out-of-pocket costs affordable.""It would have been impossible for me to survive without government assistance with health care,"" Coleman said.Despite suffering from a past heart attack and diabetes, Kentucky resident Mary Blair was able to receive medical coverage through Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.Luke Sharrett | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesColeman is one of 330,000 people in Arkansas to sign up for the expanded Medicaid coverage since 2013, far exceeding initial estimates of 250,000. Now, the state's lawmakers worry that popularity has made the program too costly to maintain, especially as the federal government's share of the burden begins to dwindle. Medicaid is jointly funded by states and the federal government, with Washington matching costs at least dollar for dollar. For the 32 states like Arkansas that expanded coverage under Obamacare, the feds paid 100 percent of the costs of newly eligible individuals between 2014 and 2016.As the law stands right now, Washington's share is set to gradually decline to 90 percent by 2020. But the GOP's House-passed American Health Care Act would cut enhanced federal funding entirely by 2020. You can't have a massive shift to the states that they cannot absorb, because if that happens, then we are going to curtail ...\xc2\xa0our coverage, and it's going to result in more people being uninsured.Asa HutchinsonGovernor of ArkansasArkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson inherited the decision to expand Medicaid in his state. Along with state lawmakers, the Republican made changes to the program's income and work qualifications so as to reduce enrollment by 60,000 people.""We've got to cut the cost curve both for the federal government and for the state,"" Hutchinson said, adding that whatever Congress does, it shouldn't burden the states, which have to balance their own budgets.""You can't have a massive shift to the states that they cannot absorb,"" he said, ""because if that happens, then we are going to curtail even further our coverage, and it's going to result in more people being uninsured."" Hospitals such as the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences may bear the brunt of any cost shifts. Since Medicaid was expanded in the state, the hospital has seen the rate of uninsured patients it cares for fall from 15 percent to only 3 percent. The lower level of uncompensated care helped the medical center record a profit \xe2\x80\x94 and hire more than 1,000 workers.Looming cuts jeopardize the finances of health care providers across the state, especially considering decreases in the Medicare payments set to go into effect, said Dr. Dan Rahn, chancellor of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. ""There's a complex interplay \xe2\x80\x94 hospitals are the largest employers in many communities, and they are essential to economic development in their community,"" Rahn said. ""No community can experience economic development in the future if it does not have sufficient health-care resources in that community.""

526,Your retirement savings will undergo this major change next week,"Your Money, Your Future",02-06-2017,"VIDEO3:5403:54Hightower CEO warns investors about the fiduciary ruleFast MoneyThe long-awaited regulation that aims to protect your retirement savings and require your financial advisor to work  in your best interest will take effect June 9.The Department of Labor had delayed the original April 10 start date by 60 days after President Donald Trump issued a  presidential memorandum in February, calling on the agency to review the regulation and prepare an updated economic and legal analysis.""When investors receive retirement investment advice, they will receive pretty significant protections and the advice will be in their best interests,"" said Micah Hauptman, financial services counsel at the Consumer Federation of America.The rule covers 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts (IRAs). Here's what you can expect starting this month. You can also consult the DOL's list of frequently asked questions for additional help.Addressing\xc2\xa0conflictsStarting June 9, your financial advisor and his or her firm will need to comply with the ""impartial conduct standard.""This requires financial advisors to charge no more than reasonable compensation, avoid misleading statements and, perhaps most importantly, provide advice that's in the best interest of the investor.Additional requirements will take effect on Jan. 1, 2018. These provisions include  specific written disclosures that financial services firms and advisors must make to clients.At the heart of the battle over the rule, which was hotly contested by the financial services industry, is $7.85 trillion in IRA assets. These accounts are moneymakers for firms as clients often roll their savings out of 401(k) plans when they retire or change jobs.Meanwhile, the Labor Department is still reviewing the ""fiduciary rule,"" per Trump's presidential memorandum.In the DOL's list of frequently asked questions, the department said it would seek additional public input regarding ideas for possible new exemptions or regulatory changes based on recent comments.The DOL will ask the public whether an additional delay of the Jan. 1 portion would ""allow for more effective retirement investor assistance"" and help firms avoid additional expenses that may clash with how Labor ultimately proceeds.Artiga Photo | Getty ImagesIndustry responsesOrganizations representing financial services firms have pushed for more delay.""While we are disappointed that the Department of Labor has chosen not to further delay the rule until the Department has completed a review of the entire rule's impact on investors, we appreciate Secretary [Alexander] Acosta's recognition of the rule's negative impact and his desire to seek public input,"" said Kenneth E. Bentsen, president and CEO of the  Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, in a statement.Nevertheless, many firms have already adopted changes to help mitigate conflicts of interest, including the use of mutual fund ""clean shares,"" which  exclude certain fees.More from Your Money, Your FutureUse these tools to figure out if you can retire earlyTax burdens prompt more Americans to ditch their citizenshipForget the 4 percent rule.

""We get protections in phases.""To be sure, you need to perform your own due diligence on your financial advisor.Look him or her up on BrokerCheck, a site maintained by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the advisor page of the Securities and Exchange Commission.Ask the following questions. Are you a fiduciary? Find out immediately if your advisor is acting in your best interest. Get the point across with this fiduciary oath from The Committee for the Fiduciary Standard. It's best to ask this question in writing. ""If you deliver the questions orally, you get a wishy-washy answer,"" said Scott Puritz, managing director of Rebalance IRA. ""Send an email and request that the answer come back in writing.""How are you paid for your services? Ask whether you're paying a fee for your advisor's help, be it hourly, as part of a subscription or based on assets he or she manages for you. Find out whether your advisor receives a commission for the sale of mutual funds, insurance and annuities.Where do you keep your assets? Some large broker-dealer firms will hold your assets in custody because you have a brokerage account with them. If you're using an independent fee-only advisor, he or she will likely hold your assets at a custodian, such as TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab or Fidelity.  ""Don't let your advisor take your money and move it to their account,"" said David J. O'Brien, principal at Evolution Advisers in Midlothian, Virginia. Be sure to match the statements you get from your custodian and the statements your advisor provides you.What are your qualifications?

527,The Chinese airports snapping at Hong Kong's heels,Transportation,01-06-2017,"There was joy in the streets of Foshan's backwater Gaoming district in mid-April when Guangdong Communist Party secretary Hu Chunhua affirmed plans to build an airport there by 2022.The new, 35 billion yuan (US$5.1 billion) Pearl River Delta regional airport, designed to handle 30 million passengers a year, will be a key piece in the province's ambitious plan to have 31 big and small airports by 2030. It will join the delta's five existing key air hubs \xe2\x80\x93 Hong Kong, Macau, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Zhuhai \xe2\x80\x93 to serve a dynamic area that's home 66 million people and has an economy as big as South Korea's.Travelers stand in line to check-in at Hong Kong International Airport in Hong Kong, China, on Mar. 10, 2017.Anthony Kwan | Bloomberg | Getty Images While mainland China has many airports with few passengers \xe2\x80\x93 three-quarters of its 200-plus airports run at a loss \xe2\x80\x93 rapid growth in demand for passenger and cargo services in the delta is giving a boost to all five airports, with Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Shenzhen accounting for the most traffic.Concerns about excessive competition between the airports were unwarranted for now, said Law Cheung-kwok, head of the Aviation Policy and Research Centre at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, because the overall market was still growing.""Passenger numbers can increase in a geometric ratio in the coming years ... fuelled by the strong demand of Chinese spenders for travel and the emerging Chinese consumer economy,"" Law said, while adding that Hong Kong would see ""fiercer"" competition from mainland airports that were aggressively launching new long-haul flights.More from the South China Morning Post: Hong Kong tops Singapore as world's most competitive economy The six best airports to sleep in - Hong Kong, Singapore included How the QR code has forever changed China's social habitsHong Kong's role as an international air hub was once highly valued by Guangdong, which saw the city as its gateway to the outside world. High-value products from factories in the Pearl River Delta used to be trucked into Hong Kong before being flown to overseas markets, but the flow has been changing, especially since the launch of Guangzhou's new airport in 2004 and Shenzhen's in 2013.Hong Kong International Airport, the leading airport in the region, handled 70.5 million passengers last year, up 2.9 per cent year on year. In comparison, Guangzhou's Baiyun International Airport handled 59.7 million passengers, up 8.2 per cent. Shenzhen handled 42 million passengers, up 5.6 per cent, and Zhuhai handled 6.1 million, which represented annual growth of 30.2 per cent. A record 6.6 million passengers passed through Macau airport last year, up 13.7 per cent year on year.The five major airports, all within 150km of each other, are all striving to expand. Guangzhou plans to add a fourth and a fifth runway by 2025 and Shenzhen has plans in place for a third. Hong Kong aims to open a third runway by 2023 to boost capacity to 100 million passengers a year.VIDEO3:0603:06OBOR: 'No initiative in history has been perfect'Street Signs AsiaGuangzhou's existing Terminal 1 was only designed to handle 35 million passengers a year, but a second, bigger, terminal will open next year. Expected to handle around 45 million passengers a year by 2020, the new terminal is being built at a cost of about 19 billion yuan.Shenzhen is also planning a new terminal, with passenger traffic at the four-year-old airport now just 3 million short of its 45 million capacity.However, Zhuhai, billed as China's biggest airport when it opened in 1995, has never come close to its 35 million passenger annual capacity.People like retiree Zhu Yinghua and businessman Huang Honghui are making the most of the leisure and business opportunities provided by the region's increasing air traffic.Zhu, a 65-year-old retired teacher from Guangzhou, made three overseas trips last year, visiting Russia, Turkey and the United States with her husband and friends. The trips cost between 6,000 and 10,000 yuan, quite affordable for retired teachers and civil servants in cities such as Guangzhou who receive monthly pensions of more than 6,000 yuan.""It's much easier to travel to the other end of the world these days than travelling to Shanghai 20 years ago,"" said Zhu, who had never flown until 1993, when she was 41, and who made her first overseas trip in 1996 when she visited Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia via Hong Kong.""I have to say now I like the Shenzhen and Guangzhou airports very much. They are more beautiful and modern than any other airport in China, including Beijing or Hong Kong.""The number of tourists heading overseas from mainland China has more than tripled in the past decade, hitting 122 million last year, and Guangzhou and Shenzhen are among the top sources.The ""Greater Bay Area"", a region which includes Hong Kong, Macau, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai and some other mainland cities, is becoming the world's biggest market for aviation services. Passenger numbers in the region will reach 223 million a year by 2020, up from around 175 million last year, according to the China Civil Airports Association, which said such traffic would dwarf other bay areas such as Los Angeles, New York and Tokyo. Airports in the Tokyo Bay Area, home to 43 million people in 2015, handled more than 112 million passengers that year.VIDEO1:3101:31Hong Kong International Airport is making a push for retailSquawk Box AsiaHong Kong, the world's largest international air cargo airport, handled 4.5 millions tonnes of air cargo last year according to the Airport Authority, and the China Civil Airports Association predicts annual cargo throughput in the region, presently about 8 million tonnes, will top 10 million tonnes by 2020.Huang, the 40-year-old co-founder of leading Guangzhou air logistics company R&T Transportation, says business is booming, with the firm handling about 5,000 tonnes of cargo a month, more than triple the amount a decade ago.""I started up my logistics business 20 years ago and most clients are factories in the delta, from electronics giants like Huawei and Samsung to garment processors,"" Huang said. ""In 1997, my company handled an average of 500 tonnes of cargo a month, 90 per cent of which was exported through Hong Kong airport.""He said Guangzhou's airport now handled three-fifths of R&T's shipments because it was closer to most clients. ""If we pick up a delivery at 6pm, we can catch the flights leaving Guangzhou at 2am \xe2\x80\xa6 it would take about two days to fly through Hong Kong,"" Huang said.Meanwhile, airports in Southwest China cities such as Kunming in Yunnan province and Chengdu in Sichuan province were grabbing air cargo business from Hong Kong and Guangzhou.""It took three days to travel from Kunming to Guangzhou by truck 10 years ago,"" Huang said. ""But now, thanks for the rapid development of China's highway network, it only takes one day. Flying out of Kunming airport would help cut costs by 30 per cent compared with Hong Kong airport.""R&T now handles about 1,000 tonnes of air freight a month in Kunming.Local authorities in major mainland cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xian, Zhengzhou and Shenzhen were handing out generous subsidies and extra investment for local airports so they could operate more international routes, in line with the central government's ""belt and road"" trade and infrastructure initiative.VIDEO1:4201:42'OBOR is the perfect tool for China to push influence'Squawk Box Asia""For example, the government of Zhengzhou, in Henan province, is offering subsidies of up to 300,000 yuan per overseas flight,"" Huang said.While Hong Kong will remain a busy airport, its relative regional significance is set to wane as mainland airports get bigger and mainland airlines improve their hardware. Mainland Chinese carriers bought 164 Boeing planes last year, about a quarter of Boeing's total deliveries and the most from any country.The mainland's three designated hubs \xe2\x80\x93 Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou \xe2\x80\x93 are trying hard to gain a prominent foothold on the global flight map.In the 1990s and early 2000s, almost all tour groups from South China flew via Hong Kong, but times have changed. When Zhu, the Guangzhou pensioner, flew to New York from Guangzhou last year she transited in Beijing because ""it's 1,500 yuan cheaper than flying through Hong Kong"".Zhou Guosheng, a Guangzhou-based tour guide who has been in the business since the 1990s and now specialises in luxury overseas trips, said: ""A night in Hong Kong plus shopping time was once standard, but not any more.""Big mainland airports are even trying to lure non-Chinese travellers, who are now offered 72-hour transit visas.Hong Kong's airport will see ""growing challenges"" from mainland ones, according to Guangzhou-based aviation researcher Peng Peng, who predicted Guangzhou would overtake Hong Kong airport in passenger numbers ""within 10 years"".",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/the-chinese-airports-snapping-at-hong-kongs-heels.html

Zopa hopes to win business from established branch-based incumbent banks in the U.K. by offering a digital technology-focused bank that will operate online and on mobile later this year.The capital for the U.K. crowdfunding and financial technology (fintech) pioneer comes from Wadhawan Global Capital (WGC), an Indian financial services firm, and Northzone. The latter venture capital (VC) fund has backed Spotify, iZettle and MarketInvoice in the past.Kapil Wadhawan, Chairman of WGC, will join the Zopa Board as a non-executive director following the investment.Last November, Zopa unveiled its plan to launch a next generation digital bank that takes deposits from savers and offers a range of P2P investment products, plus personal loans, car finance and credit cards. The capital fundraising will allow it to do this.It received regulatory approval last month from the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to offer the Innovative Finance Individual Savings Account (IF ISA) investment to savers, strengthening its investment portfolio options.The crowdfunder says it will apply for a full U.K. bank license later this year and use the new money to help support the build-out of the necessary technology infrastructure and product range.The new bank account and products will be part of the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) when launched. This means savings and investments will be protected and extra regulation is necessary because Zopa will then be a deposit-taking institution.Zopa was one of the first online P2P lenders in the U.K., launching in 2005. In January it surpassed the \xc2\xa32 billion mark in terms of the value of loans it has made, a first for a European crowdfunder, with \xc2\xa3800 million coming in the past year alone.In a statement, Jeppe Zink, a partner at the Northzone VC fund, said: ""We believe Zopa is a blueprint of what the modern, technology-first bank will \xe2\x80\x93 and should \xe2\x80\x93 look like, based on transparency and customer service. Zopa is already a trailblazer in the market, and is in a strong position to build on this, with the launch of their new products.""Northzone announced a new $300m fund last year and said at the time it was eyeing U.K. fintech start-ups as an investment target.The latest fundraising round brings Zopa's total capital raised so far since its establishment in 2005 as a disruptive force in the U.K. leading market to \xc2\xa387m.

I think they applauded because they knew it was going to put this country at an economic disadvantage,"" he said during a White House press briefing. ""And the reason European leaders ... that I think they want us to stay in, is because they know it will continue to shackle our economy,"" he said.Pruitt's comments are remarkable because the United States has historically counted many European countries as its closest strategic allies. The U.S. is also the European Union's largest trade partner and its biggest export market.The United States has a seat at the table. After all, we're the United StatesScott PruittEPA administratorPruitt's remarks echoed comments by President Donald Trump on Thursday, when he announced he was pulling the United States out of the Paris Agreement, an international treaty aimed at mitigating the effects of climate change.Trump said he was open to renegotiating the Paris Agreement or creating an entirely new accord after the United States withdraws.Leaders of major European nations roundly rejected that prospect. In a statement to CNBC, a European Commission official said, the ""Paris Agreement is non-negotiable.""Asked how Trump would negotiate given that European leaders are not interested, Pruitt suggested the United States could not be sidelined.""The United States has a seat at the table,"" he said. ""After all, we're the United States.""VIDEO2:1302:13Pruitt: Accord cost us a substantial amount of moneyPower LunchIt is unclear what a negotiation would look like. For one, the Paris Agreement is the result of more than two decades of climate diplomacy. And while the accord requires signatories to submit plans to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, it gives them wide latitude to create plans to meet those targets and does not bind them legally to achieve them.Pruitt said any deal that requires the United States to set emissions targets that are enforced through domestic regulations or laws should be ratified by the Senate.The United States has largely reduced its carbon emissions through technological innovation, particularly through advanced drilling methods that have allowed American producers to tap vast supplies of natural gas. Pruitt said the United States could contribute to global emissions reductions by exporting its technology and know-how.There is significant opposition to the key technology behind the U.S. shale gas boom \xe2\x80\x94 a process called hydraulic fracturing \xe2\x80\x94 in Europe.

530,Trump administration asks Supreme Court to let travel ban take effect,Politics,02-06-2017,"People wait in line to enter the US Supreme Court.Getty ImagesThe Trump administration on Thursday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to allow the president's blocked ""travel ban"" order to take effect, following a defeat at an appeals court last week.The Justice Department urged the Supreme Court to allow it to enforce the executive order now, while the justices consider whether to hear the appeal.It also asked the court to fast-track the case, which could result in the justices hearing it before its new term begins in the fall. The court normally disposes of all pending cases by the end of June.More from NBC News:As Trump quits climate pact, states step inCasino robbery ends with dozens dead at resort in PhilippinesFact checking Trump's Paris agreement speech""We have asked the Supreme Court to hear this important case and are confident that President Trump's executive order is well within his lawful authority to keep the nation safe and protect our communities from terrorism,"" Justice Department spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores said.""The President is not required to admit people from countries that sponsor or shelter terrorism, until he determines that they can be properly vetted and do not pose a security risk to the United States,"" she said.Thursday's move was a certainty after a federal appeals court last week  voted to uphold a ban on enforcement that was imposed by a federal judge in Maryland. Another appeals court, on the west coast, has yet to rule on whether to uphold a similar ban issued by a federal judge in Hawaii.After President Trump's first executive order  was blocked in court, the president signed  the second one. It would impose a 90-day ban on entry to the U.S. from Iran, Sudan, Syria, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen. It would also suspend for 120 days the refugee program.The 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Virginia ruled May 25 that the president's executive order is likely unconstitutional, because it's based on religious discrimination.Statements made during the campaign, the court said, make it clear the executive order stems from ""President Trump's desire to exclude Muslims from the United States.""But in their appeal Thursday, the Justice Department said determining what candidate Trump and his aides meant would require ""judicial pscychoanalysis.""""The decision below is the first to hold that a provision of federal law \xe2\x80\x94 neutral on its face and in operation \xe2\x80\x94 violates the Establishment Clause based on speculation about its drafters' supposedly illicit purpose,"" the Justice Department said.Government lawyers also said that, at most, a ban on enforcement should apply only to a one of the challengers in the Maryland case, a man who seems to bring his Iranian wife to the United States. The lower courts were wrong, the Justice Department said, to apply the enforcement ban nationwide.The justices will likely seek the views of the challengers before deciding whether to grant any of the government's requests.Trump has said the order is necessary to protect Americans from terrorists. Critics have called it a ""Muslim ban,"" something Trump has denied.

""The primary reason is pretty simple \xe2\x80\x94 our target price is $1,070,"" Kessler told CNBC. ""With the stock a shade under $1,000, that's roughly 7 percent upside.. ...

""If the EC proceeds with penalties \xe2\x80\x94 people are aware of the size of that fine, and that Google has more than enough funds .... to cover that. I don't know that the financial fines would be the most significant negative.

Patients in the U.S. accounted for 46 percent of that spending.More from NBC News:As Trump quits climate pact, states step inCasino robbery ends with dozens dead at resort in PhilippinesFact checking Trump's Paris agreement speechThe report predicts annual growth of between 6 percent and 9 percent through 2021.Extremely expensive targeted immunotherapy drugs have driven changes in both spending and cancer care, the report finds.""During the past decade, advances in personalized medicine and immuno-oncology have fueled a major shift in treatment of cancer,"" the report reads.Traditional cancer treatments have always included surgery and still do, but old-fashioned chemotherapy was a blunt weapon aimed at any fast-growing cell. Chemo has improved but the targeted therapies can help select groups of patients even more, with fewer side-effects.""Since 2011, the cancer treatment landscape has been transformed by new medicines which target 22 different types of cancers,"" the report reads.These include  drugs such as Keytruda, which takes a new approach to treating cancer by stopping tumor cells from cloaking themselves against the immune system response that normally takes out cancerous cells.  Keytruda \xe2\x80\x94 known generically as pembrolizumab \xe2\x80\x94 targets the activity of genes called PD-1 (anti-programmed-death-receptor-1) and PD-L1.Keytruda costs about $12,500 a month, or $150,000 a year. It's been approved for a growing list of tumor types and earlier this month became the first cancer drug ever approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to be used on any solid tumor, based on its genetic profile. Other drugs with similar actions include Tecentriq, known generically as atezolizumab.Drug companies are encouraged by the effectiveness of these drugs, quicker approval times and the price tags, too.The FDA and other regulators have approved 68 new cancer drugs since 2011 and 631 potential new drugs are in development, Quintiles found.The median approval time from a company getting a patent on a drug to final FDA OK has dropped from 10.25 years in 2013 to 9.8 years in 2016, the report also found.One type of cancer that's benefited from research advances is melanoma, the report noted.Melanoma  is a big killer.

In recent months, several companies and governments have pulled advertising from the platform due to concerns their brands were being associated with inappropriate videos.One of the more high-profile incidents of this was in February when Disney cut ties with the popular Swedish YouTuber Felix Kjellberg, better known as ""PewDiePie"", because of allegedly offensive content in his videos.A smartphone with the logo of the Youtube video sharing website on the screen, in front of a computer screen showing the front page of Youtube.Sergei Konkov | TASS | Getty ImagesKjellberg said the videos, which included him paying people using the freelance job site Fiverr to hold up a sign with an anti-Semitic message, were intended to ""show how crazy the modern world is.""""I picked something that seemed absurd to me\xe2\x80\x94that people on Fiverr would say anything for 5 dollars (sic),"" he said in a Tumbler post in February.In a blog post published Thursday, Ariel Bardin, VP of product management at YouTube, said many advertisers had resumed their media campaigns on the video hosting platform thanks to the conversations and new controls YouTube has implemented.The new guidelines attempt to clarify what content is eligible for advertising.

535,The one financing risk never to take when starting a business: $50-million-a-year restaurant mogul,Iconic Tour,02-06-2017,"When it comes to making a personal business guarantee, Will Beckett has one piece of advice: Don't do it.The co-founder of the London-based steakhouse company Hawksmoor built the $50-million-a-year restaurant empire without ever putting personal assets on the line. But it was an easier decision for Beckett than other entrepreneurs.""We didn't guarantee personal assets, because we had none,"" Beckett said of starting out with several money-losing restaurants at age 26 in 2003 with his best friend, Huw Gott, before striking gold with the Hawksmoor concept. ""In retrospect, that was a blessing. I would never now put my family's security on the line to make more money. I used to draw no distinction between my finances and the company's finances. Now I have a very clear line between the two.""Childhood friends Huw Gott (left) and Will Beckett founded Hawksmoor, the British steakhouse and cocktail-bar chain, in 2006.Source: HawksmoorBeckett's advice comes at a time when financing has tightened for entrepreneurs. Now to get a loan for an early stage or risky venture, banks often require applicants to make a personal guarantee, or a vow to repay funds with personal cash and/or assets in case of default. The arrangement can be tempting for everyone from restaurateurs to online entrepreneurs, but is risky for borrowers who may be required to put up their primary residences or life savings as collateral. Most entrepreneurs and experts agree that betting the house should be a last resort.Here are a few ways to protect your personal assets when starting any business.Structure your business wiselyShailesh Kumar, who now runs a financial advisory site, ValueStockGuide.com, was working with two banks in 2008 to recapitalize his steel-service center business when he was asked to put up his primary residence as collateral, despite having more than enough equipment and inventory to cover it.Luckily, he'd already set up a holding company for all the steel service centers and other lines of business he owned as individual entities. This way, he owned equity directly in the top-level holding company but not the individual entities. The move cost him $500 using a company incorporation service and protected hundreds of thousands in personal assets when in 2009 he was forced to liquidate the steel business when the manufacturing sector took a tumble.VIDEO1:1501:15Billionaire Todd Wagner: Two things determine if you're fit to be an entrepreneuriCONIC Conference""I satisfied the debt holders by turning over the collateral in the business that supported the debt, but we also owed money to many of our suppliers that we could not pay,"" he said. ""We had many tense meetings with the suppliers, with them trying to threaten action against my personal assets, but the two layers of corporate veil I had in place stood the test in courts. I was able to get debt written off, and there was no impact on the personal assets at all.""More from iCONICThe crucial decision Elon Musk made when he was flat broke Why Disney's Bob Iger pitched a $7 billion deal on his second day as CEO The female entrepreneur who said not to Wal-Mart's lowball offerThe best way to save your personal assets is not to offer them up at all.""Find a lender who will accept an obligation limited to [a corporate] entity without a personal guarantee,"" said Phil Crowley of New Jersey-based Law Office of Philip P. Crowley. ""Creative solutions also involve using loans [including from friends and family] that are obligations only of the entity and are convertible into equity in the legal entity subject to certain conditions.""To do this correctly, hire a lawyer with this specialized experience to set up the paperwork, Crowley said.When signing documents on behalf of the business, be sure to put the entity's name alongside it so it is clear you are acting as the entity and not as an individual, he said.Bulletproof your leaseBanks aren't the only ones that may request a personal guarantee. Commercial lessors often do, too, and they may have the ability to sue for the remaining term of the lease if things go south. Consider negotiating with the landlord to limit the term of your personal guarantee.""For example, on a five-year lease, ask for what's called a burn-off, where your personal guarantee will expire, say, after 2.5 years,"" said Kerry T. Boyle, a partner at the Ohio law firm Isaac Wiles.Ask for the ability to terminate the lease if sales are lower than forecasted, Boyle said, otherwise known as a ""gross sales kickout.""Alternatively, if sales aren't solid, you can ask the landlord to allow you to pay a percentage of gross sales instead of the stated rent amount, limiting your financial liability a little.Many times, entrepreneurs will have preconceived notions about what is 'required' to be successful in a certain industry. A lot of times those ideas are floated by people who stand to make a buck selling their product or service.John WeningerVision Wealth PartnersAsk yourself: Do you really need that bank loan or whatever it is you want to buy?""Many times, entrepreneurs will have preconceived notions about what is 'required' to be successful in a certain industry,"" said John Weninger of the Wisconsin-based Vision Wealth Partners, which advises small businesses. ""A lot of times those ideas are floated by people who stand to make a buck selling their product or service to gullible entrepreneurs who just don't know.""Consider all of the free, rentable or lower-cost tools that can be used to boost a new business before borrowing a large sum or hiring people, he said. Purchasing a business address is cheap and offers credibility while working out of a home office, while strategic partnerships can offer free yet valuable resources. ""Consider approaching existing businesses who may be able to [share] space, resources \xe2\x80\xa6 that is of little or no cost to you,"" Weninger said. Hire interns through a college program instead of employees to keep labor expenses low, he added.Hawksmoor is expanding to the United States with a restaurant in New York City's World Trade Center set to open later this year. They financed the WTC restaurant with their current revenue and investor funding. The co-founders now have the luxury of being able to finance expansion based on the value in the business and its cash flow. But Beckett sees several restaurant entrepreneurs spending very large amounts of their personal wealth to keep up in the competitive dining environment, and it reminds him of when they started their first restaurant on a shoestring.""It's a real source of concern for me,"" Beckett said. ""What is it you are signing away if this goes wrong?""Bottom-line business-building lessonsNever pledge personal assets to finance the start of a new business.Use a legal structure that keeps personal assets and business assets separate.Forming a holding company and some commercial lease provisions offer protections.Consider other options if a bank or commercial landlord wants personal assets pledged.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/guy-who-has-50-million-a-year-restaurant-chain-on-the-one-personal-risk-he-never-took-starting-a-business.html
