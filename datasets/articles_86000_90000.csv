4,Euro Developments Point to More Weakness Despite Directionless Trade,Currency Contest,07-11-2011,"Some initial currency bids on news of an agreement between the Greek PM and opposition leader to form a new unity government to approve the EU/IMF bailout were easily absorbed early Monday, with the market coming back under pressure as broader fear of contagion into the Italian economy became more of a reality. The political turmoil has spread to Italy and many are focused on the budget vote out of the country which could open the door for additional deterioration within the broader Eurozone economy. Italian bond spreads have since widened to record levels.Elsewhere, the Franc is the weakest performing major currency on the day thus far, with Eur/Chf off to the races following some Franc bearish comments from SNB Hildebrand over the weekend, much softer CPI data and increased speculation that the central bank will make another move to raise the Eur/Chf peg.The Australian Dollar is also one of the weaker currencies on the day, with the risk off market environment and some softer ANZ job ads weighing on the higher yielding currency. Another theme weighing on sentiment in the early week could also be coming from a lack of response from the G20 on the Eurozone, with the group instead opting to let the zone deal with its own problems rather than injecting its own money into the problem.Still, markets haven\xe2\x80\x99t strayed too far on Monday, and in the end, we have seen some more intraday volatility and consolidation. Economic data out of the Eurozone on Monday was softer across the board, highlighted by some unnerving Eurozone retail sales and German industrial production prints, but a suspicious rally ahead of North America took the Eur/Usd market back towards daily opening levels, with sources attributing the gains to rumors that Italian PM Berlusconi would be stepping down.Looking ahead, economic data in the US is a non-factor, with the only notable release coming in the form of US consumer credit. On the official circuit, Fed Rosengren, EU rehn, SNB Jordan and EU Barroso are all slated to speak. US equity futures are tracking moderately lower, while commodities are bid, led by a +1% rise in gold prices.",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/07/euro-developments-point-to-more-weakness-despite-directionless-trade.html

14,Warren Buffett's Berkshire Was Buying as Stock Prices Fell,Buffett Watch,07-11-2011,"One of Warren Buffett's favorite rules of investing is that the lower prices get, the more he's likely to buy.We now have another indication Berkshire Hathaway was indeed doing more buying as stock prices plunged in the third quarter.According to Bloomberg's analysis, the latest quarterly SEC filing from Berkshire shows the company investing $23.9 billion in the quarter, the most in at least 15 years.Bloomberg says that includes almost $7 billion in equity securities, up from $3.61 billion in Q2 and just $834 million in the first quarter.Bloomberg notes that in mid-August Buffett told Charlie Rose that Berkshire had spent more on stocks on August 8 than any other day this year.\xc2\xa0 That's the day stocks fell more than 6 percent in the wake of Standard & Poor's decision to downgrade the U.S. government's credit rating from AAA.In a live interview on CNBC on September 30, Buffett told Andrew Ross Sorkin:""We've bought, in the last quarter, the third\xe2\x80\x94 in the current quarter, we bought net 4 billion of common equities, which was similar to the total amount we bought in the first half.

21,Morici: It's Time for Herman Cain to Exit,The Guest Blog,07-11-2011,"Herman Cain is losing luster among Republicans. After initially holding up well in polls in the face of unproven accusations of sexual misconduct, his favorability ratings are starting to fade. His campaign may survive this controversy but it may be time for Mr. Cain to exit.Revelations that two women received cash settlements from the National Restaurant Association more than a decade ago, after complaining that then CEO Cain acted in sexually inappropriate way, is not enough to disqualify him for the presidency. Well intended Equal Employment Opportunity Commission rules for employers can encourage unwarranted finger pointing that little serves genuine victims or innocent defendants. Often, cases are settled to avoid high legal costs. That said, Herman Cain\xe2\x80\x99s responsesto charges raises concerns that he has something to serious to hide, or at least that he is not yet ready to be the Republican candidate. When confronted that two women had come forward, at first he claimed no clear recollection of misconduct charges, but later reversed himself and offered his account of what one woman alleged. Importantly, he first claimed no financial payouts were made, but subsequently recalled at least one financial settlement. It is unlikely the merits of these two complaints will ever be known. Even with a waiver available from nondisclosure clauses in the settlement agreements, these women have not been willing to identify themselves, detail their allegations and confront Mr. Cain\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to evaluate the veracity of claims without those. Sexual harassment is a scarlet letter. Just as victims never forget, men accused without cause don\xe2\x80\x99t forget either, making Mr. Cain\xe2\x80\x99s lapse of memory inexplicable. And a CEO, whose organization cashes out complaints for allegations about his own actions, should be aware of settlement agreements unless he is simply not doing his job. And those are not Mr. Cain\xe2\x80\x99s only gaffs. Mr. Cain\xe2\x80\x99s 9-9-9 tax proposal makes great economic sense but when pressed, he cannot explain why it does or how it would work. For example, when asked about how the nine percent sales tax would treat imports, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94this despite the fact that European countries have extensive experience with this issue, economist and lawyers have studied those issues ad nauseum, and the treaties the United States and EU have signed permit applying sales taxes to imports and refunding the same on exports to maintain neutrality in competition between foreign and domestic products. If Mr. Cain indeed has economic advisors, they are either negligently incomplete in their briefings, or he is disinterested in relevant details. Instead, Mr. Cain throws around 9-9-9 like a Pizza promotion, and expects us to accept he will figure things out if we elect him President. Recently, Mr. Cain appeared with Newt Gingrich in a two-man debate that resembled a town meeting\xe2\x80\x94the format afforded to each opportunity for long elaborations of positions. When Mr. Cain was asked how he would restructure Medicare, he paused, gazed to the ceiling and said \xe2\x80\x9cYou go first Newt.\xe2\x80\x9d If the GOP is united, arm-to-arm that Obama Care must be repealed or radically altered, then whomever it nominates should have a plan for controlling costs and trimming federal health spending. Those absolutely have to begin with restructuring Medicare and Medicaid, but Mr. Cain is not prepared to detail his approaches on those reforms.

31,Home Prices Under More Pressure ,Realty Check,07-11-2011,"Home prices are highly seasonal, due to the different mix of homes that sell at different times of the year, but the latest reading for September shows home prices are under added pressure now; this is not just due to the high concentration of distressed properties on the market. Prices fell 1.1% month to month, according to CoreLogic, both in seasonally adjusted and unadjusted terms. This is the second consecutive month of monthly drops, as we head into the slower fall season. The more concerning aspect of the report is that while home prices including foreclosures and short sales fell 4.1 percent from September of 2010, they still fell 1.1 percent when you exclude distressed sales. That has not been the case in previous months. ""The acceleration in the rate at which the CoreLogic house price index is falling reflects the slowing in the pace of job creation and wider economic growth earlier this year,"" says Paul Diggle of Capital Economics. While the unemployment picture has weighed heavily on home prices all year, the new uptick in foreclosure starts will likely have a more drastic effect. Foreclosure start rates on severely delinquent loans have increased to over 10 percent a month in the private-label RMBS (residential mortgage backed securities) sector, according to Fitch, which is now estimating another 10 percent decline in home prices before they fully stabilize.

""Both Democrats and Republicans don't like it, so it's not a partisan issue. There's no real need to focus on it for the election.""Another reason AMT repeal is not a political fire storm in 2012 is that most voters are calling for overall tax reform, not just one piece of it, says Isabel Sawhill, an economist at the Brookings Institution.""People are assuming and hoping that there will be some sort of restructuring of all taxes,"" Sawhill explains. ""AMT reform is part of that hope. And voters are more inclined to focus on something 'simple' like Herman Cain's 9-9-9 plan. That seems sexier in terms of politics.""An even bigger problem for politicians in a down economy would be replacing the revenue collected from the AMT.  In 2011, it will raise an estimated $39.1 billion. ""Doing away with the AMT would require replacing a lot of lost tax revenue by increasing regular taxes,"" says Joseph Perry, partner-in-charge of the Tax & Business Services practice at Marcum LLP.

Italian yields, which were at Euro-era highs, fell back across the curve. Clearly, the market thinks Italy is better off without their billionaire leader. Back in August, Berlusconi made a big show by forcing Parliament to work during what is normally the summer holiday to supposedly pass key reforms. That in response to pressure from Jean Claude Trichet, then head of the European Central Bank , and Mario Draghi, who was head of the Italian Central Bank. The two sent a letter to Berlusconi making clear he must pass reforms in order to receive help. The ECB kept its end of the bargain and began buying Italian debt on the secondary market to help bring down the country's interest rates. Berlusconi in the meantime, came up empty handed.

86,Pro Trader: Stock Market Needs to Prove Itself Wednesday,Fast Money,08-11-2011,"On Tuesday investors were struggling to make sense of the market moves, after both the S&P and the Dow plunged at the open but then clawed their way above break-even and then closed higher - in the case of the Dow, higher by triple digits.Again, the headlines out of Europe whipsawed the market with news out of Italy at first spooking the market, then cheering it.Specifically, reports out of Rome said Silvio Berlusconi, the country's prime minister, no longer held a majority and would resign. At first the market didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the uncertainty but then learned a new leader could act more aggressively to tackle the country's debt problems. By the close, all 10 S&P 500 sectors rose, however the Fast pros were most focused on banks, which generally suffer whenever Europe fears surge. On Tuesday they did particularly well.\xe2\x80\x9dJust look at the action in Wells Fargo and USB,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jon Najarian. \xe2\x80\x9cBoth are outperforming.\xe2\x80\x9d And the positive sentiment extends to overseas banks, too. \xe2\x80\x9cUBS and Deutsche Bank are also outperforming,\xe2\x80\x9d Najarian adds.What does the action mean for the market?Najarian takes the action to mean that optimism is returning to the market.

87,Jim Cramer: This Is the Most Contradictory Market,Mad Money,08-11-2011,"This stock market just doesn't make sense, Jim Cramer said Tuesday, calling it the most contradictory market in his 31 years of investing. The ""Mad Money"" host noted six ""glaring inconsistencies"" in particular:1) Oil: If Europe is weak, why does the price of oil continue to climb? Oil prices shouldn't be so high if Europe's economy is unhealthy, Cramer said. Plus, oil-producing countries, including Brazil, Iraq and the U.S., are producing more oil now than they were before.2) The euro: How can the euro  have seemingly stabilized as Greek leaders struggle to agree on a new premier and other European countries continue to struggle? The FXE , an exchange-traded fund that measures the euro versus the U.S. dollar  went up on news Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi will resign after the parliament passes economic reforms demanded by the European Union. Cramer thought it would have been just the opposite.3) European banks: Cramer thought Europe\xe2\x80\x99s financial institutions would be swooning, as U.S. banks had during the financial crisis of 2008, but they are not. Instead, European banks are buying sovereign bonds and their stocks are staying higher. 4) Gold: The precious metal  has long been the ""ultimate barometer"" of economic and political chaos, but the price of gold actually fell on news the Italian prime minster will step down. 5) Copper: Copper  also appears to have stabilized, even though the world's largest consumer of copper, China, is weaker.6) European weakness: Many American companies doing business in Europe haven't seen much European weakness, Cramer noted. Companies like Eaton , Honeywell and Oracle , for example, are not seeing the kind of weakness that was expected.So what's going on here? Cramer thinks the big hedge funds may have placed major bets that have gone wrong. These are big money bets, too, so they can move the market.To play this market madness, Cramer recommends high-yielding stocks. In a world of low interest rates, dividend-paying stocks may be the one way to make money right now.

Barney Frank, and President Obama preyed on the opportunity that would allow them to historically expand financial regulations with nominal political risk. They blamed the financial crisis on private-sector misconduct and insufficient regulation, and pursued an avalanche of new, incomprehensible, punitive regulations on one of our largest, most dynamic, and most complicated American industries. The bill, commonly known as \xe2\x80\x9cDodd-Frank\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 or as it should be called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Jobs and Housing Destruction Act\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 represents the regulatory equivalent of blaming your child for eating too much candy. Did Wall Street exploit a deeply flawed regulatory system? Absolutely. Should the practice of leveraging of toxic assets be addressed? Absolutely. But Dodd-Frank accomplishes neither goal and should be viewed as a hollow promise to the American people that a sequel to the implosion of our financial system will never happen again. As a member of the House Financial Services Committee, I was the first to introduce the bill\xe2\x80\x99s repeal because of the paralyzing effect the bill will have on the U.S. economy.

But we have drifted far from our founding principles, and our country is in crisis.Outsized growth in the federal government has replaced growth in the private sector, limiting opportunity for average Americans, while the Federal Reserve\xe2\x80\x99s policies of keeping interest rates artificially low have the unintended consequence of creating winners and losers. Winners tend to be the politically connected, who get massive bailouts or receive federal subsidies. The losers tend to be everyday Americans caught up in the hype of borrowing and spending beyond their means, the millions who are unemployed, and the families whose homes face foreclosure. Taxpayers are forced to pay for the results of bad policies. The price tag for government expansion, which has occurred for many decades under the leadership of both political parties, now matches that of our entire Gross Domestic Product. How serious is this? Consider that no happy or productive family, for example, could sustain a budget of spending every last dime it earns and borrowing 41 cents for every dollar it spends. This is what is happening in Washington, and it is only getting worse. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I have proposed an ambitious plan that slams on the brakes and puts America on a return to constitutional government. It is bold but achievable.

Establishment politicians got us into this mess, and they cannot get us out of it by tinkering at the margins of a system that is completely and utterly broken. While the establishment believes Washington can be fixed with a pair of tweezers, I know that it will require a sledgehammer. The first step to get America working again is to end the IRS as we know it with a 20% flat tax that is simple enough to file on a postcard. My Cut, Balance and Grow plan gives every American a choice: either continue to pay the current tax rates, or opt for a new flat tax with a higher standard exemption and deductions for mortgage interest, charitable donations and state and local taxes.

In February 2010, Air Products was willing to pay $60 a share for Airgas . Air Products later offered as much as $70 a share. Airgas executives thought the Air Products bid was too low, though and continued to fight the hostile takeover. In February 2011, Air Products finally walked away.Through it all, Jim Cramer recommended his ""Mad Money"" viewers stick with Airgas' stock.

CareFusion  is one such pick.A medical technology company that helps hospitals save money \xe2\x80\x94 that's right, a healthcare cost-containment play \xe2\x80\x94 CareFusion leads the market in medication dispensing with Pyxis, which is like a pharmacy in a machine.CareFusion is also the leader in smart pumps for patients receiving infusions, and it makes diagnostics and respiratory ventilation products.All of this adds up to a diversified portfolio that is shifting toward products that reduce hospital costs, improve patient outcomes and increase safety.

After Monday's close, CareFusion reported a solid quarter with in-line numbers, but the stock was dinged today, falling 14 cents or 0.55 percent.CareFusion's revenues and earnings are weighted toward the second half of next year, so this is a longer-term story, and it could be a positive one given that management plans to grow operating earnings an 11 to 15 percent annual clip for the next several years.\xc2\xa0 With that kind of growth, the stock seems cheap, trading at 12.3 times next year's earnings estimates, and more than 5 points off its high.For more, watch the full interview with Kieran Gallahue, chairman and CEO of CareFusion.",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/08/mad-moneys-jim-cramer-interviews-carefusions-gallahue.html

115,Mitt Romney: Obama Has Failed Michigan ,Republican Debate GOP Debate 2011,08-11-2011,"On Wednesday night, Republican presidential candidates will gather in Michigan for another debate. All of us taking part are acutely aware that unemployment there remains over 11 percent. In Detroit, the city of my birth, far higher joblessness has brought a great city to the edge of ruin. There will be no one on that stage this week more pained by Michigan's struggles than I am. Michigan is not alone. In eight other states, unemployment is over 10 percent. In Florida the unemployment rate is 10.6 percent. In Nevada it is 13.4 percent. At the national level, joblessness has been stuck over 8 percent for 33 consecutive months, the longest such spell since the Great Depression. This is not the way things should be. Tens of millions of Americans should not be out of work, worrying about paying their bills and losing their homes. We should not have to talk about our 21st century economy\xe2\x80\x94the economy of advanced manufacturing, life sciences, and information technology\xe2\x80\x94in the same breath as the soup kitchens of the 1930s. President Obama inherited an economy in crisis. He proceeded to make it worse. He recently put forward yet another jobs plan, or at least a jobs plan is what he calls his proposal. In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s just another budget-busting stimulus bill. Even members of his own party won\xe2\x80\x99t back it. If we want to create jobs in this country once again, there\xe2\x80\x99s a better path. Rick Snyder, Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s Governor, is not a professional politician; he\xe2\x80\x99s a businessman just like I am.

The shares trade for just under half the company's reported Sept. 30 tangible book value of $13.22.For JPMorgan Chase , the forward P/E was 6.9, based on Friday's close at $33.97 and the consensus 2012 EPS estimate of $4.94.

The shares trade for 0.6 times the company's reported Sept. 30 tangible book value of $49.50.Wells Fargo's forward P/E was 7.9, based on Friday's closing price of $25.40 and consensus 2012 EPS estimate of $3.22.

We narrowed down the list down to 21 names with three-month daily average trading volume of more than 50,000 shares.We further pared the list to the five names with the most upside implied by mean price targets among analysts polled by FactSet, limiting the group to bank and thrift holding with ""buy"" ratings from at least half the covering analysts.Here are the five bank stock picks below $5, ranked by ascending upside potential based on consensus price targets: 5. Wilshire Bancorp\xc2\xa0 Shares of Wilshire Bancorp  of Los Angeles closed at $3.42 Friday, down 55 percent year-to-date. The shares have 18 percent upside potential, based on a mean 12-month price target of $4.04, among analysts polled by FactSet.The company had $2.7 billion in total assets as of Sept. 30, with 24 branches in Southern California, Texas, New Jersey, and the New York City area, and six loan production offices in n Colorado, Georgia, Texas (two offices), New Jersey, and Virginia.Wilshire Bancorp owes $62.2 million in federal bailout funds received through the Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP.The company raised $100 million in common equity during the second quarter, following an agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and state regulators to bring main subsidiary Wilshire State Bank's Tier 1 leverage ratio up to at least 10 percent. The Bank subsidiary's Tier 1 leverage ratio was 13.24 percent as of Sept. 30.The holding company reported third-quarter net income available to common shareholders of $10.2 million, or 14 cents a share, increasing from $2.1 million, or 4 cents a share, during the second quarter, and $5.0 million, or 14 cents a share, during the third quarter of 2010.The main factor in the earnings improvement was a reduction in credit costs, with a third-quarter provision for loan losses of $2.5 million, declining from $10.3 million the previous quarter and $18.0 million a year earlier.A $5.7 million decline in loan loss reserves during the third quarter directly boosted earnings.With the company continuing its aggressive reduction of its commercial real estate loan portfolio and its nonperforming loans, Wilshire Bancorp's total assets declined 17 percent from a year earlier.During the third quarter, the company sold $28.7 million in loans, most of which were nonperforming, for a gain of $1.7 million. Net interest income declined 14 percent year-over-year to $25.5 million in the third quarter, reflecting the balance sheet reduction.The net interest margin \xe2\x80\x94 the difference between a bank's average yield on loans and investments and its average cost for loans and deposits \xe2\x80\x94 was a strong 4.23 percent in the third quarter, which was down from 4.42 percent the previous quarter, but up from 3.393 percent a year earlier.Wilshire Bancorp's ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets was 2.46 percent as of Sept. 30, improving from 3.22 percent the previous quarter and 2.87 percent a year earlier.The annualized ratio of net charge-offs \xe2\x80\x94 loan losses less recoveries \xe2\x80\x94 to total loans was 0.46 percent, and with reserves covering 5.27 percent of total loans, the company appeared well-positioned for continued significant releases of reserves.FIG Partners analyst Timothy Coffey on Oct. 28 reiterated his ""outperform"" or ""buy"" rating for Wilshire Bancorp, raising his 12-month price target to $4.50 from $3.80, also ""estimating tangible book values of $3.43 in 2011, $4.21 in 2012 and $4.84 in 2013."" The analyst said that he anticipated that ""could start to reverse the DTA-Deferred Tax Asset valuation allowance over the coming quarters,"" and that ""the improvement in the earnings power has resulted in losses below management's projections, which has increased the valuation allowance to $40 million."" Coffey estimated that ""company could have no tax expense or very limited expense in 2012 before a normalized expense returns in 2013."" The shares trade for 6.8 times the consensus 2012 earnings estimate of 50 cents, among analysts polled by FactSet, and just above their Sept. 30 tangible book value of $3.27, according to SNL Financial.Four out of seven analysts covering Wilshire Bancorp rate the shares a ""buy,"" while the remaining analysts all have ""neutral"" ratings.4. First Commonwealth Financial Corp.Shares First Commonwealth Financial Corp.  of Indiana, Pa., closed at $4.75 Friday, declining 31 percent year-to-date.Based on a consensus price target of $6.46, the shares have 36 percent upside potential.

Earnings were also affected by a $7.0 million third-quarter provision for loan losses, which was down from $9.1 million the previous quarter, but up from $4.5 million a year earlier.First Commonwealth's nonperforming assets ratio was 3.45 percent, increasing from 3.22 percent the previous quarter and 2.70 percent a year earlier, with one commercial credit relationship in Pennsylvania representing $32.8 million, or 17 percent of the company's $195.2 million in nonperforming assets.The third-quarter net charge-off ratio was 1 percent and reserves covered 1.81 percent of total loans as of Sept. 30.Following First Commonwealth's earnings announcement, Sterne Agee analyst Mike Shafir reiterated his Buy rating on the shares, with a price target of $6.50, and said that ""While NPAs rose during the quarter, the company exhibited positive trends with a higher net interest margin, lower expenses, and a reduction in the pace of loan decline."" The shares trade for 11.3 times the consensus 2012 EPS estimate of 42 cents, and 0.8 times their Sept. 30 tangible book value of $5.77, according to SNL Financial. Six out of nine analysts covering First Commonwealth rate the shares a buy, while the remaining analysts all have neutral ratings.3. Southwest Bancorp Shares of Southwest Bancorp  of Stillwater, Okla., closed at $4.58 Friday, for a year-to-date decline of 63 percent. The consensus price target of $7 implies 53 percent upside for the shares.The shares dropped 37 percent on July 26, after the company announced second-quarter loss to common shareholders of $4 million, or 21 cents a share, driven by a $20.1 million provision for loan losses, which CEO Rick Green said was taken ""as a result of new appraisals received on collateral dependent commercial real estate loans from states outside of our home markets of Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas."" The company had $2.6 billion in total assets as of Sept. 30 and holds two bank subsidiaries, including Stillwater National Bank and Trust Co. of Stillwater, Okla., and Bank of Kansas, of South Hutchinson, Kan. Southwest Bancorp owes $70 million in TARP money.The company's shares declined 17 percent on October 20, after the company reported a third-quarter net loss to common shareholders of $10.6 million, or 54 cents a share, compared to earnings of $2.8 million, or 15 cents a share, a year earlier.During the third quarter, Southwest Bancorp recorded a $24.6 million provision for loan losses, which exceeded the company's net interest income of $24 million.Green said the company was continuing ""to focus on the identification and resolution of problem and potential problem credits, and we have taken important additional steps this year to improve our lending, banking, and credit functions.Nonperforming assets totaled $203.5 million as of Sept. 30, or 7.91 percent of total assets, increasing from 6.74 percent the previous quarter and 6.08 percent a year earlier. The third-quarter net charge-off ratio was 2.70 percent, and reserves covered 3.25 percent of portfolio loans as of Sept. 30.The company reported a tangible common equity ratio of 11.38 percent as of Sept. 30. The consensus among analysts polled by FactSet is for Southwest Bancorp to report a fourth-quarter loss of 31 cents a share, followed by a 2012 loss of 60 cents a share.The shares trade for a third of their Sept. 40 tangible book value of $14.85, according to SNL Financial. The four analysts covering Southwest Bancorp are evenly split between buy ratings and neutral ratings. Southwest Bancorp is obviously a play on the tremendous discount to book value. However, Despite a relatively strong level of tangible capital as of Sept. 30, Southwest Bancorp is quite a speculative play, with an alarming late-cycle increase in problem loans, in a market are that wasn't hit anywhere near as hard from the credit crisis as Florida, Georgia, and California.2. Park Sterling Corp.Shares of Park Sterling Corp.  of Charlotte, N.C., closed at $4 Friday, down 35 percent year-to-date. Based on the consensus price target of $6.20, the shares have 55 percent upside potential.Park Sterling was formed on October 6, 2010, to serve as the holding company for Park Sterling Bank, which was chartered in September 2008.The company is rapidly expanding, and \xe2\x80\x94 as is typical for a ""de novo"" bank \xe2\x80\x94 has not yet achieved consistent profits.On Nov 1. Park Sterling completed its acquisition of Community Capital Corp. of Greenwood, S.C., to double the company's size to $1.2 billion, with 22 branches. James Perry remains as Park Sterling's CEO, with Bill Stevens, the former CEO of Community Capital, remaining as the combined company's CEO for its South Carolina market area.Park Sterling reported a third-quarter net loss of $1.4 million, or 5 cents a share, improving from losses of $3.1 million, or 11 cents a share the previous quarter, and $3.7 million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier.KBW analyst Jefferson Harralson on Nov. 3 reiterated his ""outperform"" or ""buy"" rating for Park Sterling, with a $5.60 price target, saying he would expect the company to continue leveraging its excess capital by announcing ""its next deal within the next six months."" The consensus among analysts is for Park Sterling to swing to post a fourth-quarter net loss of 2 cents a share, followed by earnings of 2 cents a share in 2012.All three analysts covering Park Sterling rate the shares a ""buy.""1. Popular Inc.Shares of Popular, Inc. , of Hato Rey, Puerto Rico, closed at $1.75 Friday, declining 44 percent year-to-date.

Third-quarter provisions increased because the company on September 29 ""completed the sale of construction and commercial real estate loans with an unpaid principal balance and net book value of approximately $358 million and $128 million, respectively,"" the majority of which were nonperforming loans.Following the earnings announcement, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Michael Diana reiterated his ""buy"" rating on Popular, raising his price target for the shares to $2.50 from $2.25.All five analysts covering Popular rate the shares a ""buy.""______________________________CNBC Data Pages:Dow 30 Stocks\xe2\x80\x94In Real Time Oil, Gold, Natural Gas Prices Now Where's the US Dollar Today?Track Treasury Prices Here______________________________ Disclosures:TheStreet's editorial policy prohibits staff editors, reporters and analysts from holding positions in any individual stocks.Disclaimer",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/08/five-bank-stock-picks-under-5.html

This narrative has been revived in a paper published in the fall issue of Brookings Papers on Economic Activity by two economists from the University of Chicago, Erik Hurst and Benjamin Pugsley.?Hurst and Pugsley are right to question the growth potential of the small business sector taken as a whole. But their paper and its implicit endorsement of bigness is being misconstrued by a growing number of commentators. ?As a significant body of research has shown, it is not small business that drives the creation of new jobs or even major productivity advances, but new business.

128,Euro Still Locked in Consolidation But We Look for Renewed Weakness,Currency Contest,08-11-2011,"Although the problems in Greece are far from resolved at this point, it seems as though market participants have shifted their focus elsewhere, with Italy now in the spotlight. The fear of contagion is becoming a major reality and with Italian bond yields widening to record levels, today\xe2\x80\x99s parliamentary budget vote will be critical. Bond spreads in Italy have now widened out to levels which the UK Telegraph reminds could very well result in margin requirement adjustments, and this in turn would unleash a fresh wave of systemic risk. We therefore continue to project additional weakness in the Euro and other risk correlated currencies going forward and would expect the US Dollar to be the primary beneficiary of these flows. Look for a break in Eur/Usd below 1.3680 on Tuesday to strengthen outlook, while back below 1.3605 will confirm and accelerate declines. Rallies are expected to remain well capped below 1.3870. Elsewhere, the Australian Dollar continues to show relative weakness, with the risk off market environment and some more disappointing economic data weighing on the higher yielding currency. Monday\xe2\x80\x99s softer ANZ job ads reading has been followed up on Tuesday with some disheartening trade data.\xc2\xa0 Meanwhile in the UK, industrial and manufacturing production numbers were on the whole better than expected, which helped to prop the Pound against most currencies intraday. The Swiss Franc also continued to generate attention, with SNB Jordan opening some profit taking in Eur/Chf after warning that it is wrong to engage in competitive devaluation.

130,Newt Gingrich: Restoring Booming Economic Growth to America ,Republican Debate GOP Debate 2011,08-11-2011,"Since the Great Depression, recessions in America before this last one have lasted an average of 10 months. The longest previously has been 16 months. But here we are 46 months after the last recession started, and there is still no real recovery.We are instead suffering the longest period with unemployment at 8.5% or above since the Great Depression. Real wages and family incomes are persistently falling. More Americans are in poverty today than at any time since the Census Bureau began keeping records on it over 50 years ago. President Obama and his administration have tried to blame the persistent unemployment and economic stagnation on the severity of the recession they inherited. However, the historical record shows us that the deeper the recession the stronger the recovery. America should at worst be finishing the second year of a booming recovery by now. We know how to create economic growth. Ronald Reagan did it, with arguably worse circumstances than today: double digit inflation, double digit unemployment and double digit interest rates. We did it when I was Speaker of the House, when the American people created 11 million new jobs in four years. Returning to these principles would restore another economic boom within a year. My plan for the restoration of traditional, booming, American economic growth is straight from the same playbook that worked during Ronald Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s presidency and during my term as Speaker. It begins with reducing tax rates to maximize incentives for increased production, job creation, and prosperity. America today suffers from virtually the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world, nearly 40% on average counting state corporate rates.

166,"For Goldman, Trading Losses on 21 Days in Third Quarter ",U.S. News,09-11-2011,"It is no secret that Goldman Sachs had a rough third quarter. In a regulatory filing on Wednesday, it disclosed just how rough, reporting trading losses on 21 days in the period.On one of those down days the firm\xe2\x80\x99s traders lost more than $100 million, but the firm also reported that trading gains exceeded $100 million on nine days, according to the quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In contrast, in the period a year earlier it lost revenue on just two days and earned more than $75 million in trading revenue on 31 separate days. The third quarter is one Goldman executives would rather forget. Hit by losses in its private equity portfolio and broader economic woes at home and abroad, the firm reported a loss of $428 million. That compares with a $1.7 billion profit in the third quarter of 2010, and it represents only the second quarterly loss for Goldman since it went public in 1999. In the quarterly filing, the investment bank also disclosed that it reined in its value at risk, a yardstick of how large a loss could be posted in one trading day. Average daily value at risk was $102 million in the quarter, down from $121 million in the period a year earlier and roughly the same as in the second quarter.

The European debt crisis is foremost in many investors\xe2\x80\x99 minds, and the Goldman filing also provided details about its total short-term exposure to some countries. The company said it had $23.8 billion in exposure to France, $24.4 billion to Germany and $7.6 billion to Ireland. This is not credit risk, but rather the total unhedged loss that Goldman could experience if its holdings were to get stuck in these countries.

171,Eurozone Fears Intensify to Trigger Break of Recent Consolidation,Currency Contest,09-11-2011,"We are finally starting to see movement in the markets following a period of consolidation over the past several days, and as we suspected, the break in the price action has been in the US Dollar\xe2\x80\x99s favor on a fresh wave of risk liquidation. Market participants are once again very concerned with the developments in the Eurozone and today it has been the widening in Italian bond spreads and concurrent actions by the LCH to raise charges on Italian bonds that has opened the door for some broad based selling of currencies.Naturally it is the higher yielding currencies that have been hit the hardest as a result, and the Australian Dollar stand out as the gross underperformer. Also seen weighing on sentiment has been news that the ECB had tapped its overnight loan facility, and comments from Fitch that say European investors see the risk of a double dip recession tripling since the second quarter of this year. Despite some highly concerning trade data out of the UK, which also showed wider revisions to the previous print, the Pound has managed to post gains against most of the other currencies with the risk liquidation theme taking precedence over any disheartening local fundamentals.Indeed, the Yen has managed to find some renewed bids in recent trade as well, but following a significant round of MOF intervention in the previous week, we suspect that any Yen bids will be easily absorbed ahead of a fresh bout of Yen weakness (ie USD/JPY higher). Look for the current round of setbacks in Usd/Jpy to be well supported in the 77.00\xe2\x80\x99s, with only a daily close back below 77.00 to negate outlook.Looking ahead, the economic calendar for Wednesday is rather light, with Canada housing data and US wholesale inventories as the only notable releases.

185,What the Deficit Supercommittee Could Do to the Dollar,Money in Motion,09-11-2011,"Think the European debt crisis is roiling the markets? Wait until investors start focusing on the deficit SWAT team.Until this morning, the euro  was more or less holding up despite the turmoil in Europe, and that has flummoxed some investors. Mark McCormick, a strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman has a reason for the robustness: the deep divisions on the deficit supercommittee.McCormick says markets are pricing in only a 7% probability that the supercommittee will reach a deal by its November 23 deadline. And if they don't, that means $1.2 trillion in discretionary spending cuts. Why should currency investors care? Because that kind of tight fiscal policy, combined with sluggish economic growth, could push the Federal Reserve to be more accommodative. And ""standard macro economic framework for currency analysis indicates restrictive fiscal policy, together with expansionary monetary, on average, tends to lead to domestic currency weakness,"" McCormick wrote in a note to clients. In essence, no deal means no dollar strength.\xc2\xa0 McCormick and his colleagues still expect the euro to hit 1.29 against the dollar by the end of the year, given all the troubles there. But if the supercommittee can't get itself together, and the cuts ensue, ""you'd have the economy contracting and low relative interest rates, and that's basically toxic for a currency,"" he told me. The British pound,  the euro and the dollar might ""still be fighting it out for the ugly contest,"" he adds, so the dollar might not weaken so much against those two. But McCormick says it's quite possible that peripheral G10 currencies would nicely outperform the dollar.Just something to keep in mind in case you don't have enough currency news to chew over right now.

192,Eddie Murphy Drops Out of Oscars Telecast ,Companies,09-11-2011,"Eddie Murphy is dropping out as the host of the Oscars telecast, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences said Wednesday, less than 24 hours after the show\xe2\x80\x99s producer Brett Ratner stepped aside amid a storm of criticism over his use of an anti-gay slur over the weekend. The hasty departures represented an embarrassing collapse of the Academy\xe2\x80\x99s plans for the Oscar presentation and left it with just over three months to fill key roles for one of the most elaborately staged television shows of the year. Mr. Ratner, who was named the Oscar co-producer on Aug. 4, resigned on Tuesday morning because of the furor over anti-gay slur and a subsequent, salacious discussion of his own sexual habits on Howard Stern\xe2\x80\x99s radio program on Sirius XM Radio show. The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation strongly objected to the derisive remark about gays, and a flood of objections by academy members and media commentators quickly made clear that the Academy\xe2\x80\x99s Feb. 26 Oscar show on ABC , if Mr. Ratner remained in charge, was going to be as much about Mr. Ratner as the movies. Mr. Murphy on Wednesday followed Mr. Ratner \xe2\x80\x94 his friend, and the director of his latest film \xe2\x80\x9cTower Heist\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 out the door. ""I appreciate how Eddie feels about losing his creative partner, Brett Ratner, and we all wish him well,"" Tom Sherak, the president of the academy, said in a statement. On Tuesday evening, Mr. Sherak tried to salvage something by casting Mr. Ratner\xe2\x80\x99s resignation as a teachable moment. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is our sincere belief \xe2\x80\x94 as well as Brett\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 that this terrible event may ultimately raise awareness and yield some good,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Sherak wrote in an email sent directly to the academy\xe2\x80\x99s approximately 6,000 members. In an industry where relationships often fracture quickly, Mr. Ratner\xe2\x80\x99s connection to the show at least lasted longer than Kim Kardashian\xe2\x80\x99s marriage (by 24 days), But if the Academy is squinting for a silver lining, it might find another bright spot. With Mr. Ratner and Mr. Murphy moving on, the academy and its governors get another shot, sooner rather than later, at rebooting an annual ritual that still draws around 40 million viewers in the United States (and many more abroad), and remains one of television\xe2\x80\x99s biggest events, despite a widespread sense that it is losing its connection with an audience that wants to love it. Mr. Ratner was to co-produce the show with Don Mischer, a past Oscar producer who remains in place. Though plans for the program were still being formed, the two producers had made clear that they intended to bring an extra-heavy dollop of comedy \xe2\x80\x94 hence Mr. Murphy\xe2\x80\x94 to a ceremony that might not have looked much different than the variety show-style ceremonies of years past. Whether that approach will endure with Mr. Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s exit is unclear. ",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/09/eddie-murphy-drops-out-of-oscars-telecast.html

196,Jim Cramer's 4 Earnings to Watch Wednesday,Mad Money,08-11-2011,"There are dozens of companies scheduled to report earnings on Wednesday, but Jim Cramer plans to monitor four companies' results in particular.To start, General Motors  will announce its earnings before the opening bell. While last month\xe2\x80\x99s sales were disappointing, the automaker has a \xe2\x80\x9ctruly gigantic cash flow.\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer would rather take the over than the under here and just view it as a play on China\xe2\x80\x99s soft landing. Ralph Lauren  also reports ahead of the open and Cramer is urging caution. People are expecting a great deal and the bar may be too high, he said. After the closing bell, Cisco  releases its earnings. According to highly regarded Wall Street technician Dan Fitzpatrick the chart is great, so Cramer\xe2\x80\x99s wondering if they can deliver. They seem to have regained the momentum, he said, and now is the seasonal sweet spot for tech.There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot on the line for Green Mountain Coffee  when it reports after the bell. This is the chance for GMCR to rebut all of David Einhorn\xe2\x80\x99s charges against the company, and Cramer's eager to hear what it has to say. He thinks Green Mountain needs to be forceful that margins are going higher and it can take on any competitors. Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

For the last three quarters, \xe2\x80\x9cgovernmental regulations/intervention\xe2\x80\x9d have accounted for less than 1 percent of layoffs. As for hiring, one reason to believe that a lack of consumer demand, rather than regulations, is discouraging employers is that businesses are not even fully using their existing staff and equipment. If regulatory requirements were so burdensome but the demand was there, companies would most likely step up their use of what they already had on hand.

Also looking strong: Oil and gas companies. Cramer turned the spotlight on Cabot Oil & Gas, Range Resources and Pioneer Natural Resources, whose stock prices soared. EOG, too, was up nicely today, and remained a relative bargain. Schlumberger and National Oilwell Varco , too, were among the day\xe2\x80\x99s big winners. Ho, Ho, Kohl\xe2\x80\x99s ...Ahead of the holidays, retail also sprang to life. \xe2\x80\x9cKohl's  reminds us that investing solely on the basis of actual earnings and prospects in here America when, alas, a company operates only in America, can still make sense,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. \xe2\x80\x9cI'm always thrilled when Kohl's does well because I love shopping there, but for the slacks and for the two for $40 shirts that I can wear on the show and then throw away after a couple of wearings.\xe2\x80\x9d Other companies \xe2\x80\x94 what Cramer calls \xe2\x80\x9cthe non-complainers\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 were largely able to shrug off the Italian debt crisis. Cummins, Caterpillar and Rockwell Automation were three such plays, although day-to-day swings could hurt. Viacom, with excellent numbers, \xe2\x80\x9cdeclared a buyback so huge that it could actually be the beginning of a going-private situation \xe2\x80\x94 again,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. Last and certainly not least, take a look at Merck. An 11 percent dividends boost and management\xe2\x80\x99s conviction that the Schering-Plough acquisition is working are good signs, even if the company doesn\xe2\x80\x99t return to its former glory. \xe2\x80\x9cOf the large capitalization drug companies, I still prefer Sanofi for its similarly terrific yield and its avoidance of the dreaded patent cliff,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. Also worth keeping tabs on: Celgene, which heads into an important conference \xe2\x80\x9cwhere some fantastic data will be revealed.\xe2\x80\x9d Now, the stinkers. Once a high-flying favorite, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters imploded with a 38.99 percent drop. The result? Other darlings of mutual and hedge funds looking for growth regardless of cost were reexamined. Other possible casualties, Cramer said, might be Wynn, the casino company; Google, which received terrific publicity in The New York Times; and, yes, Apple, which must deal with too many tablets, too much competition. Ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99ll pay to stay aware of dividends and remember who can make money in this miserable era, even in Europe.

227,USD to Extend Gains Across Board on Broad Risk Liquidation,Currency Contest,10-11-2011,"The US Dollar has finally come out on top following a multi-day consolidation and gains have been accelerating into the European open on Thursday. We had seen some violent corrective selling in the month of October, and November has brought with it a resumed favorable outlook for the buck. G10 currencies (Yen exception) were hit hard on Wednesday, and the higher yielding currencies were the most exposed in the negative sentiment, risk liquidation market environment. Kiwi has been one of the hardest hit on the day thus far, with the commodity currency finding some relative weakness on some softer economic data and downbeat comments from RBNZ Bollard and FinMin English. The Australian Dollar now looks like it could be on the verge of establishing back below parity and we are pleased with the price action given our short Aussie exposure via the US Dollar and Euro.Looking ahead, the key event risk on the day comes in the form of the Bank of England rate decision, although no change is expected on asset purchases or interest rates. As such, most of the price action and direction will be heavily influenced by ongoing developments in the Eurozone, with Greece and Italy dominating headlines. A UK Guardian piece hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been helping matters, after reporting that Germany and France have begun talks to consider the breakup of the Eurozone on fear of contagion to the core economy. We highly doubt there is any legitimate realty to this actually occurring, but at the same time recognize the effect such a report can have. Fear is the ultimate market mover and this type of report and rumors of reduced bank exposures, along with record wide bond yields on the peripherals, all contribute to fear of mass contagion and systemic risk that ultimately have the potential to suck any risk out of the global macro markets. It is also worth noting that geopolitical risk has crept back into play with Iran in the headlines on an IEA report that the country is looking at ways to deliver a nuclear warhead.\xc2\xa0 ",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/10/usd-to-extend-gains-across-board-on-broad-risk-liquidation.html

243,Yoshikami: When Investing\xe2\x80\x94Short and Long-Term Matter ,The Guest Blog,10-11-2011,"It's a time honored tradition in the investment community to tell investors to ""hang in there, you're a long-term investor"". While there is an element of truth to this statement, it is not particularly comforting when markets are volatile in the short term environment. The consternation that investors feel when portfolios fluctuate is palpable. It's the age-old dilemma that investors face; short or long-term thinking when investing a portfolio. Of course, the answer is both. With the market plummeting in September and bouncing back in October, it\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder investors struggle with investment decisions. And now with Italy moving into the headlines, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to lose focus. Look at fluctuations in Apple , Amazon , and just about everything else. It boggles the mind to watch the whipsaw; here\xe2\x80\x99s how we invest based on current circumstances. You might find this helpful as you invest your portfolio. Start with a long-term view focused on overall goals, comfort level, and willingness to tolerate fluctuation. Examines the future cash flow of positions and assign a target price to each of the assets you buy. It\xe2\x80\x99s important that you set a target price for your positions. You need a thematic view of the world (especially THIS world). Your tactical weightings should reflect our views of where the world economy and macro environment is headed. This may mean the overweight a certain region or adjusting the duration of fixed income assets. It may mean underweighting a particular sector or focus that you believe benefit from sector tailwinds. Focus these trend adjustments for a 3 to 5 year time horizon. But this is not to say that the short-term should be ignored. Short-term judgments on assets when market anomalies occur that allow for the opportunity to capture opportunity. For example, if a company misses earnings that you like and has a strong reaction downward in price, that can obviously provide a buying opportunity This is a short-term decision based on a short-term price movement; a trading play. This is not to say that you automatically buy more when assets have dropped in value; that's not the case. Likewise, if a position moves towards your target price, don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid to sell. Yes tax hurts, but profit is the game. Lean in one direction rather than making black-and-white judgments. The market moves too fast and is too unpredictable in an age of excess emotion and fast trading computers to make all or nothing decisions. Lean and allocate towards your inclinations; overweight or underweight certain areas of the market or reduce/increase asset classes. A combination of short and long-term strategy will give you the highest probability of success. It's a strategy that we believe provide the opportunity for growth as well as help you design a survivable portfolio allocation if conditions become uncertain.

Foreclosures, falling home prices, negative equity, nil consumer confidence, record low home building...yep, gotta be Dodd-Frank. ""If the Republican House next week would repeal Dodd-Frank and allow us to put pressure on the Senate to repeal Dodd-Frank, you would see the housing market start to improve overnight,"" Speaker Newt Gingrich told the crowd in Michigan last night.

Increased regulation has certainly made the life of a banker today tougher, but the fact that there was zero regulation ten years ago allowed and encouraged reckless behavior on Wall Street.

266,Rick Santorum: The Iranian Threat,The Guest Blog,10-11-2011,"We know the world changed on 9/11, but we didn't think it would change again so soon. With the news that Iran is literally weeks away from becoming a nuclear power, the game has changed once again. A little over 5 years ago during an interview on Meet the Press, the late Tim Russert asked me what was the greatest threat to American security. We had been at war in Afghanistan for nearly five years and at war in Iraq for over three. Thousands of our bravest had already given what Lincoln poignantly described as the \xe2\x80\x9clast full measure of devotion.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet there I sat, making the case Iran poses the greatest threat to our security. I said \xe2\x80\x98Iran\xe2\x80\x99 because they have been at war with America since 1979. Iran has been a leading funder of Hezbollah \xe2\x80\x93 who is the provider of the most deadly weapon used against our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, Improvised Explosive Devices or I.E.D\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x93 and complicit in the training of al-Qaeda. Most recently, it was uncovered that Iran sought to assassinate the Saudi ambassador on U.S. soil \xe2\x80\x93 an unprecedented power play directed at becoming the preeminent Middle East power while at the same time showing complete disdain and disregard for \xe2\x80\x93 what they call, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Great Satan\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 America. The parallels between 1980\xe2\x80\x99s Soviet Union aggression and the aggression of this Iran are shockingly similar: an aggressive, expansionist ideology; projecting regional power and causing military mischief; creating alignments in our hemisphere, including support of militant and terror organizations that can penetrate our homeland. However, there are almost no parallels between how we dealt with the Soviet Union and how we need to deal with Iran. Reason being, mutually assured destruction worked to keep the cold war cold. Russia was an atheistic enemy who didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in an afterlife. In this case, history proves self destruction is no deterrent for Iran. In fact, the Islamists ruling Iran view dying for its cause will be rewarded in the afterlife. There are those in Iran\xe2\x80\x99s ruling elite who use religious theology as justification for building a nuclear weapon. Some even believe that bringing about great worldly chaos that would certainly occur with the destruction of Israel, would usher in the rule of the 12th Imam \xe2\x80\x93 or Islamic religious Savior. This week\xe2\x80\x99s report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) now shows that these radical Islamists are on the verge of having a nuclear weapon that could allow them to do just that. The most tragic part is we could have avoided this escalation. While in the senate serving on the Armed Services Committee, I warned repeatedly of the threat that a nuclear Iran would be, and urged steps to avoid it becoming one. As the IAEA\xe2\x80\x99s report indicates, my predictions were unfortunately right. ",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/10/rick-santorum-the-iranian-threat.html

276,Jim Cramer's Top High-Yielding Stocks,Mad Money,09-11-2011,"For investors looking for protection from a chaotic market environment, Cramer on Wednesday outlined his top high-yielding stocks.Windstream : This rural telco provider's stock sports an 8.5 percent dividend yield. While Windstream's wire-line phone business is in decline, the company has been focusing on areas of growth, such as broadband and business services. Of Cramer's top high-yielding stocks, he said Windstream's dividend is the least safe, even though it has enough free cash flow to cover the payout. For investors looking for a safer play, though, he suggests Verizon .Solar Capital : This specialty lender's stock pays a massive 10.7 percent dividend yield. Cramer would typically view a yield that high as a red flag, but this is a special case. As a business development company, Solar Capital lends money to small- and medium-sized companies that are too tiny or risky for most people to invest in. Solar Capital then returns 90 percent of its profits to shareholders by way of a huge dividend, Cramer explained. He likes the stock at current levels.Energy Transfer Partners : This pipeline master limited partnership yields 8.3 percent. Cramer thinks of this company as a ""steady toll operator for moving oil and gas around."" Thanks to recent oil and gas discoveries, demand for new pipe has skyrocketed, benefitting ETP. Some investors are upset that the company did a massive stock offering that knocked its stock price down, but Cramer sees it as an opportunity to get shares at discount. American Electric Power : This utility company is committed to paying out higher dividends, Cramer said, and the stock already has a 4.9 percent dividend yield. American Electric Power is one of the U.S.'s top generators of electricity and has the country's largest transmission system. Cramer prefers this utility to others, though, because he thinks its utility portfolio is among the strongest in the country and it provides power to the ""Heartland"" where manufacturing is ""very strong.""Sanofi : This drug company pays a 5.4 percent dividend yield. Cramer likes Sanofi because it's a defensive play that doesn't need a growing economy for business to be good. In addition, it has the lowest exposure to Medicare of any big pharma company. So any potential cuts U.S. lawmakers make to the program are less of a concern. Meanwhile, the company is moving into faster growing areas, such as vaccines, diabetes, generics and more.Read on for Cramer's Top Dividend Stocks 2011",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/09/jim-cramers-top-highyielding-stocks.html

Here's one strategist's reason why.What with political upheaval in Italy and Greece and France and Germany have even been actively discussing a smaller euro zone, Europe is indisputably in crisis. But like the friendly train in The Little Engine That Could, the euro  just keeps going and going. Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon, says it's really not about the euro at all. Noting that the single currency ""still remains significantly above the lows seen in early October and a full 14% higher than it did in June of last year,"" Derrick says, ""We certainly do not see this as a vote of confidence in the single currency but, rather, as measure of a growing loss of confidence in the USD  itself as a store of value.""Derrick told me he expects growing clarity about new leadership in Italy and Greece will help to calm markets, and says downward pressure on the dollar is likely to grow, thanks to current Fed policy. But don't be too quick to buy euros against the buck: ""I'm not convinced right now that there is a huge amount of downside to EUR/USD,"" he told me, but ""That said, Euro zone politicians have made an art of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory over the past couple of years.""Tune In: CNBC's ""Money in Motion Currency Trading"" airs on Fridays at 5:30pm and repeats on Saturdays at 7pm.

281,Can Big Business Save Japan's Fishing Industry?,Business News,09-11-2011,"When a 9.0 earthquake struck northern Japan in March, Yukihiro Osawa felt prepared. Like most fishermen in his village on Miyagi Prefecture\xe2\x80\x99s Oshika Peninsula, he docked two of his boats on a nearby island where they would be sheltered from the coming tsunami.\xc2\xa0 He then hurried to shelter, and looked out to sea.\xe2\x80\x9cI could see the tsunami over the top of the island, and I said to myself, this is gonna be a bad one,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Osawa.He was right. When the waters calmed, his two boats were all that remained of his fishing and aquaculture business that had previously employed about 15 people. Replacing what he lost will cost 40 to 50 million yen, nearly $600,000 dollars, he estimates. He\xe2\x80\x99s determined to rebuild his business by next year, but a recent proposal by the local government in an effort to save the industry as a whole could hurt his business and change the industry altogether in the process.Miyagi Governor Yoshihiro Murai says he doesn't think older, smaller-scale fishermen will be able to recover even with government help. So, in what he says is an effort to salvage the billion dollar industry, he has proposed opening coastal waters \xe2\x80\x93 long restricted to independent fishermen belonging to Fisheries Cooperative Associations \xe2\x80\x93 to big-business investors.The proposal has drawn harsh criticism from the fishing cooperatives who say it's just a move to pander to big business and fear they will be pushed out of the market. And many academics argue that the proposed system would expose coastal communities and ecosystems to exploitation and abandonment.\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t need this,\xe2\x80\x9d says Osawa, who fears large companies would easily undersell him.Under fisheries law enacted in 1948 and amended in the 60s, cooperatives have preferential access to coastal fishing rights, which they distribute to their members. Nearly all commercial fishermen belong to a cooperative in Japan. Outside investors can get involved by forming partnerships with fishermen or by claiming leftover fishing rights.Mr. Murai has petitioned the central government to designate a special fishing zone where companies would have the same access to fishing licenses as cooperatives.A little less than half of Japan's roughly $3 billion in annual food exports comes from seafood. But even before the tsunami struck, cooperatives nationwide were plagued by shrinking membership, financial troubles, and declining fish stocks.Masahiro Yamao, a fisheries expert at Hiroshima University\xe2\x80\x99s Graduate School of Biosphere Science, says the Miyagi proposal is a test case for a larger restructuring of the struggling fishing industry. Miyagi officials say investment from outside businesses is crucial now because the extent of the damage is so extreme.\xc2\xa0 Norimitsu Kobayashi, technical director of the Miyagi Fisheries Recovery Department, has the numbers to support the government\xe2\x80\x99s claims. Ninety percent of boats were destroyed in the tsunami, all 142 fishing ports were damaged, there was $25 million in damages to aquaculture, and $2.5 billion to processing facilities.According to an April United Nations report, ""Considering that agriculture and fisheries are one of the biggest industries in Tohoku Region, reconstruction of these sectors ... will be critical for the reconstruction of livelihoods.""On top of that, 60 percent of Miyagi\xe2\x80\x99s fishermen are over the age of 50, and in one survey 30 percent said they plan to quit the business because of the tsunami.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s really hard for people in their 60s and 70s to start over again,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Kobayashi says. If large companies set up coastal fishing businesses, they could hire local fishermen as salaried workers who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t need to buy their own boats.But Mr. Yamao, the fisheries expert, sees a risk in inviting big businesses into the local fishing industry. In Japan, marine resource management is left nearly entirely to the local cooperatives, which regulate net size, fishing periods, and other aspects of the industry.\xe2\x80\x9cLocals have been here for generations managing the resources,\xe2\x80\x9d says Yamao. \xe2\x80\x9cThe priority for a corporation is profit. If there\xe2\x80\x99s no profit, they leave.\xe2\x80\x9dA new framework would be necessary to prevent overfishing, should big companies get involved outside the existing system, says Michael Clark, a Fishery Management Specialist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\xe2\x80\x9cUS fishing laws start and end with a quota for most species, so it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if you\xe2\x80\x99re a mom-and-pop operation or a big company. [But] Japan only has quotas for seven out of hundreds of species,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Clark, who spent a year in Japan studying the fishing industry as a 2008-2010 Mansfield fellow.\xe2\x80\x9c[The Miyagi plan] would affect the whole country,\xe2\x80\x9d says Yamao. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s caused so much conflict between fishermen and the government that it\xe2\x80\x99s become an obstacle to reconstruction.\xe2\x80\x9d According to a recent poll by the Asahi Shimbun, the second most circulated newspaper in Japan, Miyagi residents are divided on the proposal. Fishing cooperatives officials said that even their members can\xe2\x80\x99t agree if inviting big corporations in is a good idea or not.There are other approaches to dealing with the suffering fishing industry. Neighboring Iwate Prefecture, which endured damage nearly as extreme as Miyagi\xe2\x80\x99s, does not plan to request a similar exception to the fisheries law, but instead will funnel national and prefectural recovery funds through existing cooperatives to spur recovery.Fukushima Prefecture has halted all coastal fishing due to the nuclear disaster and has not yet drafted a recovery plan.Meanwhile, despite government proposals, fishermen have plans of their own.On a Sunday in September about 150 people from Tokyo and other distant cities gathered on a fishing pier in Ogatsu, Miyagi Prefecture, to help tie seed oysters to ropes and suspend them in the bay. The visitors each paid 10,000 yen, about $130, to join the fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s version of a community supported agriculture business.The up-front investment will pay for boats and other equipment. Investors will eventually be paid back in oysters, scallops, and salmon by the 10 fishermen and two marketing specialists who own the business. Company president Hiromi Ito says it\xe2\x80\x99s the first business of its kind in Japan.\xe2\x80\x9cBecause we have this, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine even if big corporations come in,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. For many other small-scale fishermen in Japan, the future is unfortunately much less certain.",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/09/can-big-business-save-japans-fishing-industry.html

298,Farr: What Happened to Greece? ,The Guest Blog,11-11-2011,"Headlines are filled with Italian bond yieldsand the status of Italy\xe2\x80\x99s economy. Berlusconi has declared the economy is in fine shape because the restaurants are full. No surprise that he is on the way out. US share prices are rallying on a vote approving austerity measures by the Italian Parliament. Weren\xe2\x80\x99t we just obsessing about Greece and Papandreou? What happened to Greece? They didn\xe2\x80\x99t get fixed, but the gnat-like attention span of markets has shifted once again.I wonder what it will be next week. Prices plunge on European worries and rally on promises of short-term fixes. Is this any way to run a railroad? It seems like a perilous environment for investing. If you knew that a European Sovereign debt default would certainly be avoided next week, would you buy calls or puts and for what time period? It is all very murky and unpredictable. A client called last week and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not panicked; I\xe2\x80\x99m just exhausted.\xe2\x80\x9d He wanted to sell a portion of his account to get back to the point where he could sleep at night. It struck me that all of the volatility and uncertainty has raised the cash level for sleeping for a lot of investors. It will likely prove wrong as most emotional decisions usually do, but I have to agree with the sentiment: these daily swings of several hundreds of points are wearing thin. My new book ""The Arrogance Cycle""analyzes emotional decisions of individuals and of society. Knowing yourself will alert you to many dangers ahead. Just when you\xe2\x80\x99re sure you can\xe2\x80\x99t lose, you better think again. Stepping back from the noise, shows Europe in an awful mess that will quite likely lead to recession. Europe is a significant US trading partner. As Europe suffers a contraction, our economy will certainly feel the pressure, and we will approach stall speed. Whether or not we actually stall matters mostly to statisticians. Whether we technically flunk or get by with a D-, does not bode well for our future academic success. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen or studied any periods similar to this one. Global markets are connected and inter-woven in ways they never have been before. The banking systems share common plumbing that suffer common clogs. Without a clear view of the innumerable significant news events affecting outcomes in the market place, playing defense remains our most sound strategy. We will always prefer missing opportunity over missing principal. Solid balance sheets with limited leverage, good dividends, and high returns on equity are our preference. Michael K.

366,Europe\xe2\x80\x99s Banks Turned to Safe Bonds and Found Illusion,Europe News,11-11-2011,"As the bets that European banks made on United States mortgage investments went bust a few years ago, bankers piled into what they saw as a safe refuge: bonds issued by countries in Europe\xe2\x80\x99s seemingly ironclad monetary union.Now, the political and financial crisis engulfing the Continent has turned much of that European sovereign debt into the latest distressed asset, sending tremors through global financial markets not seen since the demise of the investment bank Lehman Brothers more than three years ago.This week, shortly after European leaders formally conceded that Greece could not pay its debts and forced banks to accept losses, the shock waves reached Italy, the third-largest economy in the euro zone after France and Germany. And despite frantic efforts by politicians to contain the damage, market analysts said that France, one of the strongest countries in the euro zone, may soon feel the impact.\xe2\x80\x9cWhen people started buying more European sovereign debt, there was not a cloud in the sky,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yannis Stournaras, director of the Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research, based in Athens. Now, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis crisis is going to last because the perceptions of risk have changed dramatically.\xe2\x80\x9dEuropean banks face tens and possibly hundreds of billions of dollars in losses on loans to nations that use the euro. Worried about even greater losses if the crisis worsens, the banks have been scrambling to reduce their holdings of an investment that, like triple-A-rated subprime mortgage bonds, was once thought to be bulletproof.The French bank Soci\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 G\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9rale, for instance, this week marked down 333 million euros of its Greek sovereign debt holdings and in October slashed its exposure to that country to 575 million euros, from 2.4 billion euros at the beginning of 2011. Another French bank, BNP Paribas, has cut its holdings of Italian government debt 40 percent since July, to 12.2 billion euros.How European sovereign debt became the new subprime is a story with many culprits, including governments that borrowed beyond their means, regulators who permitted banks to treat the bonds as risk-free and investors who for too long did not make much of a distinction between the bonds of troubled economies like Greece and Italy and those issued by the rock-solid Germany.Banks had further incentive to overlook the perils of individual euro zone countries because of the fees they earned for underwriting sovereign debt sold to other investors. Since 2005, several dozen banks in Europe and the United States have earned $1.1 billion in fees from selling bonds for European governments, according to Thomson Reuters and Freeman Consulting Services.Like other investors, banks clung for a long time to the seemingly inviolable belief that all the countries using the euro would make good on their debts. For years, Greek and Italian bonds did not pay much more than German ones, but banks were always hungry to chase even a fraction of additional profit. For much of the last decade, they bought the higher-yield bonds, ignoring the growing political and fiscal problems of those countries as well as other peripheral euro zone nations like Ireland, Spain and Portugal.Regulators bear much of the responsibility. Before 1999, when Europe forged its monetary union, regulators permitted banks to treat as risk-free the debt of any country that belonged to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a club of developed nations that includes the United States and most of Europe.\xe2\x80\x9cThere was encouragement from European authorities for banks to load up on more debt, because it was seen as safe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicolas V\xc3\xa9ron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research firm in Brussels. \xe2\x80\x9cIn hindsight, it was unwise risk management.\xe2\x80\x9dSome regulators realized that allowing banks to set aside no capital for sovereign defaults could be a problem and moved to address it in a 2006 accord known as Basel 2. They mandated that big, complex banks use their own models to determine if individual countries were at risk and hold some capital against them. But the European Union never enforced the stiffer regime. And amid the subprime mortgage crisis, Europe\xe2\x80\x99s regulators added to the problem by demanding that banks hold more safe assets, much of it sovereign debt.As a result, banks were not discouraged from placing their most liquid assets \xe2\x80\x9cinto the worst possible government debt,\xe2\x80\x9d Achim Kassow, a former Commerzbank board member, wrote in a study published by the European Parliament.",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/11/europes-banks-turned-to-safe-bonds-and-found-illusion.html

If it passes, it should create a climate of greater stability and prudence.

381,Google's Big Amazon Problem,Tech Check,14-11-2011,"Don't look now, but Amazon is stealing Android from Google .Exhibit A: Amazon's Kindle Fire. It's a 7-inch tablet that runs Android, and it's practically guaranteed to be the best-selling Android tablet of the year, after being on shelves less than two months. (Reviews of the Fire hit the web today. It's available for sale this month.) Why does this matter? Mobile is a key part of Google's growth strategy, and Android is Google's most important mobile investment. Here's the strategy behind Google's approach with Android: Google pays to develop the guts of the Android OS, to market it, to put a fresh user interface on it and to develop an ecosystem of apps. In return, it expects hardware makers that use Android to build in Google services. Usually this isn't a problem. Because if hardware makers want to use any of Google's apps in Android \xe2\x80\x94 services like Mail, Maps, Calendar, even the Android Market for apps \xe2\x80\x94 they have to include all of them, and follow Google's rules about how they're used. Enter Amazon. Amazon doesn't need Google. So it has taken Android and built its own interface, apps, and marketplace on top of it. The Kindle Fire can still run Android apps -- but it's out of Google's control, and Amazon has more influence than Google over who gets profit from the platform. See the problem here? Google has spent a lot of time and money promoting Android, and now Amazon is swooping in and hijacking it. If you just look at the aggregate numbers for Android adoption, this isn't a problem. But for Google specifically? Google has paid to create Android and to market it, and to create services on top of it. If the Kindle Fire (and its inevitable descendants) are successful, Google will have to pay again to get its services on those devices. If you're a Google investor, that's not ideal.

384,Incubators Help Power Revival of the Startup,Global Entrepreneurship 2011,14-11-2011,"Years after the dotcom boom and bust, startups are once again getting a benevolent boost from business incubators and accelerators.  These breeding grounds for innovation and creativity reduce the risk of small business failures by offering everything from facilities and funding and to much-needed mentoring and marketing. While incubators work with entrepreneurs in the very early phases of development and may not have any time limits, accelerators work with later-stage companies that may have patent-worthy technology and often require a quicker turnaround.  Some incubators are non-profit government programs; others may be backed by chambers of commerce or academic-related associations. Accelerators, on the other hand, are backed by angel investors or venture capital firms looking for a small equity stake.  One of the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading startup accelerators, TechStars, founded by David Cohen, not only provides seed funding from more than 75 venture capital firms and angel investors, but also offers mentoring from top entrepreneurs. Started in 2006 in Boulder, Colo., the concept became so popular it spawned locations in Boston, New York City, and Seattle.In 2005 alone, the National Business Incubation Association estimates that North American incubators assisted more than 27,000 start-up companies that provided full-time employment for more than 100,000 workers and generated annual revenue of more than $17 billion.

385,Currency Trades for the Risk Averse,Money in Motion,14-11-2011,"Europe's political drama and downbeat economic indicators are making it a great time to be risk averse. Here's one way to trade with caution.Sure, there are plenty of times to take aggressive positions, but the strategists at Barclays Capital say that with the European crisis pushing global financial markets to ""a pivotal point,"" this definitely isn't one of them. The crisis could be resolved through more decisive action by the authorities and the European Central Bank, the strategists wrote in a note to clients, but ""it is easier said than done as the ECB will face political constraints in the near term."" So they are sticking to trading recommendations that are based on relative value.For example: --Sell the Swedish krona  against the British pound  at 0.0942, with a stop loss of 0.0945 and a target of 0.0920. The euro-krona pair ""has lagged the risk selloff last week, despite its high beta-to-risk properties,"" Barclays says, and the British pound has moved higher against the euro.  They expect the krona to weaken against the pound directly.--Buy the dollar  against the Swiss franc  right around 0.901 with a target of 0.930 and a stop at 0.892. ""Worsening euro area condition may prompt the Swiss National Bank to defend the floor against the euro, supporting USD/CHF,"" Barclays says. ""Alternatively, should events in the euro area surprise on the positive side, the value of the CHF as a safe haven should fall.""\xc2\xa0 --If you are willing to trade less liquid currencies, Barclays also suggests buying the Turkish lira  against the Hungarian forint.  at 127.5, with stop loss at 125.0 and a target of 135.0. ""The Turkish central bank has an inflation problem and the economy is growing at respectable pace (4%+) and thus has both the means and motivation to lean against currency weakness,"" say the Barclays strategists. In Hungary, meanwhile, there are ""greater de-leveraging risks from European banks.""Good luck out there.Tune In: CNBC's ""Money in Motion Currency Trading"" airs on Fridays at 5:30pm and repeats on Saturdays at 7pm.

386,The S.B.A. Says Its Culture Has Changed,Small Business,14-11-2011,"In a recent post about the incidence of fraud in federal contracting programs for small businesses, the Small Business Administration came in for some criticism from the agency\xe2\x80\x99s inspector general, Peggy E. Gustafson. Ms. Gustafson, whose office is independent from the rest of the agency, testified before Congress recently that the agency needed to \xe2\x80\x9cchange its culture\xe2\x80\x9d and become more aggressive in punishing contractors who misrepresent themselves as small companies in order to win government work.Joe Jordan, the agency\xe2\x80\x99s associate administrator for government contracting and business development, sees it differently. He thinks the criticisms are out of date. \xe2\x80\x9cThat may have been true two or three years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there is absolutely a culture throughout S.B.A. of ridding our programs of fraud, waste and abuse.\xe2\x80\x9d Government officials often try to disassociate themselves from the work of their predecessors, but Mr. Jordan does have some numbers on his side. He began by discussing suspension and debarment, a process for banning businesses from receiving government contracts, often permanently, in cases of fraud or other misconduct. This was in fact what the inspector general was referring to when she called for a culture change \xe2\x80\x94 agency employees, she told legislators, were reluctant to pull this trigger. Mr. Jordan argued that the shift had already occurred. ",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/14/the-sba-says-its-culture-has-changed.html
387,"Cramer Compares SuperValu, Whole Foods Market",Mad Money,14-11-2011,"Cramer on Monday compared and contrasted SuperValu and Whole Foods Market to determine which has the cheaper stock.SuperValu  is an $8 stock that trades at 6.5 times forward earnings. It seems cheap considering the average stock in the S&P 500 index trades at 12 times earnings. Whole Foods , on the other hand, is a $68 stock that trades at 26 times forward earnings. Although it may appear SuperValu is the least expensive name, Cramer said Whole Foods is actually the cheap one.How could this be? First, Cramer reminded viewers that the share price means nothing. Investors should look at the price-to-earnings multiple for a true comparison of which stock is least expensive. The price-to-earnings multiple, by the way, can be computed by taking the stock price and dividing it by next year's earnings estimates, as calculated by Wall Street analysts. The stock with the lowest multiple isn't always the cheapest stock, though.""When we're valuing stocks, we have a specific metric that compares the price to earnings multiple to the growth rate\xe2\x80\x94it's called the PEG ratio, and it's critical to understanding just how cheap or expensive a stock truly is,"" Cramer explained. ""To figure out the PEG ratio, you divide the multiple by the growth rate. It's that simple.""So SuperValu has a 1.8 long-term growth rate while Whole Foods has an 18 percent growth rate. When growth is factored in, SuperValu has a PEG of 3.48 and Whole Foods has a PEG of 1.44. So here we see that Whole Foods can be a lot cheaper than SuperValu.""Remember, we don't care about the dollar amount of a stock price,"" Cramer said. ""In this business it's perfectly reasonable that an $8 stock is much more expensive than a $68 stock, especially when the latters' growing and the former's just stuck in the mud.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/14/cramer-compares-supervalu-whole-foods-market.html

391,Warren Buffett Vs. Italian Bonds,Mad Money,14-11-2011,"Warren Buffett versus Italian bonds \xe2\x80\x94 it was a titanic match-up that would move the markets on Monday, but in the end, the rising bond yields in Italy caused U.S. stocks to end lower.Stocks have lately focused on headlines from Europe as traders react to the escalating sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone. Italian benchmark bond yields rose above 7 percent last week, a level that forced countries with a lower debt burden to seek bailouts. With debt of more than 2 trillion euros, Italy is considered too big to bail out. Yields on 10-year Italian debt rose to 6.76 percent on Monday.Investors then turned their attention to billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who told CNBC that his firm, Berkshire Hathaway , has purchased $10.7 billion worth of IBM stock this year. ""That was a total stunner,"" Cramer said. ""Buffett, who has historically eschewed tech, has put $10 billion to work in a company that has transformed itself from a somewhat unpredictable hardware business to a software and consulting business that sells hardware and has consistent cash flows, which is what attracted Buffett to Big Blue.""More importantly, Buffett laid out an optimistic course of action that suggests investors buy stocks of U.S.-based companies. Although Europe's debt woes are troubling, Buffett said the U.S. companies he's buying shares of would do just fine. His comments were enough to push the markets back up for a time, but Cramer said the problem is that Europe's problems aren't going to go away over night. Buffett appears on TV every once and a while, but investors see more news about how horrible Europe is every single day.The bottom line? Even as smart and powerful as Warren Buffett may be, he's only one person. Moreover, he's only on TV on occasion.

402,"Student Startup Debuts at NYSE to Win $25,000 ",Global Entrepreneurship 2011,14-11-2011,"The room erupted in applause, not just for the opening bell to commence trading on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, but for the promise of next generation entrepreneurs.Competing in the nationwide \xe2\x80\x9cMovers & Changers\xe2\x80\x9d competition, launched by NYSEand mtvU, the fresh-faced finalists will leave the trading floor with $25,000 in start-up money, and instant name recognition \xe2\x80\x93 at least among the other 149 contestants who didn\xe2\x80\x99t make the cut. And the winner is...a new website. But not just any website. ""Skillhub"" is the brainchild of two University of Pennsylvania seniors who both happened to intern at Google. .Their idea, they say, was a mutual ah-ha moment.   ""When Sushanth told me on Skype about his video-sharing website idea, I said hold on, and sent him an email of mock designs of a website \xe2\x80\x94 it was the exact same idea,"" said Karishma Shah of her now partner Sushanth Bhaskarabhatla.The website, comparable to ""indirect"" competitors Ebay or Craigslist, will instead specialize in tutoring skills, and expand what are typically localized connections to worldwide access.Serendipity, in this case, is backed by careful planning. ""Some skills are saturated markets, like language. We're not doing that,"" said Bhaskarabhatla. ""There is a demand for niche skills, which are really not captured by traditional platforms.""""My brother wanted to learn how to program iPhone apps in a week,"" added Shah. ""He needed a personal tutor. It's not something you can get on a website tutorial.""While today's win is a game changer for celebrating students, their judges \xe2\x80\x94 a panel of three successful, seasoned entrepreneurs\xe2\x80\x94 offered sobering advice. ""The easy part is the idea. You\xe2\x80\x99re all pumped up. The hard part is the execution,"" said Mark Cuban, Chairman of HDNet and owner of the Dallas Mavericks. For all of today\xe2\x80\x99s optimism, set to MtvU's hip-hop background music, the fact is these students will be entering an extremely competitive landscape dependent on a lackluster economy. Another judge, Alexandra Wilkis Wilson, co-founder of online luxury goods retailer Gilt Groupe, also offered tempered advice: \xe2\x80\x9cSeek out people who will tell you your idea is a bad idea. There are probably elements of your business model you haven\xe2\x80\x99t thought out. If you can anticipate naysayers, you can use that to your advantage.""The weight of Wilson's words is unintentionally illustrated. Gilt Groupe has yet to turn a profit in five years operation. The company has been able to count on inventory from luxury brands who were willing, during the recession, to sell their products at a deep discount. It is unclear, however, if luxury brands will continue to do this as the economy improves.At the same time, new markets are born every day, as supply meets demand. And the mantra from the judges is positive, and simple: avoid banks, who aren't lending anyway, and find a way to do it yourself. ""All the businesses I started, [I did] without raising a lot of money,"" said Cuban. ""Sweat equity is your time. The minute you take other people\xe2\x80\x99s money, the stakes are different. You have a lot more leeway with your time, and your sweat equity, as opposed to someone else\xe2\x80\x99s cash.\xe2\x80\x9d Do the students buy this line of logic?  ""With $25,000 we can start the website. We can do a beta launch, and test out our first round of customers. We're avoiding the banks,"" said SkillHub's Shah.

Patterson points out that the dinar is a managed currency, and ""the central bank keeps it steady at around 1,170 dinar per dollar."" Not only that, but there have been various scams involving the dinar of late. So how can you use currencies to trade on an Iraqi recovery?

420,Currencies Back Under Pressure in Early Week as Risk Liquidation Resumes,Currency Contest,14-11-2011,"Volatility could pick up into the new week following a few sessions of relatively quiet trade which saw the USD back under pressure a bit across the board. However, we continue to project additional broad based US Dollar strength going forward and would look for any weakness in the Greenback to be very well absorbed at current levels. Certainly, the ability for both the Greeks and Italians to resolve their political turmoil has helped to calm markets somewhat, but the formation of new governments in these countries hardly dismisses the unlimited amounts of debt problems in peripheral Eurozone nations and the potential threat of contagion to the core. This coupled with softer economic data in the region, widening bond spreads and reduced exposure to certain local banks continues to suggest that we could very well see additional risk liquidation going forward which ultimately is seen benefiting the buck.Let us also not forget what we believe will be the onset of a third phase of the global recession, with China, Australia, New Zealand and the emerging markets all expected to undergo a bout of relative underperformance (even against the Eurozone) in the near future. While these markets have managed to outperform as non-traditional safe-haven alternatives to the beleaguered US and Eurozone economies, the idea that these markets have been traded as safe-havens, and the notion that decoupling applies in these markets does not sit well with us. In fact, we have already begun to see a material slowdown in the Chinese economy, with the latest batch of weak data reaffirming our downbeat outlook for the country. Any slowdown in China will surely then have an impact on the highly correlated Australian Dollar, which in turn should also weigh on Kiwi, and then spill into the emerging markets as investors realize that these economies are also well exposed. The IMF and G7 have both been out recently warning that the global economy faces significant downside risks which will temper any upside in risk appetite.On the data front, we have seen some offsetting data out of New Zealand, with retail sales coming in better, while performances of services showed deterioration. The balanced data has been helping to keep Kiwi trading relatively flat on the day despite the risk environment. Elsewhere, in Switzerland, PPIs came in a little firmer, while Eurozone industrial production was a wash, with monthly data improving while yearly was disappointing.\xc2\xa0 Looking ahead, the economic calendar for the rest of Monday is empty with no data in North America.

Unfortunately, the 142-year old company hasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite perfected the hip art of social media marketing.As of 4pm ET, Heinz  was still responding to the pleas of some of its 850,000-plus page fans with the response: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are experiencing some technical difficulties with our Balsamic Ketchup tab. We are working to fix this as quickly as possible and will notify you when it is properly working. Thank you for your patience!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is my balsamic ketchup!?!\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded one passionate fan in a post. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you get the Balsamic Ketchup you promised on the 14th?\xe2\x80\x9d asked another. Heinz did not advertise the promotion for the special ketchup, which won\xe2\x80\x99t hit stores until December, but its vice president for U.S. retail brands was quoted in a Sunday New York Times piece about it on Oct. 25. The company added about 35,000 fans to its Facebook page since that story ran as word of mouth spread on the social network.Heinz, founded in 1869 in Pittsburgh, is now a giant food conglomerate with $10.5 billion in annual sales and products such as SmartOnes, Ore-Ida and Bagel Bites on store shelves. However, Ketchup and sauces are still the No 1. source of the company\xe2\x80\x99s revenue. Heinz has been resistant to mess with its biggest brand, usually made with white vinegar. Only recently did the company start offering so-called Dip & Squeeze single-serve packages in restaurants and supermarkets, offering an alternative to its infamous small packets.\xe2\x80\x9cWe are excited to announce the launch of our Limited Edition Heinz\xc2\xae Tomato Ketchup with Balsamic Vinegar!\xe2\x80\x9d according to its Facebook site this morning. \xe2\x80\x9cStarting today you can purchase it exclusively on our Facebook page before it hits stores next month!\xe2\x80\x9dShortly afterward it directed a Facebook fan, who had complained about trouble purchasing, to a Facebook link to buy the special ketchup. After several similar complaint posts, the company put up the standard response and has been repeating it since. The firm\xe2\x80\x99s public relations person did not return a call or e-mail for comment.They better hurry. One user recently posted, \xe2\x80\x9cFix that tab! I got fries waiting!\xe2\x80\x9dUpdate: After this story was posted, the company sent the following response: ""Heinz regrets that our Facebook launch of Heinz Ketchup blended with Balsamic Vinegar was disrupted today by unforeseen technical difficulties that we are currently addressing,"" said Jessica\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jackson, group leader of public relations and communications at Heinz.

Most importantly, how is this decline impacting our economy?

The \xe2\x80\x9cdisappearing act\xe2\x80\x9d of small business bankers: As bankers reeled from their mounting losses and toxic assets, there was a race to mitigate risk. In a classic case of ""throwing the baby out with the bath water"", banks all but shut off the money supply to startups and small businesses.

Littlefair has been pushing for legislation that would encourage use of natural gas, but so far, he has been unsuccessful. Even so, the 50-year-old executive said he's cautiously optimistic about the possibility of passage of a nat gas bill in the near term. There is some criticism over nat gas use, though. Some environmentalists question whether it's safe, Cramer said. He thinks the arguments against nat gas are unfounded, but acknowledges it does pose a risk for the stock. CLNE may be risky, but Cramer likes it nonetheless. Last week, Clean Energy Fuels reported a ""break out"" quarter. Littlefair discussed the company's earnings, as well as its future prospects.

And when your small, innovative shoe company is suddenly challenged by more dominate players in the industry, that idea takes on a whole new meaning.Ask sisters Sarah and Jenifer Caplan. They became part-time business partners in 2009 when they created a niche product that they themselves wanted: inexpensive, durable, flat shoes that could be rolled up and stashed in their purses, providing quick relief when they had enough of their spike heels. Unlike indoor slippers, the Caplans\xe2\x80\x99 flats would be tough and stylish enough to wear on city streets or on a nightclub dance floor. Customers would be fashionable, fun-loving, budget-conscious women like themselves. They designed whimsical packaging and gave the product a name that connotes comfort and fun: Footzyrolls. It was recessionary fashion candy. \xe2\x80\x9cAt trade shows we introduced our shoes to boutiques as a fashion accessory that would sell for about $25. Our wholesale price was $10,\xe2\x80\x9d says Sarah, 28, who continued to hold down her day job as an executive at J.P. Morgan Chase in New York until last year. At an October 2009 trade show Sarah tracked down an editor of Oprah Winfrey\xe2\x80\x99s O magazine and got the shoes mentioned in the publication\xe2\x80\x99s holiday gift guide. Orders rolled in.So it should be no surprise that reps for Dr. Scholl\xe2\x80\x99s  saw the sisters\xe2\x80\x99 product and sore feet pitch. Several months later the big brand prototyped a similar product with similar packaging and a lower price.

471,NBA Players Make $3.3 Billion Bet That Might Pay Off,Sports Biz with Darren Rovell,15-11-2011,"When the NBA players announced their intention to disband their union with the plans to file an antitrust lawsuit against the league, they were putting $3.3 billion of their own money on the line.Here's the math.If they took the deal and earned 50 percent of Basketball Related Income, they'd make approximately $2.1 billion collectively for the season. NBA players would lose about $800 million to $1 billion over the course of a 10-year deal by conceding to go from where they wanted to be (52 percent) to where the league wanted them to be (50 percent).So by taking nothing, they lose that $2.1 billion, but also could lose the ability to get a better deal. If NBA commissioner David Stern holds on his offer that the next best deal he'll offer is 47 percent of Basketball Related Income, that's another $1.2 billion lost over a 10-year deal. Then, you have to factor in the fact that a lost season would likely lead to a decrease in revenue due to a decline in fan interest. I conservatively figured that revenue will be down 1.5 percent in Year 1 and 1 percent in Year 2 before getting back to the business it was last year in the third year. That's another $107.5 million split between the players and owners.That's how I get $3.3 billion.Now, let's discuss what they can win.

473,A Son's Call to Champion Entrepreneurial Efforts,Global Entrepreneurship 2011,15-11-2011,"My father, Leib Koyfman, finally escaped the Soviet Union in 1974. He came to the United States without speaking a word of English and with nary a penny in his pocket. What he had, though, was intelligence, education and determination. And so the entrepreneurial path began.He started to learn the English language and began his career in NYC as a draftsman at a local engineering firm. He slowly worked his way up as he gained more command of English and a feel for how to succeed in his new environment. By 1980, he was ready to pursue the American dream, the dream that brought him to this country. So he and his partner Robert went out on their own, put out a shingle and launched Robert Derector Associates Consulting Engineers. More than 30 years later, my father\xe2\x80\x99s entrepreneurial quest is one of the most defining of my own life. As a venture capitalist, I have chosen to spend my career helping entrepreneurs achieve their dreams. Having taken pride in my father\xe2\x80\x99s courage and accomplishments as an entrepreneur, I cannot help but think that, done correctly, this is a noble task. Our great country was founded on the backs of great entrepreneurs. And it will only continue to flourish if we champion entrepreneurship moving forward. As we turn from a manufacturing economy to an information economy, with a brief, untimely detour as a financial services economy, we must provide an environment across both the public and private sectors that champions and supports entrepreneurship. It is only innovation that can propel us to greatness in this 21st century. We are still in the second inning of advancing internet and mobile technologies and services. Energy, education, financial services and health care are massive industries that need to be re-imagined. Entrepreneurs will re-imagine and reinvent these industries. Entrepreneurs will push the bounds of technology innovation. Entrepreneurs are who need to be encouraged, enabled and celebrated, for the good of our country\xe2\x80\x99s future.

488,3 Lessons from a Small Business Owner,Small Business,15-11-2011,"Guest columnist Betty Shotton shares her tips to keep your enthusiasm high, your company on track, and mediocre performance a thing of the past. For entrepreneurs, there is nothing quite as exhilarating as the early stages of a start-up. Who needs caffeine when you have the rush of new ideas, a product made real, and paying customers? But what happens when the honeymoon is over and your nascent enthusiasm comes face to face with the harsh realities of today\xe2\x80\x99s business and economic climate? Running your own business is not for the faint of heart. Here are three practical tips to keep your enthusiasm high, your company on track, and mediocre performance a thing of the past: Lesson No. 1: \xc2\xa0Remember why you did it in the first place. Stay in touch with the passion and excitement that inspired you to start or buy a business. It is easy to get weighed down by financial pressures while attending to endless details and decisions. Once vibrant and energetic business owners often become stressed, worried and worn out. If that describes you, stop, and take a step back. Allow yourself the breathing room to remember, re-connect, and renew your commitment to the business. ",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/15/3-lessons-from-a-small-business-owner.html

501,Reaping Big Cost Savings With Reverse Auctions,Quick Changes for Business 2011,15-11-2011,"When home fashions retailer Anna\xe2\x80\x99s Linens began using reverse auctions in 2008, the goal was to save $50,000 a year on purchasing blankets. The company ended up saving a whopping $250,000 instead. Dozens of auctions later, the Costa Mesa, Calif.-based company has saved over $6 million by getting multiple bids on everything from printing to armored car service \xe2\x80\x94along with textiles. Getting access to more vendors and pinpointing real prices are the pay-offs, says Alan Gladstone, CEO and founder of Anna\xe2\x80\x99s Linens, which has nearly 300 stores in the U.S. Bids come in as far away as Pakistan, India and China. Hefty price savings is the main driver behind reverse auctions. Projects are auctioned off to a pool of suppliers \xe2\x80\x94 six to ten in the case of Anna\xe2\x80\x99s Linens \xe2\x80\x94 who compete for a company's business within a small window of time. Bids get increasingly lower as the bidding progresses. Week-long negotiations and discussions are distilled into minutes. Call it the Wal-Martization of the supply chain process. Hungry for cost savings, more companies are turning to reverse auctions. Gartner senior procurement analyst Deborah Wilson figures that up to 50,000 reverse auctions were held in the year ending October 31. That\xe2\x80\x99s a 10 percent increase over the year before. Companies are typically saving 10 to 20 percent by using reverse auctions for their purchasing, she says. Retailers and grocery industries, where there\xe2\x80\x99s more price pressure, are already heavy reverse auction users.\xe2\x80\x9cThey can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to be relationship oriented,\xe2\x80\x9d Wilson says. The auctions are transparent, held on an online platform where bidders can see others bids \xe2\x80\x94driving prices lower.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good way to get a handle on pricing ranges,\xe2\x80\x9d says Craig Agranoff, a Boca Raton, Florida-based business consultant. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can go back to suppliers and say: \xe2\x80\x98Why aren\xe2\x80\x99t you charging this.\xe2\x80\x99 It levels the playing field.\xe2\x80\x9d ",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/15/reaping-big-cost-savings-with-reverse-auctions.html

513,Government Mortgage Insurer Continues to Lose Cash Reserves ,Real Estate,15-11-2011,"The government's mortgage insurer is coming dangerously close to holding no excess cash reserves for loan losses. An annual independent actuarial report puts the FHA's loan loss reserves at .24% of its $1.1 trillion dollars in insured mortgages. The FHA, which does not originate loans, but insures them, has gone from less than 5 percent market share at the height of the housing boom to now more than 30 percent. The auditor measures the FHA's reserve by estimating future losses, and those estimates continue to grow as home prices fall and mortgage delinquencies still run very high. The FHA's estimated reserves stand at $2.6 billion as of September 30th, according to the report, down 45 percent from $4.7 billion last year. Congress mandates that the FHA's reserves must be at least 2 percent of its total insurance in force, but it hasn't been at that level for a few years now. Auditors estimate it will not be back above that level until 2014, and that would be based on the current book of business.

518,Johnson: Is Your 401(k) Plan a Trap?,The Guest Blog,15-11-2011,"In a matter of just 25 years, defined contribution plans have become the predominant retirement tool available to American workers, many of whom have little investment experience. Nevertheless, the novelty could be wearing off, as 401(k) plans may be ill-suited for the current economic environment. What a mess we\xe2\x80\x99ve found ourselves in? By all accounts, Europe is an open wound that continues to fester and there simply isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough money to solve the problem. The United States, exonerated by the Federal Reserve, isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly a model of good health, doing its best to reinforce an exquisite house of cards swaying effortlessly in the wind. Throughout it all, Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s marketing machine led retail investors to believe that asset allocation was the universal cure for market volatility. Average American investors, told that a portfolio diversified amongst traditional asset classes would mitigate risk, have been convinced that style-box bingo would preserve their life\xe2\x80\x99s savings through thick and thin. Nevertheless, large cap, mid cap, small cap and international equities are hyper correlated, offering little reprieve from market declines. Moreover, bonds have benefited from unseasonably low interest rates spawned by loose monetary policy. Should the sovereign debt issue escalate, it stands to reason that the above referenced asset classes would suffer in unison, as has been the case with Italian debt and international stocks. So where does that leave 401(k) participants? A casual observer of most defined contribution plans would undoubtedly notice the absence of alternative asset classes in the fund line-up, forcing investors to buy long only positions, often times lacking access to hard assets such as gold or commodities. As luck might have it, section 404(c) of ERISA, a voluntary set of guidelines adopted by most plans, requires fiduciaries to minimize the risk of large investment losses by offering a diversified menu of investment options. Of course, money market and stable value funds are coined as cash-equivalents, although they are protected by a prospectus, not the FDIC. The minute investors think they don\xe2\x80\x99t have access to their money, they\xe2\x80\x99ll demand its return whether they need it or not and begin a run on the bank, which is what happened in 2008 when 36 of the 100 largest U.S. prime money markets had to be propped up in order to survive the financial crisis. Fortunately, some 401(k) providers give participants the option to transfer a portion of their balance to an account that allows them to invest in the entire universe of options. Others permit an in-service withdrawal that grants the transfer of assets to a self-directed IRA without taxable consequences before separating from service. It should also be mentioned that as alternative assets become better understood, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be incorporated into more plans. Retail investors are beginning to understand the consequences of unsustainable public obligations. In a perfect world, stock prices would be a reflection of earnings and dividends, although today we must account for the risks posed by potential government bond defaults, the subsequent impact of derivatives and central banks determined to print their way out of a problem they facilitated. Employer-sponsored 401(k) retirement plans will have to disclose fees that savers pay on investments and transactions by 2012, but the opportunity cost of a weak menu of investment options could be staggering. 401(k) plans are an excellent means to accumulate wealth; they might also be the best way to lose a piece of your nest egg if the sovereign debt crisis remains unresolved.

519,Euro Daily Close Below 1.3480 Should Open Fresh Downside,Currency Contest,15-11-2011,"Currencies are expected to remain under pressure this week, with all markets seen trading lower against the buck. The primary driver of the price action will continue to be risk liquidation, with fears of contagion from the Eurozone periphery not only threatening a spread to the Eurozone core, but also showing signs of a more dramatic spread outside of the Eurozone. China is one country that we feel is still at risk of an accelerated slowdown, and this in our opinion will be the center of the third phase of the global economic recession, which began in the Unites States, spread to the Eurozone and will soon touch down in China. The latest IMF warnings that China\xe2\x80\x99s financial system is facing a steady build up in vulnerabilities, only help to reaffirm our bearish outlook on the economy. For now, however, the key focus is still in the Eurozone, and the negative attention has now shifted to Spain, with the country\xe2\x80\x99s bond spreads hitting record levels and elections on the horizon. The US Dollar should therefore continue to benefit from safe-haven flows, and could also find some additional relative strength on hawkish comments from Fed Fisher who sees the US economy growing in 2012.Technically, price action over the past few weeks has been quite telling, with any rallies in the Euro (and currencies in general), being easily absorbed and aggressively offset in an accelerated time-frame. A closer look at the sell-offs in the Euro on October 31st, November 9th, and November 14th are a testament to this fact. The implication is that markets are more inclined to see the Euro lower and are very quick to look to sell on any form of a rally. This strengthens our core USD bullish outlook and solidifies our strategy of continuing to look to sell currencies on any form of a rally against the buck. While we expect to see a deeper depreciation in the higher yielding currencies as the Euro weakens, we also continue to expect to see the Euro leading the way and setting the tone for the overall direction in the markets. As such, 1.3480 is the key level to watch in EUR/USD, and a break below will likely open the door for a more rapid broad based appreciation in the Greenback back towards its key highs (EUR/USD lows) from early October.On the data front, it was a very busy European session on Tuesday, but on the whole, the key standouts were some softer inflation data out of the UK and mixed German ZEW readings which continued to show deterioration. Sterling was one of the better performers on a relative basis, with the currency finding some bids on the back of broader risk liquidation exposing more vulnerable currencies like the Euro and commodity bloc. US equity futures and gold are lower on the day by a good amount, while oil trades flat. ",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/15/euro-daily-close-below-13480-should-open-fresh-downside.html

In a nation that has always encouraged people to spend, in an economy that is primarily based on consumers, people becoming more conservative with their money may be bad news.

Lawmakers, under heavy pressure from housing lobbies, want to reinstate higher loan limits at the FHA, although not at mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are currently under government conservatorship. The loan limits fell from a maximum $729,750 to $625,000 on October first. This affected 600 US counties for FHA, but less than half of that for Fannie and Freddie. FHA is not a mortgage originator but an insurer. It is currently the only low down payment game in town, with a minimum 3.5 percent home buyer investment. It is therefore supposed to be a small share of the mortgage market, but given today's tight underwriting, it's about a third of the market. Now the FHA's share could get even larger because it would have a hold on a small segment of the market from which Fannie and Freddie would be excluded. So how would that affect FHA's bottom line?

There is some optimism surrounding the Nat Gas Act, though. As introduced in the Senate on Tuesday, the legislation provides tax incentives to buy natural gas engines, though past efforts of this kind have been slowed and halted by political wrangling.To the head of Chesapeake Energy , one of the biggest U.S. natural gas  drillers, things are different this time around.""The problem with the bill up until now has been how are we going to pay for it? And are we going to spend money we don\xe2\x80\x99t have?"" said Chesapeake CEO Aubrey McClendon during an interview on ""Mad Money w/Jim Cramer"" on Wednesday. ""Well now we\xe2\x80\x99re going to tax ourselves and so if you use natural gas as a fuel, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to pay up to 15 cents or so over the next 10 years to pay for 5 years worth of credit to get the vehicles updated.\xe2\x80\x9dMcClendon isn't counting on the bill's passage, but wants congressmen should consider its advantages. The Nat Gas Act provides policymakers the opportunity work on a bi-partisan basis to lower Americans\xe2\x80\x99 transportation bills, create jobs and improve air quality, as fewer vehicles will burn gasoline and diesel, he argued.While Westport Innovations  CEO David Demers supports the legislation, he's not holding his breath. \xe2\x80\x9cOur business can\xe2\x80\x99t depend on waiting for Washington.

These kinds of businesses don't need incentives like the Nat Gas Act, Demers explained, because the low cost of nat gas is all the incentive they need.

The former is currently selling for 8.6 times next year's earnings while Celgene sells for 14.5 times earnings. Pfizer may appear cheaper, but Cramer said it only has a lower multiple. While Pfizer yields 4 percent and has a big buyback, Cramer said it lacks growth and that means you can't justify paying up for this stock.

570,80 Is the New 65 for Many Retirees,Consumer Nation,16-11-2011,"The concept of a \xe2\x80\x9cretirement age\xe2\x80\x9d is becoming irrelevant, at least according to a new studyof middle-class Americans.Whether it's a desire to reach a certain nest-egg number, dealing with rising health-care costs, or grappling with mortgage debt, more workers are deciding to delay retirement.A quarter of middle-class Americans \xe2\x80\x94 defined as earning between $25,000 and $99,000 annually \xe2\x80\x94 say they will \xe2\x80\x9cneed to work until at least age 80,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the annual retirement study by Wells Fargo.""Another interesting shift in the mindset of Americans is their perception of how much money they need. Three-fourths of respondents said it's more important to have a specific amount versus a date: $350,000 was the median nest-egg goal, but median retirement savings were only $25,000 dollars,"" said Laurie Nordquist, executive vice president of institutional retirement at Wells Fargo.Money managers will tell you that the driving force behind delayed retirement is the savings gap. The gap is widened by grim economic factors hitting the middle class. ""Social Security cuts and mortgage debts are on the top of their minds,"" adds Nordquist. Mortgage Debt When it comes to mortgages, the generational gap is the great divider. Overall, 86 percent of respondents said they want to pay off their mortgage before retirement.Get underneath the ages, however, and the tunes change. Ninety-one percent of people age 25 to 29 cited this goal as very important. Over age 60? Just 40 percent said they thought it was important.This data reveal a growing trend in expectations. Much of them have to do with how young and old view Social Security . Social SecurityMore than a quarter of people in their 20s and 30s expect no income at all from Social Security during retirement years. On average, people in that age group expect Social Security to cover only 20 percent of their retirement funding, according to the study. While political leaders consider potential cuts to future Social Security and Medicarebenefits, those already in their 60s still consider their pensions a sure bet.Given these factors, what is a hopeful retiree to do? ""We're seeing people work longer, but they can also change their lifestyle expectations,"" Nordquist says. Workers are already adjusting to this new reality. ""I'm talking with the tax man now to see what the options are. I wasn't planning on delaying retirement, no. But I'm considering part-time work,"" says Linda Wilson, 63, who works full time for the Bonnier Corp. She's been working full time for more than 20 years. Inheritance? A Thing of the PastThe study also found that older Americans are hanging on to their money.

576,1 of the Most Crucial Elements of Investing,Mad Money,15-11-2011,"One of the most crucial elements of investing, Cramer said Tuesday, is determining which stocks are cheap and which are expensive.Take AT&T and CenturyLink , for example, a $29 and $37 stock respectively. The share price is meaningless, though, because when you buy a stock, you are paying for the company\xe2\x80\x99s future earnings stream. So Cramer recommends looking at the earnings-per-share estimates for next year and the price-to-earnings multiple, which indicates how much investors are willing to pay for those earnings. AT&T sells for 12 times earnings while CenturyLink sells for 14 times earnings. At first it appears CenturyLink is slightly more expensive. Then again, CTL pays a 7.8 percent dividend yield while T yields 5.9 percent. So with a higher yield, it makes sense investors should pay up for CTL.Based on earnings and dividends, both T and CTL have comparable valuations and neither seems more or less expensive \xe2\x80\x94 at first. But to Cramer, AT&T is less expensive by far. While both may have similar multiples, Cramer explained that the quality of the merchandise is very different. Just compare the multiple to the growth rate \xe2\x80\x94 when growth prospects are factored in for each stock, CenturyLink is roughly 7 times as expensive as AT&T. \xe2\x80\x9cCenturyLink may look attractive at first glance given that it has a comparable multiple to AT&T with a higher yield, but when you look under the hood, there's no growth here,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said, adding he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think the extra yield is worth the extra fright. \xe2\x80\x9cSo why not go with AT&T instead with it's wireless growth, safe dividend, and the possibility of a game-changing T-Mobile acquisition?\xe2\x80\x9d",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/15/1-of-the-most-crucial-elements-of-investing.html

579,Is Oil Refining Finally Getting More Efficient?,Trader Talk,16-11-2011,"A number of refiners are weak today. In the long run, it may be good news for consumers. Crude oil transporter Enbridge announced it was going to buy Conoco's 50 percent stake in a pipeline that ran from Freeport, Texas, to Cushing, Okla., for $1.15 billion and reverse the flow of oil. About 150,000 barrels a day will go from Cushing to the Gulf Coast by the middle of next year, and 400,000 by the first quarter of 2013. Why is this important? Because refiners have been able to play a neat trick, profiting from the nearly $20 price difference between West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent crude. Gasoline prices do not trade off WTI, they trade off Brent crude. Some refiners can buy oil at $99 a barrel, but sell gasoline based off the Brent crude price. Those margins will now be under pressure. ",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/16/is-oil-refining-finally-getting-more-efficient.html

590,"!Hola, Bargains Await Down South",Money in Motion,16-11-2011,"The Mexican peso looks ready to rise, these strategists say.With all the tumult in Europe, many emerging-market currencies have been largely out of the spotlight - and under the rader, some positioning quirks have developed that spell investment opportunities, say Claudio Irigoyen and Ezekiel Aguirre, currency strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. To wit:""When markets began to fret about European sovereign solvency and risk aversion jumped, foreign investors who were invested in Mexican government bonds chose not to sell them, and hedged the foreign exchange exposure via futures instead,"" they wrote in a note to clients. In effect, these foreign investors - who held 41.1% of all Mexican government bonds, an all-time high, as of November 2 - were selling the peso  to hedge their bond positions, creating downward pressure on the currency. At the same time, non-commercial investors went from peso positions that were net long $4.2 billion in mid-July to positions that were net short $1 billion by November 11, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.There have been similar swings in these investors' positions in other Latin American currencies. But since late October, they have been reversing course in the Brazilian real  and others, while their net short position in the Mexican peso has increased slightly. That means a recovery in Europe could spur more reversals in net short peso positions than others - and a worsening crisis there would mean holders of other currencies would have more to hedge.Irigoyen and Aguirre were seeing value in the peso before the positioning data became clear, thanks to a lagging economic recovery and cheap valuation in fundamental terms. But now, they say, ""We think this divergence in positioning between the real and the peso presents an additional motive to go long MXN against the BRL."" Your move.

591,Thai Army Turns Flooding Into a PR Opportunity,Asia-Pacific News,15-11-2011,"Troops and army trucks are rolling through the streets of Bangkok again. But this time it is not to battle protesters or overthrow a prime minister.Instead, they are ferrying residents around the city on heavy-duty military vehicles that can get through its flooded streets, with banners on each one reading \xe2\x80\x9cRoyal Thai Army helping the people.\xe2\x80\x9dIn a country deeply divided over the military\xe2\x80\x99s role in civilian life, Thailand\xe2\x80\x99s top generals have used the floods, the worst the country has had in decades, as an opportunity to showcase the army\xe2\x80\x99s friendlier side.Thousands of soldiers have been sent to the capital to help civilians. At the same time, the military has broadcast a series of slick television advertisements showing its soldiers as more than just battle-hardened fighters, including one in which children learn about soldiers who build roads and tend to the sick. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are the people\xe2\x80\x99s army,\xe2\x80\x9d says a voice at the end of the ads.The head of the Thai Army, Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha \xe2\x80\x94 who led the troops that broke up antigovernment demonstrators in Bangkok last year in a violent episode that left at least 90 people dead \xe2\x80\x94 has repeatedly said that he wants the military to be seen as a benevolent, apolitical force in Thai society.\xe2\x80\x9cI want people to love soldiers,\xe2\x80\x9d General Prayuth was quoted as saying in the Thai news media last month.In October, General Prayuth reshuffled his public relations team, promoting a telegenic soldier, Lt. Col. Wanchana Sawasdee, to deputy spokesman. Mild-mannered and dashing, Colonel Wanchana is also the lead actor in a series of films, financed partly by the government, that tell the stories of ancient Thai triumphs over Burmese enemies.In an interview, Colonel Wanchana said he sometimes sensed hostility when he went on missions to help flood victims and offer food and supplies.\xe2\x80\x9cWe know some of these people dislike the military,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are trying to dissolve the hatred.\xe2\x80\x9dAll told, about 50,000 troops, 1,000 trucks and 1,000 military boats are being used for flood relief in Bangkok and the surrounding area, the military said.By some measures, the Thai Army\xe2\x80\x99s image does seem to be improving. A Facebook page titled \xe2\x80\x9cWe Love Thai Military\xe2\x80\x9d has more than 17,000 followers.\xe2\x80\x9cNow I love the military even more than before,\xe2\x80\x9d said one visitor to the page, Somwang Platong. \xe2\x80\x9cThe military are the real heroes of Bangkok and the entire people.\xe2\x80\x9dSome Thais, though, are not convinced that the army\xe2\x80\x99s efforts are proof of a philanthropic nature. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to distinguish between duty and charity,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote one commentator on a Web news group, Pantip.com.The Thai military has played a central role in political life from the beginning of Thailand\xe2\x80\x99s modern era in 1932, when a group of officers staged a coup and abolished the absolute rule of the monarchy. The army\xe2\x80\x99s popularity has waxed and waned since then, through decades of military takeovers, bloody crackdowns on protesters, and retreats to the barracks again.\xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot be a conventional military like the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d Boonsrang Niumpradit, a retired general, said in an interview this year. Thailand\xe2\x80\x99s democracy is weak and occasionally needs propping up, he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to take care of weak spots.\xe2\x80\x9dBut the military\xe2\x80\x99s frequent interventions in politics have also been at the heart of the country\xe2\x80\x99s political turmoil in recent years. The overthrow of the government led by Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in 2006 was the prelude for the protests last year. Those tensions have been largely pushed below the surface with the electoral victory in July of Mr. Thaksin\xe2\x80\x99s sister Yingluck Shinawatra, who is now prime minister.But the power struggle between the civilian authorities and the military continues. The current military leadership says it wants to extricate the army from politics, though it sometimes bristles at the idea of civilian primacy.\xe2\x80\x9cSoldiers don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be the lead actor,\xe2\x80\x9d General Prayuth said last month, but \xe2\x80\x9cwe want a supporting role.\xe2\x80\x9dPoypiti Amatatham contributed reporting.",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/15/thai-army-turns-flooding-into-a-pr-opportunity.html
592,Housing Crash Causing Record Stagnation ,Realty Check,16-11-2011,"Just over 11 million Americans moved between March of 2010 and March of 2011, according to a new report from the U.S. Census. That might sound like a lot, but it's actually a record low, down from 12 and a half million who moved the previous year. The record high was 46 million movers in 1984-85, and you have to factor in that the population has grown immensely since then. The housing crash has left Americans stagnant, but even worse, it has left homeowners trapped. The decline in the mobility rate of those who already own homes was even more dramatic. Just 4.7 percent of homeowners moved in the past year, down from 5.2 percent the previous year, according to the Census. That translates into 9.7 million homeowners, again a record low.

Initially, risk correlated assets were sold on widening bond yields and a slew of downbeat comments out of the Eurozone, before finding some intraday bids on rumors that China would step up to the plate and provide more relief. However, the risk rally proved fleeting and risk liquidation picked back up on reports that the Unicredit CEO was meeting with the ECB to discuss additional funding fro Italian banks.\xc2\xa0 All major currencies remain under pressure against the safe-haven US Dollar, which at the same time has been finding some additional bids on its own merits following a solid retail sales print in the US on Tuesday.

The Australian Dollar is now on the verge of a break back below parity against the buck and has found some additional offers on some softer overnight data. Elsewhere, the Bank of Japan left rates on hold at 0-0.10% as widely expected but also lowered its economic assessment. In Europe, Eurozone inflation readings were as expected, UK employment data was mixed, while the Bank of England inflation report confirmed the anticipated dovish tone of the central bank. Looking ahead, US CPI, TICs data, industrial production, capacity utilization, NAHB housing, and oil and gas inventory data are the key economic releases in North America.

599,A Super Tax Hike Spells Disaster ,Money & Politics with Larry Kudlow,16-11-2011,"It would be a great tragedy if a super tax hike came out of asupercommittee compromise deal. It would do great harm to the economy\xe2\x80\x94just as much harm as President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s various tax-hike threats. And on the Republican side, a super tax hike would irreparably split the GOP. Okay. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the good news. In a CNBC interview this week,I asked supercommittee co-chair Jeb Hensarling about an idea of the Democrats to raise taxes by $600 billion to $800 billion. About $300 billion of that might be up-front, with $500 billion later from some tax-reform overhaul. This would be an unmitigated economic disaster. But Hensarling was blunt: \xe2\x80\x9cNot going to happen, Larry.\xe2\x80\x9d He said no such deal has been presented to him. And if it were, he and other Republicans on the supercommittee would not support it. Hensarling then added, \xe2\x80\x9cWe put $250 billion of what is known as static revenue on the table, but only if we can bring down rates. We believe we can bring the top individual rate down to 28, 29, maybe at most 30 percent, and bring the corporate rate down to the median of the EU, 25 percent.\xe2\x80\x9d For emphasis, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have gone as far as we feel we can go.\xe2\x80\x9d The Texan was referring to the Sen. Pat Toomey plan, which would lower the personal tax rate to 28 percent and head down from there, while at the same time putting limits on personal deductions (such as mortgage interest) for upper-income taxpayers. In other words, flatten the rates and broaden the base. Net revenues would go up in this scheme for two reasons: first, the reduction in personal tax breaks; second, the economic-growth impact would be positive. This calls on the research of Harvard professor Martin Feldstein, who urged Congress to trade off lower rates with fewer deductions since the incentive effect of taking home more after-tax income would benefit the economy. Trouble is, Democrats don\xe2\x80\x99t buy into it\xe2\x80\x94at least not yet. Senate supercommittee members Patty Murray and John Kerry have opposed real tax reform. And it has been reported that House supercommittee member Xavier Becerra opposes it (although Chris van Hollen might be looking at it). But the whole trouble with the machinations of the two sides in this deficit-cutting episode is that the closer you get to the November 23 deadline, the more compromises are made. Democrats are pulling hard for higher tax rates, which would damage the economy, while Republicans are making no progress getting any meaningful health-care entitlement reform. And the GOP is in danger of losing the narrative. Most of the noise is coming from Democratic proposals for higher taxes, while Republicans have not taken any entitlement-spending-cut scalps. In all likelihood, Hensarling will succeed in his conference with the idea of making the Bush tax rates permanent in return for about $300 billion of loophole-closers. The deeper-tax-rate-cut Toomey reform doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be gaining traction. Trouble is, so called tax reform would probably be handed over to the tax-writing committees in the Senate and House for a decision next year. At deal-time this year -- if there is a deal -- we won\xe2\x80\x99t know what the tax-rate picture will actually look like. At least that\xe2\x80\x99s a risk. But it\xe2\x80\x99s possible in a worst-case scenario that personal-deduction limits will be hammered out up front, without any assurances of lower tax rates next year. All this leads me back to this question: Where are the super spending cuts? Nowhere. So why not fall back on the across-the-board budget-cutting trigger known as sequestration? That\xe2\x80\x99s the $1.2 trillion backup plan if a $1.5 trillion deal cannot be reached. (Hensarling called the $1.2 trillion backstop very important.) Then at least some spending will be cut. And the trigger is probably better than a deal that uses Iraq and Afghanistan spending cuts that would happen anyway or fiddles around with the current-services baseline from which reductions are measured. For defense hawks who object -- since 50 percent of the trigger would come out of national security -- any spending measures would have a shelf life of only one year: 2013. After that, new presidents and Congresses will do what they will. In another interview, congressman Ron Paul (now in a dead heat for first place in Iowa polling) told me the GOP should forget tax hikes and trigger $1.2 trillion in spending cuts. Out on the campaign trail, Newt Gingrich agrees. But for investors and people in business, a super tax hike would be the worst possible outcome. So take the spending-cut sequestration now, and then fight the real battle in November 2012. That\xe2\x80\x99s better than a supercommittee deal at any cost. Questions?

634,Ex-Olympus Boss to Meet Japanese Police,Companies,17-11-2011,"Michael Woodford, the former Olympus chief executive whose revelations about suspicious acquisitions by the camera maker precipitated a scandal over improper accounting, will return to Japan next week to speak with authorities investigating the case, the Financial Times has learned.Mr. Woodford confirmed to the FT that he would meet next Thursday with Japanese police, prosecutors and officials from the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, Japan\xe2\x80\x99s financial markets regulator, in his first trip to Tokyo since Olympus fired him on Oct 14.The Briton returned to the UK immediately after he was sacked amid a clash with other executives over the deals. Olympus has since admitted using phoney fees and inflated valuations in four acquisitions to dispose of long-hidden losses on securities investments.His return could galvanize the response of Japanese law enforcement agencies and regulators to the scandal. More than $1 billion was diverted in the four deals, but Olympus has yet to identify who received the money or explain how it disguised the losses, which it says dated from the 1990s.The US Federal Bureau of Investigation and the UK Serious Fraud Office are also investigating international aspects of the case. In one of the acquisitions, Olympus\xe2\x80\x99 2008 purchase of the UK medical equipment maker Gyrus, the Japanese group paid $687m to an obscure US-based financial adviser and an affiliated fund in the Cayman Islands.Before he was fired, Mr. Woodford had questioned Olympus\xe2\x80\x99 chairman and two other executives about the deals, which took place between 2006 and 2008, before he joined the board. Mr. Woodford became Olympus\xe2\x80\x99 president in April, after working for 30 years at the company\xe2\x80\x99s European arm.Olympus has blamed the chairman, Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, and the other two executives for orchestrating the accounting deception. Mr. Kikukawa resigned as chairman in late October and the others lost their executive positions last week, but none has spoken publicly since the company admitted wrongdoing.In addition to the investigations by government authorities, a team of Olympus-appointed legal experts is also looking into the affair.The scandal has forced the company to delay announcing its results for the first half of the financial year, but it must report by December 14 or face delisting from the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

And Paul Robson, senior G20 FX strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland, sees a trading opportunity. In Sweden, exports account for about half of GDP and about 40% of those exports go to Europe - a tough situation when European economic data is becoming ever more gloomy. But Norway, a player in oil, has been benefiting from strength in oil services and investment. Then there are the central banks. In Sweden, ""175 basis points of tightening since the Riksbank began normalizing the policy rate in July 2010 has also weighed on the Swedish consumer and leaves significant scope for rate cuts,"" says Robson in a note to clients. But in Norway, rising housing prices are limiting the central bank's interest in potentially inflationary rate cuts. ""Overall, it appears there remains greater scope for rate cuts in Sweden than in Norway,"" Robson says. Add in the fact that the Norwegian krone has only a low correlation with changes in risk appetite, as measured by the ups and downs of the S&P 500, and you have a buying opportunity.Robson recommends buying the Norwegian krone against the Swedish krona at 1.1713, with a target of 1.2200 and a stop on a 2-day close below 1.1605.

645,To Erode our Economy: Turn Away Immigrant Entrepreneurs,Global Entrepreneurship 2011,17-11-2011,"The best-known aphorism in economics holds that there is no such thing as a free lunch. There is, however, one glaring exception: immigrant entrepreneurs. This group of people seeks to come to the United States to start companies, create jobs, and add wealth to the economy. Yet America, once a magnet for aspiring entrepreneurs from all over the world, is increasingly turning them away.At a time when the country is struggling with persistently high unemploymentand even skill shortages in some areas, one can think of few better ways to erode our own economic future. Recently, the Kauffman Foundation received an email from a European entrepreneur\xe2\x80\x94let\xe2\x80\x99s call him Jay\xe2\x80\x94who participated in our Global Scholars program this year. This program, completely funded by foreign governments, brings in potential entrepreneurs from other countries to study and experience American entrepreneurship, develop networks, intern with entrepreneurial companies and take their skills back to their home countries. Importantly, we find that a good number of these individuals seek to remain in the United States to either start their own companies or join other startups. Even when they decide to return home, the entrepreneurial networks that have arisen out of the program are a boon to American companies. But Jay, an engineer who landed a job with a U.S. startup during the program, is being denied re-entry to the country. In his case, the denial stems from a third party error related to the type of visa he acquired. Once the mistake was discovered and rectified, however, American immigration officials still refused to allow Jay back in. As he put it: \xe2\x80\x9cI am trying to bring in money from Europe to the States. Why not let me enter the country?!\xe2\x80\x9d This is not an isolated example. Last year, we received a call from a technology startup whose Finnish co-founder was stuck in Europe because the United States refused to grant him a visa. And in surveys of Indian and Chinese entrepreneurs, entrepreneur-turned-academic Vivek Wadhwa has found that an increasing number of them are leaving the United States to start their companies. In some cases this reflects more promising opportunities in their home markets, but in others it reflects silly immigration policies. True, the plural of anecdote is not data, but it is difficult to ignore the continuous amassing of such anecdotes and, in any case, some researchers have found more systematic evidence. Immigration attorney Malcolm Goeschl has investigated the adjudication process for H-1B visas conducted by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). He found that, while the law on the books is generally conducive to allowing American entrepreneurs to hire immigrant co-founders and employees, implementation of that law is far less friendly. In recent years, Goeschl observed, USCIS \xe2\x80\x9chas made it increasingly difficult for startups and small companies to hire highly qualified foreign nationals through H-1B sponsorship.\xe2\x80\x9d The Administrative Appeals Office usually does not reverse these decisions, and immigration lawyers say denials for small companies have risen.

651,The Dollar and the Deficit Supercommittee,Money in Motion,17-11-2011,"One week. That's all the time the deficit supercommittee has to reach a deal, and so far it's not looking good. Both sides are talking tough, and a Citi Macro Trading survey of investors found that fewer than 20% think the committee can reach a deal that would avert mandatory cuts. That said, Greg Anderson, senior FX strategist with Citigroup, thinks that view is overly pessimistic. He points out that the current Congress is extremely unpopular, and says looming elections could spur supercommittee members to compromise. If that were to happen, Anderson told me, ""I would expect the Australian dollar  to be the biggest beneficiary in G10 space. In emerging markets, it would be the Mexican dollar.  Moves of 2-3% in these currencies wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t shock me if we got a surprise grand bargain,"" since trading is likely to be thin right before the Thanksgiving holiday. In the meantime, though, ""There is considerable two-way risk associated with the supercommittee events over the next week,"" he says.The other question is what a failure to reach a deal would do to the dollar. Anderson argues that in the event of failure, ""the dollar  will rally 1-2% across the board"" thanks to demand for safe havens, with the biggest moves likely against the euro  and the Canadian dollar. But Stewart Hall, senior fixed income and currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets, told me that in the absence of a deal, he thinks ""we face revisiting the painful displays of partisan politics that weighed on the dollar in July and August, keeping the DXY pinned near to the lows over that period.""Really, either view has logic behind it. Too bad the supercommittee members can't see their debate that way. Tune In: CNBC's ""Money in Motion Currency Trading"" airs on Fridays at 5:30pm and repeats on Saturdays at 7pm.

662,Small Businesses Learn From October Storm,Small Business,17-11-2011,"In late October, a rare snowstorm hit the Northeast, piling heavy, wet snow on leaf-filled trees. Within hours on that Saturday afternoon, power lines went down and homes and businesses went dark, with some areas seeing an accumulation of 20 inches by nightfall.Nearly 3 million homes and businesses along the East coast \xe2\x80\x94 in Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts \xe2\x80\x94 were affected. In New Jersey, more than 600,000 outages were reported. In Connecticut, the hardest-hit state, 850,000 homes and businesses were without power, and some stayed that way for more than a week.In his 20 years as owner of Northeast Express Transportation, Kevin Maloney had never experienced such devastation.

Instead of investing in highways, ports, high-speed rail projects, and modern utilities, the U.S. has for decades continued putting new coats of paint on the same cracked wall. As a result, Americans continue to sit in hours of traffic each day and trade is hampered by congested ports and entryways.Coastal areas continue to be one Category 3 hurricane away from mass devastation. Major cities still rely on water pipes and sewers more than a century old that regularly leak and burst, and would certainly not fare well in a major earthquake. Aside from some forward-thinking Asian countries, the situation is even worse globally, particularly in regions with mass poverty and unstable political and economic climates.Modern infrastructure is not just a public good, but an economic one too. Communities with modern, effective infrastructure draw new investment, and the actual construction of new projects creates jobs. Today\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders have good reason to promote domestic infrastructure investment, as academic research unequivocally shows a link between the state of local infrastructure and economic development.The ProblemUnfortunately, when it comes to infrastructure projects, there is no central marketplace for sharing of opportunities.

674,"Ready for Launch: Five, Four, Three, Two, One...",Global Entrepreneurship 2011,17-11-2011,"In today\xe2\x80\x99s grim economic environment, we are all looking for positive indicators. So let me share a few. First, in my 25 years as a venture capitalist, there has never been a better time to conceive of and then test an innovative and potentially disruptive idea. Entrepreneurs, especially in the United States and western Europe, have access to interconnected and sophisticated research tools, no-walls platforms for sharing and integrating ideas, and a talented pool of human capital and mentors. This means that a business concept can be quickly tested and killed, saving a lot of capital, or tested, refined, and launched\xe2\x80\x94building a lot of capital and jobs. This should be the golden age of innovation and entrepreneurialism. What can we do to achieve this status? Let me get to that in a moment. I just returned from the second annual Global Venture Capital Congress, and with the exception of two countries that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t attend, all regions of the world were represented. Also present were all of the major stock exchanges and representatives from large institutional buyers. The exchanges and financial houses shared strong views regarding how we can achieve momentum in the capital markets, unlocking a significant barrier to the cycle of company growth and profitability. First, the exchanges acknowledged that a number of macro factors\xe2\x80\x94economic uncertainty around the world, the Japanese tsunami, the Arab spring\xe2\x80\x94have made the capital markets quite volatile and have compromised the ability for emerging growth companies to find liquidity through a public offering. But they also stressed that a great deal of capital is sitting on the sidelines, giving hope to IPO seeking businesses. Large institutional buyers agreed, but stressed the need for greater transparency, reality pricing, and for companies to be able to clearly articulate their path to profitability. Seems reasonable. So what can we do to better pave the pathway for these emerging growth companies? Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at the efforts of the U.S. IPO Task Force. This initiative was borne out of the U.S. Treasury Department, which pulled together a group of private sector professionals who agreed to come together to examine the challenges with the U.S. IPO market and make recommendations to help re-energize the capital markets system \xe2\x80\x94 especially for small, emerging growth companies. The IPO Task Force looked primarily at regulatory fixes and came up with a plan that had four major components: Provide regulatory on-ramp for emerging growth companies Improve availability of information to investors Educate issuers on how better to work with investment banks Offer a one-time IPO Tax incentive to buy and hold shares Capitol Hill is digesting these ideas, but there seems to be a strong interest in the recommendations. It will be good to watch this effort and continue to support its ideals. More than 90 percent of job creation at venture-backed companies occurs after an IPO. If we can better shepherd our emerging growth companies through the capital markets, we might just see light at the end of a long challenging tunnel, representing the golden age of innovation and entrepreneurialism. That is a future that looks very bright indeed. Terry McGuire is co-founder and managing general partner of Polaris Venture Partners, a venture capital firm.

679,Learsy: Boone Pickens is Wrong. We Don\xe2\x80\x99t Have the Cheapest Oil and Gas ,The Guest Blog,17-11-2011,"Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s quoted price for Brent Crude  (the bench mark generally used worldwide) is $117.70/barrel, while WTI Crude  (the benchmark used in the U.S.) delivered at Cushing Oklahoma is $102/bbl. A difference of $15.50 per barrel. According to Pickens on Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s Morning Call on CNBC segmentthe price for natural gas in the Far East is $16/mmbtu, in Europe $13/mmbtu while the price of natural gas as quoted for natural gas in the U.S. is under $4/ mmbtu. In both cases the difference in price is significant, with markets in the U.S. having a distinct advantage. But it is the markets where the U.S. enjoys the advantage and not necessarily in the cost of oil/gas. Saudi Arabia can pump oil for less than $1.50 a barrel and Qatar the cost of natural gas can be assumed at levels of cost comparable to that in the U.S., perhaps less. It is the markets that are more efficient in the U.S. resulting in lower prices. By more efficient one might say less influenced, but not free, of market speculation if not manipulation. The problem was clearly set forth by Rex Tillerson, Chairman and CEO of Exxon Mobil , in his testimony before the Senate Finance Committee in May of this year stating that he found the price of oil higher by $30/$40 barrel because of speculation. It needs raise the question what role if any do Saudi Arabia/OPEC, Russia play in determining the price Brent Crude, not to speak of speculators determining the price of WTI. As to the market price of natural gas, the price of gas in the U.S. of $3.50 mmbtu is clearly the price determination most reflective of real supply and demand. First, American natural gas is a price determined exclusively as a domestic commodity. Here there are no opaque offshore commodity exchanges trading U.S. produced natural gas giving our oversight agencies such as the CFTC, Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department far more direct impact on the workings of the natural gas market.

683,"With MF Global Money Still Missing, Suspicions Grow",Hedge Funds,17-11-2011,"Nearly three weeks after $600 million in customer money went missing from MF Global, the search for the cash has been hampered by the bankrupt brokerage firm\xe2\x80\x99s sloppy record-keeping, an increasingly worrisome situation that has left regulators frustrated and customers in the lurch.The round-the-clock effort has consumed an alphabet soup of federal regulators and criminal investigators, with lawyers sleeping at open desks and each agency commandeering a different conference room at the firm\xe2\x80\x99s offices. But as authorities comb through some 38,000 customer accounts, they are growing more suspicious about what went wrong at MF Global, the commodities powerhouse once run by Jon S. Corzine, the former Democratic governor of New Jersey.\xe2\x80\x9cThe lost money is sort of like a lost child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery day that passes is more and more concerning, and there\xe2\x80\x99s less and less hope.\xe2\x80\x9dAt a bankruptcy hearing on Wednesday, a lawyer for the trustee overseeing the liquidation of the brokerage house would not speculate on the matter, acknowledging simply that the money was still missing.After MF Global filed for bankruptcy in late October, hundreds of examiners descended on the firm\xe2\x80\x99s New York and Chicago offices. Since then, they have been poring over records, verifying customer accounts and interrogating the skeleton staff that remains.The futures commission is heading the search in the futures business for the missing $600 million, armed with at least 15 accounting and enforcement staff members on site in New York. The Securities and Exchange Commission is focusing on a separate MF Global unit, as workers report back to bosses in Washington in twice-daily conference calls. Federal prosecutors in New York and Chicago have issued subpoenas, according to one person with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.As part of the effort, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has taken the lead in the interviews of former employees who can explain MF Global\xe2\x80\x99s inner workings. The federal authorities have also taken control of an off-site emergency recovery system, where e-mail and phone records from MF Global were stored, said two people who also spoke on condition of anonymity.Authorities are particularly focused on the final days of MF Global.

686,Blog: Higher Education Access and Debt: Can We Find Help from Australia? ,The Guest Blog,17-11-2011,"President Obama has come out with his proposal to expand income-based repayment and permit consolidation of FFELP and Direct Loans. In recent weeks both Kevin Careyand Diane Auer-Jones (a former Department of Education official in the Bush administration) posted commentaries in the Chroniclesuggesting we take a look at the British and Australian models of student lending. Both make valid arguments, which are supported from this perspective from the trenches\xe2\x80\xa6We face two major dilemmas with respect to paying for higher education: 1) high levels of student loan indebtedness are placing many college graduates (and non-completers) in very precarious financial circumstances, and 2) despite increasing levels of financial aid, including student loans, many students are still unable to afford the level of higher education to which they aspire. Student Debt. President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s plan is a legitimate step, but needs to go further. Under his plan, income-based repayment is not available to everybody, consolidation opportunities remain limited, private loan debt is not considered, interest rates are scheduled to increase dramatically, and students still have to resort to private loans because Direct Loans are not enough to cover costs. Since 1989, college students in Australia have had the opportunity to borrow funds for higher education while paying off their debt over many years. Through the HECS/FEE-HELP programs run by the Australian government, students may borrow an amount up to the annual cost of tuition, and there are aggregate loan limits. Students pay a one-time fee of up to 25% of the loan value instead of interest, and the principal balance is indexed to inflation. Levels of repayment range from 4-8% of total income. To ensure collection, loan repayments are withheld from employee paychecks through an arrangement with the Australian Tax Office. This ensures payment from those earning above set income thresholds, allowing for lower fees/interest rates, and essentially eliminating defaults. Student Access. We should understand that much of the underlying cause of student indebtedness is a lack of resources, either from the students and their families or from the financial aid system in the form of grant aid, to allow access to higher education for many students. The Australian program allows for higher borrowing limits. Should this also be considered? Even public higher education is often not financially accessible to students from disadvantaged backgrounds, and frequently not to middle-income families, without students taking on substantial debt. With federal and state grants, students of most economic backgrounds can usually afford tuition at community colleges, though many still need student loans. At present, however, many disadvantaged and middle-income students are not able to afford the cost of an on-campus education at many of our nation\xe2\x80\x99s public universities (Ohio is a good example), even after taking out maximum Federal Direct Loans. Is this what we want? ",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/17/blog-higher-education-access-and-debt-can-we-find-help-from-australia.html

688,Lots of Interest In Jefferies Puts,Options Action,17-11-2011,"Jefferies  shares touched a 52-week low today, and if put activity is any indication, options traders see them going even lower. As of noon today, over 10,000 of the November 10-strike puts traded hands at an average price of $0.40, a trade that won't be profitable unless Jefferies closes below $9.60 by November expiration - which happens to be tomorrow. More striking is the recent overall surge in open put contracts. Ten days ago, Jefferies' total open put interest was just under 25,000 contracts. Today, there are over 250,000 open put contracts, a ten-fold increase. Those 250,000 contracts represent 25 million shares, or nearly 20% of Jefferies' 123 million share float. To put those figures in greater context, Legg Mason has a similar float at around 135 million shares. Yet there are only 37,000 open put contacts, meaning there are open put contracts on just 3% of the float. Said Cantor Fitzgerald's Mike Khouw: ""That's a lot of bearish activity.""

But the daily numbers continue to show an economy that is stronger than most folks think. Today, for example, initial jobless claims fell to 388,000 \xe2\x80\x94 the lowest level in seven months. And the Philly Fed manufacturing index, which translates to 53 on an ISM basis, shows a very strong employment component. Earlier in the week, the index of industrial production beat estimates with an especially strong reading on business equipment. That spells strong capital-goods investment, itself a job creator. Retail sales in October also beat estimates, and are rising over 7 percent against year-ago. Both producer and consumer price inflation dropped slightly in October. Smart economists like John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros are predicting 3 percent real GDP  for Q4. Another luminary, Joe LaVorgna, thinks GDP could actually be 4 percent for the quarter ending in December. All these better readings continue to clash with market pessimism over Europe\xe2\x80\x99s debt and banking problems. Today on CNBC, however, St. Louis Fed president Jim Bullardsaid the European problem will be contained, and that it won\xe2\x80\x99t have much effect on the U.S. economy. And eminent economist Art Laffer believes the new Italian government run by Mario Monti is putting together a pro-growth economic plan to extend the retirement age of public workers, knock out 300,000 government-sector jobs, overhaul the tax system, and privatize state-owned properties. Laffer believes Monti, the former European commissioner for taxes, favors pro-growth reform and simplification. Laffer also thinks Germany will knock its budget deficit under 3 percent, with spending cuts combined with a small tax cut. In other words, the European story may not be quite as bad as the bond-market vigilantes believe. There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the Eurozone is close to recession, and that many of its members still have massive work to do. They need to live within their means, thwart the social-welfare entitlement system, and curb government-union excess. Plus there\xe2\x80\x99s the need for flatter-tax simplification to promote growth. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t help but think that whatever the state of decline in Europe may be, it is the U.S. that ultimately will benefit. Despite the class-warfare mistakes coming out of Washington and a weak-kneed supercommittee, political regime change is coming.

The mutual fund star mantle was passed to Miller from Peter Lynch, who was famous for his stewardship of the Fidelity Magellan Fund and his book, \xe2\x80\x9cOne Up on Wall Street,\xe2\x80\x9d in the 1980s.As the focus faded on the likes of Miller and Lynch, as well Mario Gabelli, Marty Whitman, Charles Royce and David Dreman, the new stars of the investing world emerged from the hedge fund industry. Names like Bill Ackman, David Einhorn and John Paulson are now the most-followed stock pickers. \xe2\x80\x9cMutual funds remind me of AOL  dial-up: a dwindling collection of old people who don't know better, contributing monthly to a comically inferior product,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phil Pearlman, investor and executive editor of StockTwits.com. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Miller was the symbolic figurehead of this beta minus fees charade.\xe2\x80\x9dEquity mutual funds, which tend to have a long-only style and a mandate to be mostly fully invested, have been a victim of a low return, high correlation world, leaving little room for the outperformance and separation that makes stars. The S&P 500 is trading around the same levels the index was at in 1999, a victim of the Internet and housing bubbles popping.\xe2\x80\x9cStars depend on market cycles and investor appetites,\xe2\x80\x9d said Michael Farr of Farr, Miller & Washington, a high net worth investment management firm. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the last decade, only higher risk (often with leverage) has produced returns.\xe2\x80\x9dHedge funds have been raking in assets at an explosive pace over the last decade because of their ability to lever up and their versatility to bet against stocks, as well as the use of more exotic instruments such as currencies and credit default swaps .Assets in hedge funds, closed to people without a minimum of $1 million to invest, grew to $1.7 trillion as of the end of the third quarter, according to BarclayHedge, an alternative investment database. Mutual fund assets were at $11 trillion as of September, down from their high of $12 trillion at the end of 2007, according to the Investment Company Institute. Greenlight Capital\xe2\x80\x99s Einhorn, Pershing Square\xe2\x80\x99s Bill Ackman and John Paulson all gained notoriety for their bets against the housing crisis. Einhorn was famously short Lehman long before its 2008 bankruptcy. Bill Miller, to the detriment of his fund\xe2\x80\x99s holders, infamously kept buying Bear Stearns before it collapsed and was sold to JPMorgan .Meanwhile, the popularity of exchange-traded funds among retail investors have shined a light on the fee structure of actively-managed stock mutual funds, the majority of which have been underperforming the S&P 500 the last decade. Assets in ETFs, which blindly mimic whole sectors and indexes are currently at around $1 trillion, up from $608 billion at the end of 2007, according to ICI.For example, Miller\xe2\x80\x99s Value Trust has an expense ratio of 1.76 percent, while the PowerShares Nasdaq 100 , among the most actively-traded ETF, has a ratio of 0.2 percent.\xe2\x80\x9cStock-picking managers haven't been able to become stars in the last five to 10 years because stock picking itself has not been a rewarding endeavor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Josh Brown, money manager and author of The Reformed Broker blog. \xe2\x80\x9cRecord high correlations and ETFization has meant that knowing which asset classes to weight more heavily and lightly has produced superior returns for fund managers who know how to do it \xe2\x80\x94 not choosing Coke  over Pepsi .\xe2\x80\x9dFor the best market insight, catch 'Fast Money' each night at 5pm ET, and the \xe2\x80\x98Halftime Report\xe2\x80\x99 each afternoon at 12:00 ET on CNBC.

701,Widening Eurozone Bond Yields Placing Increasing Pressure on Banks,Currency Contest,17-11-2011,"There have been very few developments over the past several hours and since the New York close, with market mostly locked in some quiet trade. The US Dollar remains very well bid, and any minor Greenback selling on the day thus far should not be interpreted as anything more than short-term profit taking and a temporary consolidation. We continue to recommend keeping a close watch on the ever widening Eurozone bond yields, with Italian yields above 7% and considering an assault on an alarming 8%, while Spanish yields remain under pressure following another weak auction.This would most definitely result in some form of an official, and potential coordinated response in an effort to mitigate any resulting damage to the banking system. Already, there has been an escalation in concern over the European banking system and its ability to manage through the crisis, and we have even been hearing rumors of official action on Thursday. This theme will be a critical one over the coming weeks and could expose the Euro currency to more weakness. Rating agencies are also watching closely, and any talk of downgrades will only make matters worse for local and global risk appetite.Elsewhere, the economic calendar has been equally light on Thursday, with the only key releases thus far coming from higher Aussie average weekly wages, softer UK Nationwide consumer confidence, offsetting UK retail sales, weaker Eurozone construction output and a further deterioration in Swiss ZEW. The solid UK retail sales data has however helped to prop the currency intraday, with Sterling relatively outperforming across the board.

705,"Euro Strength Misleading, More Artificial Than Authentic",Currency Contest,18-11-2011,"With all of the negative attention in the Eurozone, it is somewhat surprising to see the Euro holding up as well as it has over the past few weeks. In our opinion, this is a currency that should be trading a good deal lower and we continue to project additional declines into the lower 1.2000\xe2\x80\x99s over the coming weeks. At the moment, Eurozone peripheral bond spreads continue to widen to alarmingly high record levels, and with Italian yields next targeting the 8% mark and Spanish yields now on the verge of crossing over the 7% threshold, we do not see any light at the end of the tunnel. While Eurozone officials have been doing what they can to address the crisis, investors should be reminded that this is a big mess that involves the consent of a number of countries under one unified union before anything can ever get done. Of course, some countries are better off than others, and there is a sentiment within these stronger countries that they should not be burdened with the heavy responsibility of rescuing the other less fortunate countries. While on the surface, there exists a mask of diplomacy and desire to find a unified solution, the disjointed nature of the situation, clearly makes this an extremely challenging crisis to overcome. Recently, Dr. Doom, Nuriel Roubini was on the wires saying that it would only be a matter of time before a Greek exit, and to make matters worse, Germany\xe2\x80\x99s Merkel is still adamantly opposed to the idea of the European Central Bank becoming the lender of last resort to bail out the beleaguered, debt ridden peripheral nations. This only adds to the incredible pressure on the region, with a very limited amount of funds currently available in the EFSF. Merkel will be meeting with UK Prime Minister Cameron today, and we would expect to see some tension at the meeting with the two countries holding different views on the crisis.On the shorter-term time horizon, if the market can establish above 1.3560 on Friday, there are risks for a bit of a bounce, potentially back into the 1.3700 area. But we would be aggressively selling these rallies, as any move higher in the Euro will likely be driven by some form of official central bank or coordinated government action to help temper investor fear and stimulate the local economy. But at the end of the day, should this action then really be taken as a positive risk development and one that warrants legitimate investment in the Euro? We think not, as it only reaffirms the severity of the overall situation.Technically, we continue to defer to the EUR/USD monthly chart, which has been extremely useful this year. The market looks like it has been in a steady downtrend since positing record highs in 2008, and is now in the process of a carving out the next major lower top below 1.5000 ahead of a retest of some multi-month range lows in the lower 1.2000\xe2\x80\x99s. Once the lower 1.2000\xe2\x80\x99s are tested, it is entirely possible that we see further acceleration towards parity, but at this point, it is way too premature to make such calls and we will have to step back an reassess when the market gets down to our lower 1.2000 area objective.",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/18/euro-strength-misleading-more-artificial-than-authentic.html

A $70 billion cut would be one of the largest on record -- maybe the largest. It would show real budget discipline.

744,Finding the Cheaper Stock,Mad Money,18-11-2011,"To analyze what makes some stocks cheap and other expensive, Cramer looked at an important metric called the PEG ratio.

Share price doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, though. Cramer cares more about the price-to-earnings multiple, which shows how much investors are paying for a company\xe2\x80\x99s earnings-per-share. By this measure, Green Plains looks cheap, selling at just 6.3 times earnings while EOG sells for 22 times earnings. Yet this, too, is the wrong way to determine which is the least expensive stock.Investors need to take the growth rates into account because growth determines how big a company's earnings will be going forward in what\xe2\x80\x99s called the \xe2\x80\x9coutyears.\xe2\x80\x9d This is where the PEG ratio comes in \xe2\x80\x93 the P/E multiple divided by the growth rate. Green Plains has a 6.5 percent long-term growth rate for a PEG ratio of one. EOG has a 69 percent long-term growth rate, which gives it a PEG of just 0.3.

Today, Millennials \xe2\x80\x94 the very same young people who have been time and again called America's future \xe2\x80\x94 are 40 percent more likely to be unemployed, face chronic underemployment, and hold unprecedented college debt loads. However, despite the hardships facing our youth, a silver lining has emerged. Young people are turning toentrepreneurshipas an alternative career path and starting their own businesses in record numbers \xe2\x80\x94 solidifying the Millennial generation as the most entrepreneurial in history. According to a 2011 Youth Entrepreneurship Survey conducted by Buzz Marketing Group and the Young Entrepreneur Council, 23 percent of America's young people started a business this past year as a result of being unemployed. 15 percent started their business in college. Both of these facts clearly prove we are actively creating our own jobs, and trying to reshape America's economic landscape.

Government Must Eliminate Barriers While the government cannot guarantee small business success, it must create conditions where young entrepreneur-led businesses can launch, grow, hire and create new products. For starters, the government needs to increase the capital available through its SBA Microloan program (short-term, government-backed small business loans) and remove the regulations that prohibit startups from openly crowd-sourcing startup capital. Outreach programs need to target young people and ensure that intermediaries are not putting up road-blocks for access to these dollars due to a lack of traditional credit or collateral.

Corzine, the former Democratic governor of New Jersey. At least some of that money was used to cover trading losses at MF Global, regulators suspect, meaning the money may no longer be simply missing. It may be gone. MF Global, like other brokers, can use customer cash if it puts up sufficient collateral. But the firm did not provide enough backing in late October, essentially taking free loans, said the people briefed on the investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the inquiry was continuing.As customers rushed to withdraw money while the firm was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, that questionable borrowing worsened a liquidity crisis at the firm.It is unclear what MF Global did with all of the money or whether it can be recovered. The firm may have used some of the cash to keep its own lenders at bay, which means the money could be sitting in an account at another firm.And some of the $600 million may yet materialize. As a patchwork of federal agencies and the trustee overseeing the firm\xe2\x80\x99s liquidation reconstruct MF Global\xe2\x80\x99s books, they expect to find that in the chaotic last days the firm failed to record when some customers received their money.But a big chunk will most likely be much harder to recover, the people say, because it was used to pay off losses, rather than back trades.",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/18/mf-global-is-said-to-have-used-customer-cash-improperly.html

Here's how to trade if he does something super.You wouldn't really know it from the recent performance of the euro,  but the European debt crisis is, by many accounts, worsening. So far, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi has shown no interest in acting as the euro zone's savior, but the pressure is mounting.""Contagion is out of control at this point,"" says\xc2\xa0 Rebecca Patterson, chief markets strategist for J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Institutional, noting that even German government bonds have been selling off. But perversely, ""More and more of that will make it more and more likely that the ECB does ride to the rescue."" That should be bullish for the euro, right? Not necessarily, Patterson told CNBC's Melissa Lee. If the ECB does wade in, she says, ""They're going to cut rates, so the yield for the euro gets less attractive. They could possibly be printing money, and in theory that could create inflation fears which would weigh on the euro."" On the other hand, if the ECB were really effective, ""that would be euro positive, so it's not a clear cut trade.""That's why Patterson wants to play the possibility of an ECB rescue as a straightforward trade on risk appetite, buying the Aussie  against the dollar. She wants to wait for a pullback as conditions worsen in Europe, and buy the Australian dollar at 0.95 with a stop at 0.91. Then she would look for the ECB to act, and target a move to 1.05.Brian Kelly, cofounder and managing member of Shelter Harbor Capital, agrees with Patterson's analysis. ""If we look over the next week, it's probably going to take some kind of crisis before the ECB acts, before there is actually a deal on the table,"" he says, and ""The markets are starting to push the ECB that way.""

792,US Dollar Sell-Offs Continue to Be Very Well Absorbed,Currency Contest,21-11-2011,"We head into the new week with the USD consolidating its latest gains and perhaps under some mild pressure that is still classified as corrective and nothing more than some short-term profit taking.\xc2\xa0 Risks from here are for a fresh upside extension for the Greenback back towards and eventually through its key October highs against most major currencies. It seems as though the failure by US officials to reach a deal to reduce the massive US deficit is putting a bit of pressure on the buck early Monday, but the situation in the Eurozone is far graver at the moment and should continue to offset any US specific negative developments. Right now, the European Central Bank is holding out from a more active involvement in the EU debt crisis and it has become increasingly apparent that the EFSF will not be enough to get the job done. As such, the Euro and higher yielding currencies should remain exposed over the coming weeks withy risk liquidation themes still dominating headlines.Geopolitical uncertainty is also factoring into price action on Monday, with things heating up in the Middle East over the weekend in Egypt, Syria and Yemen. While the Yen continues to benefit from the safe-haven flows, we do recommend proceeding with caution when buying the Yen, as in our opinion, we see this currency once again at risk for a major reversal on some official action to aggressively depreciate the local currency. The Yen trades just off record highs against the Buck and some other major currencies, and we simply do not feel that the Japanese government will tolerate additional appreciation in their currency that is brought on by external factors. The idea of having to absorb a good deal of the global risk liquidation flows should not sit well with locals and we continue to see the US Dollar as the primary beneficiary going forward, with the much bigger US economy in a better position to absorb the risk liquidation flows through the US Dollar.Looking ahead, Canada wholesale sales, and US existing home sales are the key releases on the day. On the official circuit, Fed Lockhart is slated to speak later on. US equity futures and commodities are well offered, with even gold tracking a good deal lower despite the risk off trade. We speculate that some of the gold selling could be coming from government related action to help finance the current crisis. The Australian Dollar is the weakest currency thus far on the risk off trade, while Sterling is also under pressure on softer Rightmove house prices, a discouraging report from the BRC, and dovish comments from Bank of England\xe2\x80\x99s Posen.",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/21/us-dollar-selloffs-continue-to-be-very-well-absorbed.html

796,Cramer: The Bulls Have a Single Hope Left,Mad Money,21-11-2011,"A lack of progress in dealing with heavy debt in both the U.S. and Europe unnerved investors Monday, sending stocks lower for a fourth straight session. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 249 points while the S&P 500 index fell 23 points and the Nasdaq saw a 49 point decline.So are the bulls doomed for the same fate as the fattened turkey ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday?The bulls have one last hope, Jim Cramer said on Monday's ""Mad Money."" Things need to get so bad, that policymakers in both the U.S. and Europe are forced to act, he continued. Cramer expressed his displeasure in the congressional ""supercommittee,"" which has so far failed to cut $1.2 trillion from the $15 trillion national debt, even as its Wednesday deadline draws near. With a lack of a deal, Cramer worries the U.S. could face credit downgrades, as well as a rollback of unemployment benefits and hiring benefits. He's more concerned about Europe's debt woes, though.""They are the real proximate cause of the decline and will continue to be so for some time,"" Cramer said. ""In Europe, their leaders only worry about inflation when it's severe deflation from a collapse of the economy that's really at stake.""Cramer complained the European Central Bankhasn't rolled back its second rate hike from this year. While the European Union consists of 17 different countries, its central bank lives in a binary world that only offers two solutions: a slowdown or hyperinflation. To Cramer, the chances of Europe avoiding a collapse of its banking system are slim. It seems that many of its banks have to be nationalized and unfortunately, most of the losses will have to be absorbed because the Germans fear inflation. If a massive European bank nationalization wipes out trillions in investments, Cramer thinks both U.S. and European stocks are too high. The situation is fluid, though, and Cramer thinks the Germans could be scared into doing something. In the meantime, Cramer said high multiple stocks will continue to swoon. Amazon.com , Apple  and Google , for example, are benefitting from seasonality and increased demand for smartphones. International banks will continue to get pummeled, though, and he would stay away from them right now.When this story was published, Cramer's charitable trust owned Apple.Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

811,Widlitz: A Black Friday Guide to Turkey Tactics 101,The Guest Blog,21-11-2011,"Based on what I am seeing in stores leading up to Black Friday (aka 'BF') this year I am wondering if retailers really all view us as just a bunch of turkeys?With 10% of holiday sales at stake on Black Friday alone retailers have to pull out all the stops or what I call ""turkey tactics.""With sales expected to grow only modestly this holiday season, wrestling share away from the next guy is key. Hence the barrage of offers that come in many forms (plain old discounts, money back, reward points, free gift with purchase). Some of these offers are just downright confusing while others simply won\xe2\x80\x99t be available by the time you reach the front door. Turkey tactic number one. Advertise huge discounts for BF. Get that TV, DVD or smartphone you have been dreaming about at prices too good to be true. And they usually are too good to be true. Before you push back from the dinner table and bid adieu to your family to line up at 10pm for a midnight opening read the fine print. \xe2\x80\x9cQuantities are limited\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile supplies last."" In other words if you are not top ten in line chances are you are out of luck. And lets face it the competition this year will be tough. Some Best Buy  hopeful shoppers are already setting up camp outside stores. Turkey tactic number two. Staggered offers. As if 5am is not early enough doors will open early this year at midnight. Retailers seem to be under the assumption that if they open first they will steal market share. Only problem is everyone has jumped on the bandwagon. Reality is we are just stretching out the pain here rather than driving incremental sales. Employees are miserable as their holiday will be cut short (case in point the Target petition and a very sad sales person I spoke with today at Victoria\xe2\x80\x99s Secret ). And it is not enough that employees will be miserable, consumers will also feel duped as many offers this year will be staggered.

817,UBS Explores Cut in Bonus Pool ,U.S. News,21-11-2011,"UBSexecutives are considering cutting the group\xe2\x80\x99s bonus pool in an effort to recoup some of the $2.3 billion it lost in the alleged trading scandal centred on Kweku Adoboli. The Swiss bank last month opted not to eat into bonus accruals when it reported its third-quarter earnings. The approach, which meant that 90 per cent of the investment bank\xe2\x80\x99s SFr1.35 billion of third-quarter revenues was set aside for pay and bonuses, was widely criticised. Analysts said that it appeared the bank was seeking to push the cost of the trading scandal on to shareholders rather than its own employees. But Sergio Ermotti, the bank\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive, has now told the Financial Times that there was \xe2\x80\x9cno way\xe2\x80\x9d bonuses would be unaffected by the shock trading loss, allegedly racked up by a low-level trader in London. The decision could end up cutting the year-end pay and bonus pool within the investment bank \xe2\x80\x94 worth SFr4.6bn ($5bn) as at the end of September \xe2\x80\x93 by as much as 10 per cent, according to some estimates. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only debate you can have nowadays in our bank is how do you factor the $2.3bn loss into the bonus pool,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Ermotti said. Mr Adoboli, a trader on UBS\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cDelta One\xe2\x80\x9d desk, is expected to enter a plea this week on four counts of fraud and false accounting in connection with the incident.

Realtors say they expect sales to bounce around the same levels for the rest of the year, with a very slight annual gain from 2010. This sales stabilization of sorts would suggest that home prices might soon do the same, especially as inventories come down, but that has not been the case. Home prices continue to drop, especially for single family homes, which saw a hefty 5.8% price drop in October from a year ago (always measure prices year-over-year due to their heavy seasonality). The reason is that only one price segment of the market is really selling, and that segment includes the most distressed, discounted homes.

836,Why Are VCs Investing in Emerging Markets? Mobile Innovation,Global Entrepreneurship 2011,21-11-2011,"While Silicon Valley is still the epicenter of entrepreneurship and the destination for college grads who want to build a company, the venture capital that fueled the startup economy the past few decades is starting to flow elsewhere.New York and London still get the lion's share of what doesn't flow to Silicon Valley; and India and China have made substantial gains. But in the emerging markets of Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia and Philippines, investors are finding more and more reasons to invest. Rebecca Hwang, co-founder and CEO of YouNoodle, a startup that helps corporations and governments identify high-performing entrepreneurs and talent, says one reason these secondary emerging markets appeal to investors is that they are ideal testing grounds for new products, where the young population is connected to social media. \xe2\x80\x9cCountries like Malaysia, Vietnam, Philippines and Indonesia have great technical and entrepreneurial talent,\xe2\x80\x9d notes Hwang. Hwang helped to organize Startup Malaysia, held in Kuala Lumpur in October, and has assisted the Malaysian government in investing in tech entrepreneurs. She says she has been receiving an increase in queries from government leaders in Asia and South America to find companies and entrepreneurs who are based in secondary emerging markets.

837,Four Tech Stocks for 2012 ,CNBC Stock Blog,21-11-2011,"Earlier this month, Groupon netted $700 million in an IPO despite scrutiny over its accounting metrics and concerns about its long-term ability to turn a profit.The offering was the largest since Google's  in 2004, as Groupon ended a dearth of IPOs in the last several months and opened up the doors for a slew of other high-profile companies to toss their hats into the ring.""Groupon was the 800-pound gorilla everyone was waiting to see go out of the gates,"" said Lee Simmons, an analyst with Dun & Bradstreet. ""They had such a strong showing it opened the gates even further for a flood of these IPOs to come down the pipeline."" Last Thursday, consumer reviews siteAngie's List raised $114 million in its IPO. Shares opened at $18, nearly 40 percent higher than its initial offer price.On the same day, user review site counterpart Yelp filed for a $100 million IPO. Both Angie's List and Yelp are unprofitable.Social gaming company Zynga also filed for an IPO and is rumored to be going out after Thanksgiving. The FarmVille creator could boast the biggest offering yet as it looks to raise up to $1 billion.As the market for tech IPO heats up, so does investor enthusiasm for the sector as a whole.A recent study by Silicon Valley law firm Fenwick & West showed ""up rounds"" exceeded down rounds for venture financings 70 percent to 15 percent, meaning the price per share at which companies sold their stock has increased since their prior funding round.We take a look at several newly public tech stocks, how they've performed this year and what analysts are expecting going into 2012.1. PandoraOnline radio company Pandora debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on June 15 with shares surging more than 63 percent. The company raised $235 million in its IPO, selling shares at $16 apiece.During its most recent quarter, the company reported an adjusted profit of 2 cents a share on revenue of $67 million. Analysts had expected Pandora to break even on a per share basis on revenue of $60 million.Despite topping analysts' estimates, the company has faced skepticism about its ability to turn a profit as well as its power to fend off stiff competition from tech giants like Amazon.com and Google, as well as upstarts like Spotify, all which are trying to gain market share in the online music space.These concerns have sent Pandora shares sliding nearly 30 percent, closing Friday at $12.88. The company will report its third-quarter earnings on Nov. 22. Analysts are expecting a loss of 1 cents a share and revenue of $71 million. Analysts believe much of Pandora's growth will come from its mobile business.Around half of Pandora's advertising revenue came from mobile devices last quarter, the first period that the company has reached this milestone, Pandora said.""The recent rise of smartphone and tablets as mobile platforms that Pandora can take advantage of should be a strong driver of listener hours and advertising revenue as the penetration of these devices continues to expand,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Edward Williams wrote in a recent analyst note.Pandora lets listeners create personalized radio stations based on their tastes. Listeners can then provide feedback by selecting ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"" to influence the types of songs that are played going forward.The service is available for free through the Web, tablets and smartphones and is also integrated into the sound systems of several car makers.The company's iPad app is the most downloaded free app in the history of Apple's  App Store and its iPhone app is the second-most popular, following Facebook.2. LinkedIn\xc2\xa0 When professional networking site LinkedIn debuted on the NYSE in May, shares opened at $83, double the initial offer price.The first high-profile tech firm to go after an IPO in months, LinkedIn signaled a turning point for the sector. While shares of LinkedIn have cooled since then \xe2\x80\x94 they closed Friday at $72 \xe2\x80\x94 the stock still remains strong.Last week, LinkedIn completed a secondary offering, raising $88 million and doubling the number of shares available in the public markets. The selling shareholders included Bain Capital which sold all of its 3.7 million shares, around 4.2 percent of the company.During the most recent quarter ended in September, LinkedIn said it has grown its membership base to 131.2 million, an increase of 63 percent from the same period last year. The company reported its first quarterly loss since going public, while revenue more than doubled to $139.5 million, sparking concern that the company is overspending.Analysts believe much of LinkedIn's growth will come from new products, particularly as the company opens up its platform to third-party application providers.In April, LinkedIn announced it was releasing plug-ins that developers could integrate with their own Web sites which allows users to share articles with the LinkedIn community, view member profiles and browse company data.""To sustain robust revenue growth rates, the company will need to have to move beyond simple hiring solutions and enter new markets,"" Morningstar analyst Rick Summer wrote in an analyst note.3. Fusion-io\xc2\xa0 Fusion-io, which makes products that improve data-center efficiency, scored big in its June IPO.The company, whose biggest customer is Facebook, priced its offering at $19, north of its projected range of $16 to $18 a share. Fusion-io has seen its shares jump a whopping 78 percent since its IPO debut. Shares closed Friday at $36.90.In its most recently quarter, ended in September, the company reported revenue of $75 million, almost double its sales from the same period last year.Last week, Fusion-io said it will offer three million common shares as part of a secondary offering.4. BankrateBankrate, which provides personal finance information such as mortgage rates and online calculators, is seeing a strong return following its June IPO. Shares are up over 30 percent this year after pricing at $15 a share on the NYSE.During the most recent quarter ended in September, revenue grew 60 percent to $113 million. Adjusted profit jumped 55 percent to $36 million.Last week, Stifel analyst Jordan Rohan upped his price target on Bankrate to $24 from $21, citing demand for its mortgage products and credit card business.The company's acquisition of InsWeb's insurance lead generation and marketing business last month for $65 million is also expected to propel growth.Shares of Bankrate, a CNBC.com partner, closed Friday at $19.97.______________________________CNBC Data Pages:Dow 30 Stocks\xe2\x80\x94In Real Time Oil, Gold, Natural Gas Prices Now Where's the US Dollar Today?Track Treasury Prices Here______________________________ Disclosures:TheStreet's editorial policy prohibits staff editors, reporters and analysts from holding positions in any individual stocks.Disclaimer",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/21/four-tech-stocks-for-2012.html

Chris Fernandes, vice president and forex advisor for Bank of the West, says Europeans realize this - and if they consider the history of past currency disasters, they'll see it's in their interest to keep the euro zone together.""Look at the example of Argentina when they had to default"" and devalue the currency, and then endure a run on banks, massive capital flight, and political unrest. ""Despite the missteps and bickering, there is a firm commitment to the euro zone, and the euro zone will survive and stay intact,"" he told me. Fernandes points out that in a recent survey of Greek citizens, close to 70% wanted to stay in the euro zone, even though they were angry at the proposed reforms.Still, Fernandes expects the turmoil to continue for some time. So even though the euro has held up surprisingly well, thanks partly to banks repatriating funds and traders' reluctance to get caught short, ""there is definite downside pressure now,"" Fernandes says, and he's on the sidelines.

Maybe that's why Rome got its moniker, but having covered the fall of Berlusconi and the rise of Monti's technocrats, there's some relief things moved along quicker than I and investors feared. Less than two weeks ago it was still conceivable Silvio might hang around until elections in February, but there's nothing like a bond market blowout to concentrate minds; 24 hours later the Prime Minister was stepping down.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At that point the ECB decided to step in to bring yields back down again, hitting 6.3 percent last Monday. But then with signs of Monti having problems getting cross-party approval for the makeup of his Cabinet, the ECB sat back and yields started to rise. On Wednesday, Monti had his cabinet, confidence votes were assured and the ECB was again in heavily trying to cap the increase. The pattern is set. Do the right thing and you'll get support, don't and you're on your own. It's a strong arm strategy that we first saw used over Greece. Here Europe's leaders moved from doing whatever was necessary to protect the euro, to publicly saying yes it's possible to leave. But this is a high risk strategy.Admitting the euro can break up means investors will start pricing that in, which is exactly what's happening with rising core bond yields. The biggest danger is that this fast becomes a runaway train that nobody can stop. Germany refuses to countenance the answer is fiscal transfer. For them the ultimate end is fiscal union where all budgets have been centrally approved and to qualify every member has become like them. Now, quite apart from whether this is the right economic structure for Europe, (when everyone starts saving like Germany, who's going to buy German goods?) the big issue is how do we get to this utopia. The Germans insist it's only by wince-inducing reform. Belt tightening and budget slashing will have to come on top of recession and youth unemployment rates that are already well over 40 percent in Spain and Greece, and close to 30 percent in \xc2\xa0Ireland, Portugal and Italy. But the Germans and the Eurocrats have a theory. By and large the people of Europe will put up with anything to keep the euro if they can sell the idea that the crisis will be used to create the type of currency zone we should have had in the first place. Recent polls in Greece showing 70 percent want to stay in the euro are proof to them of a willingness to accept the sacrifices. Even in Italy, faith in their politicians and political system is so low quite a few individuals told me they'd be happy to have the Germans run things, on the basis that at least the sums would add up and there'd be no corruption. It's quite a theory; I've got a feeling it will be tested to destruction.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/21/germans-may-end-up-running-the-eternal-city.html

On last Friday's Options Action, we suggested a bearish bet on Hewlett-Packard as the tech giants heads into tonight's earnings. Current prices for puts and calls imply a 5% move, which is slightly less than the company's average move of 5.5% over the last eight quarters. Last week the stock got a nice bid after the company appointed activist investor Ralph Whitworth to the board. But despite Whitworth's great year, Dan Nathan of Riskreversal.com decided to fade the move, and bought the weekly November 27/25 put spread for $0.45, a bearish strategy that could be worth $1.55 if Hewlett trades below $25 by the end of this week.

The deficit supercommittee has failed, and Willie Williams, director of global macro institutional sales at Societe Generale, says it won't be just the U.S. economy feeling the pain.\xc2\xa0 ""We think the fiscal drag from just not having that stimulus is about 1.5%,"" he told me alluding to the $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts the stalemate triggers. ""So if you're expecting 1% growth, and you get that 1.5% drag, the U.S. goes back into recession. We will now have fiscal drag coming out of the U.S. and Europe at a time when the global economy is struggling a bit to keep firing on all cylinders.""A weaker economy generally is a good thing for the dollar,\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0but as for other currencies, Williams says, ""I think this is a negative for commodity currencies, anything that will have an impact on growth."" He singles out the Canadian dollar\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0because of that country's extensive trading ties to the U.S., and the Australian dollar,  which will feel the effect of a weaker U.S. economy along with some slowing down in China.Selling the Australian dollar against the Japanese yen  is a favorite trade of Williams' right now, but that's not your only option.

863,Tough Times for November TV Sweeps ,Media Money with Julia Boorstin,22-11-2011,"The broadcast networks continue to push for ratings, this year with social media promotions -- CBS ran a ""Tweet Week"" to encourage people to tune in, in real time. There's a reason why Regis Philbin's last show and the American Music Awards were scheduled for Sweeps -- the networks still pull out all the stops. But nothing speaks to the diminishing importance of 'Sweeps' than the fact that cable no longer holds back during this once intimidating month. They've been debuting new shows, like AMC's 'The Walking Dead' instead of waiting for periods in the summer and winter when broadcast air time sat relatively fallow. Why? They're no longer afraid to compete with broadcast-- the Walking Dead has been averaging well over six million viewers, while FX and USA both regularly hit the three to four million range. That's certainly comparable with some of the lower-rated broadcast shows this season. So who won this month's sweeps? Of the broadcast networks CBS came out on top, but the real winners seem to be AMC, FX and USA, plus ESPN, with Monday Night Football. The broadcasters aren't just facing challenges from cable-- they're facing advertising headwinds as well. The advertising market, which was strong through the third quarter, has weakened significantly in November. Last minute -- or ""scatter"" --- ad prices are down by mid-single digits. And as economic uncertainty continues, scatter pricing is expected to drop even further in the first half of 2012. We'll see whether things stabilize in time for the all-important 'Upfront' season when networks try to lock in sales for the coming year. If cable ratings are any indication, cable will continue to make gains on broadcast.

871,Euro Could Rally Back Above 1.3700 Before Renewed Selling,Currency Contest,22-11-2011,"The Euro continues to defy gravity and for the time being, has managed to hold above some key short-term support at 1.3420. Market participants are perplexed with the ability for the currency to hold up despite a plethora of Eurozone negative developments, the latest of which being warnings from Moody\xe2\x80\x99s on France\xe2\x80\x99s credit rating. The infection from the periphery has officially spread to the core economy and we see no evidence of amelioration any time soon. Overall risks to the global economy are also tilted to the downside and our core bullish US Dollar outlook remains firmly intact as we look for the Greenback to continue to build momentum over the coming weeks and months.We even project USD upside against the Yen, with the Japanese currency at risk for some official intervention to offset the rapid appreciation we have seen in the Yen over the past few years. FinMin Azumi was on the wires earlier in the day and warned of the potential for more government intervention to weaken the Yen. Elsewhere, market participants have been paying attention to comments from the World Bank that China faces growing risks from the Eurozone debt crisis, with any slowdown in China likely to have a more debilitating effect on the global recovery.We continue to forecast this scenario and see a major slowdown in China representing the third wave of the global recession. We have been buying the Euro against the higher-yielding Aussie because of this, as we see risks that have already been priced into the Euro being excluded from the Chnia-correlated Aussie. The long EUR/AUD trade from 1.3300 is starting to pick up steam and we see room for a major upside appreciation towards the 1.6000 area over the coming months.Technically, we continue to defer to the EUR/USD monthly chart, which has been extremely useful this year. The market looks like it has been in a steady downtrend since positing record highs in 2008, and is now in the process of a carving out the next major lower top below 1.5000 ahead of a retest of some multi-month range lows in the lower 1.2000\xe2\x80\x99s. Once the lower 1.2000\xe2\x80\x99s are tested, it is entirely possible that we see further acceleration towards parity, but at this point, it is way too premature to make such calls and we will have to step back an reassess when the market gets down to our lower 1.2000 area objective.CAVEAT: Over the coming sessions, there is however risk for some short-term selling in the buck on broad based buying of currencies. Fundamentally, it is difficult to reconcile the prospect of a currency rally in the current market environment, but perhaps some behind the scenes coordinated action to prop the Eurozone economy could be helping to keep market supported for now. This could then translate in a move for the Euro back above 1.3700, which in turn will prop the broader market, including other risk correlated assets like global equities. Another consideration to price action over he coming days needs to be the anticipated lightened trade into US Thanksgiving holiday. Markets are always funny around these times and often react in counterintuitive ways. As such, the strategy should be to look to only buy the US Dollar on additional dips or on a break to fresh multi-day highs beyond the previous weekly highs. Anything in between is viewed as choppy directionless consolidation.Looking ahead, the economic calendar picks up into North America, with US GDP and Canada retail sales due early on, followed by the release of the FOMC Minutes into the North American afternoon. On the official circuit, Fed Kocherlakota is slated to speak in Canada.

872,CVS Stands to Benefit From Walgreen Dispute,Mad Money,21-11-2011,"Cramer is concerned that Europe's mounting debt crisis could send the U.S. into a recession. By the same token, he's concerned about investors who won't be in the market when the debt problems are solved and stocks rebound. He recommends investors not only high-yielding stocks, but defensive stocks, too.Take CVS Caremark , for example. Cramer thinks the drug store operator and pharmacy benefit manager is as recession resistant as it gets.""CVS is exactly the kind of secure, consistent company that will work even if Europe sends us into a recession, even if Washington continues to falter,"" Cramer said, adding the Woonsocket, R.I.-based company could also soon get business from rival Walgreen .Walgreen is currently disputing the terms of its contract with Express Scripts , the U.S.'s largest pharmacy benefit manager. Walgreen wants to charge more than Express Scripts is willing to pay, Cramer said. If both parties can't come to terms by end-year, 90 million prescriptions will need to be filled elsewhere. Cramer thinks CVS stands to benefit given it's the U.S.'s second-largest pharmacy chain with 38 percent of its stores overlapping with Walgreen.Given these events, Cramer has warmed up to CVS, even though the stock is less than 2 points off its 52-week high. The stock currently sells at 11.8 times forward earnings with a 10.5 percent long-term growth rate, but Cramer thinks it could get a higher multiple after its analyst day on December 20.

He highlighted the technology sector in particular.Most tech stocks have been hammered lately, Cramer noted, because they do so much business in Europe. The charts on most of these stocks are terrible, but a few are holding up, like Qualcomm . The wireless technology company owns most of the technology that enables 3G and 4G communications, so it's benefitting from increased demand for smartphones.Cramer wanted to dive deeper into Qualcomm's chart, so he sought the help of Carolyn Boroden, a highly regarded technician on Wall Street.

880,Blog: Cairo in Turmoil: the Egyptian Revolution Part Two ,The Guest Blog,22-11-2011,"For the second time within 11 months the eyes of the White House and the world are focused on Cairo. Tahrir Square in the middle of this bustling and impoverished city of 20 million is full of young people chanting slogans of freedom and liberty. The bangs of exploding tear gas canisters and the frequent rush of people carrying injured compatriots back to hastily arranged field hospitals are frightening. Every so often protestors come running away from the frontline at the eastern side of the square to escape the vicious tear gas clouds, the plastic bullets and the charge of the well-armed police officers in their black uniforms. A particularly brutal charge, at 5pm on Sunday, led to more than 30 deaths and hundreds of injured. It appears that live ammunition was used. Still, after only 30 minutes the police were forced to retreat again from Tahrir Square. In response to the killings, the day after, on Monday, an even larger crowd descended on Tahrir Squareto show their defiance. Who are the protestors and what do they want? Among the protestors there are many supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Salafis, an even more extreme Islamic party. But there are also Coptic Christians and a good number of liberal groups. The police violence of the last few days has united these diverse unarmed groups into a common movement which, however, is devoid of any real leadership and proper organization. The young protestors are calling for the introduction of democracy and an elected civilian government. The square echoes with the chants demanding the ouster of Field Marshal Tantawi, the chairman of the Supreme Council of the Army, and the end of the rule of the military elite that in one way or another has been in charge of Egypt since Gamal Abdel Nasser's bloody 1952 coup. The revolution that began on January 25, 2011, and led to the downfall of long-standing Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak just over two weeks later has entered its second and perhaps decisive stage. After all, nothing much has changed in Egypt since Mubarak's ouster. His disciples are still in power, the Egyptian economy has further deteriorated, corruption is as bad as ever and Mubarak's torture chambers continue functioning well with more than 12,000 civilians having been put in front of military tribunals since February. The Mubarak-era 'emergency laws' have still not been repealed. The all powerful Egyptian military is resolved at all costs to avoid relinquishing power and becoming subservient to a democratic civilian government. The resignation of the interim cabinet on Monday has not changed this. ",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/22/blog-cairo-in-turmoil-the-egyptian-revolution-part-two.html

882,Pepper-Spraying Cop Inspires T-Shirt,Small Business,22-11-2011,"Being quick to capitalize on what's happening in the zeitgeist is the mark of a true business person.One fast-thinking clothing artist did it last night when he created a T-shirt using an image based on the UC Davis campus police officer who casually pepper-sprayed passive protesters during an Occupy Wall Street demonstration last week on the California campus.The incident, first broadcast on TV, went viral on the Web, and is now a meme that has Photoshop experts adding the pepper-spraying cop tosuch familiar scenes as Jimmy Stewart and Mr. Potter in ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" and the Beatles crossing Abbey Road. Then, when someone posted on Reddit a depiction of the cop spraying butterflies out of a can, calling it ""Casually Butterfly Everything,"" people enthusiastically replied, requesting decals, T-shirts and more. And someone complied. ""I saw the 'casually butterfly everything' pic, so I stayed up until 1:30 to make this,"" posted the anonymous T-shirt artist. At first, it was made available on Reddit to anyone who emailed the artist. Soon, overloaded with requests, a shop was set up on Etsy, a site for craftspeople to sell their goods. Offered for $8, with $2 shipping fee, the shirts sold out within hours, with the promise that more would be available soon. Not bad for a few hours work. One question: does the original artist get a cut?

892,Blame Declines on Political Gridlock,Mad Money,22-11-2011,"U.S. stocks ended lower Tuesday with the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq logging a fifth-consecutive day of declines, as investors remain cautious over uncertainty surrounding heavy debt concerns in both the U.S. and Europe. To Cramer, American and European policymakers' lack of progress in dealing with heavy debt both regions has further sapped investor confidence in equities.As a congressional committee failed to reach a deal to cut budget deficits, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 249 points. The deadlock raised fears that rating agencies might lower the U.S. government's credit rating if Congress tries to circumvent the automatic spending cuts that are supposed to occur in the event of an impasse. Some Republicans have said they would try to block cuts to defense spending.In Europe, there were more signs of trouble surrounding its debt crisis. Spain was forced to pay sharply higher interest rates in an auction of short-term debt. The higher rates suggest that investors are still skeptical that the country will get its budget under control despite a new, center-right government coming to power this week. Investors have been worried that Spain could become the next country to need financial support from its European neighbors if its borrowing rates climb to unsustainable levels. Greece was forced to seek relief from its lenders after its long-term borrowing rates rose above 7 percent on the bond market. The rate on Spain's own benchmark 10-year bond is dangerously close to that level, 6.58 percent.""I have never seen leaders here or in Europe do so much damage in the name of doing so much good,"" Cramer complained. ""Business people around the globe are paralyzed by the indecision, the bickering, the lack of resolve of their leaders. No matter what positive steps business takes they seem always to be counteracted by the very people they elected and choose to lead them.""Cramer thinks policymakers should act quickly. President Barack Obama, for instance, could get behind natural gas as an alternative fuel because it's cleaner, cheaper and more abundant than foreign oil. Washington could also provide some certainty on whether or not taxes will be raised, or whether unemployment benefits will be extended. Until lawmakers start to lead, Cramer thinks the market will suffer further declines.CNBC.com with wire reportsCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

If history is a guide, the euro  could offer up some gifts. For the past twenty years, the euro has been one of the currencies most likely to deviate positively from its trading pattern in December, thanks to portfolio managers trying to gussy up their holdings by taking on more risk. Data from Consensus Economics, a macroeconomic survey firm, has the euro ticking up 0.4%, on average, while the dollar  tends to maintain and the Canadian dollar  and British pound  weaken. (The Swiss franc  also tends to strengthen, measured in this case against the euro, but with the Swiss National Bank intervening so forcefully this year, all bets are off.)You can check out the patterns in this Consensus Economics chart:Still, this isn't exactly a normal year in Europe, and Andrew Busch, global currency and public policy strategist for BMO Capital Markets, is doubtful that the seasonal effect will amount to much. ""There are just too many things going on"" this year, he told CNBC's Melissa Lee. Rebecca Patterson, chief markets strategist for J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Institutional, says the typical year end pattern ""tends to weigh on the dollar and support risk currencies, including the euro.""

While commodity prices took a beating along with the Dow, which closed down 2.1 percent, \xe2\x80\x9cMad Money\xe2\x80\x9d host Jim Cramer went bullish on gold, which closed below $1,700 an ounce. Spot gold declined 3.1 percent at $1,671.49 an ounce while U.S. gold futures  dropped $46.50 to $1,678.60 an ounce.\xe2\x80\x9cThe vicious decline in gold is signaling the collapse of the current financial order, an order that\xe2\x80\x99s based on printing money to cover up problems,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.

927,Don\xe2\x80\x99t Trust Buybacks,Mad Money,23-11-2011,"Cramer used to be a big fan of companies who repurchased their shares on the open market. He thought they were a good way to reward shareholders because the buybacks boosted the stock price. But a lot of these deals haven\xe2\x80\x99t returned the value he thought they would, and in some cases they\xe2\x80\x99ve been \xe2\x80\x9ca gigantic waste of corporate money,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.Since the crash of 2008 there have been a number of companies that bought back their stock at higher prices, leaving shareholders with nothing to show for the billions spent doing it. The health-maintenance organizations might be the worst offenders. Instead of paying dividends, Aetna , WellPoint  and Unitedhealth Group  used that money to finance massive buybacks \xe2\x80\x94 even though in some cases insiders were selling at the same time.In the end, the buybacks did nothing for the stocks. And what\xe2\x80\x99s worse, they left on the table what would have been yielding more than 4 percent if these companies had poured the money into dividends. That\xe2\x80\x99s the level at which all dividend-paying companies become more attractive to investors, Cramer said, and a flurry of buying might have provided the share-price support they had originally wanted.So why do CEOs like buybacks so much? Remember, a company\xe2\x80\x99s earnings-per-share is its net income divided by the total number of shares. So the repurchase of stock is a cheap way to boost the EPS.Also, CEOs often try to call a bottom in their company\xe2\x80\x99s stock by announcing a buyback. But this shows a lack of understanding of how the market works, because the share price will continue to plummet as long as the business is in decline.Cramer dispelled the myth that buybacks can cushion a stock\xe2\x80\x99s fall in a bear market. Unfortunately, short sellers these days wield too much power, enough to overwhelm even the most well-intentioned company. Especially because there are rules about how much stock a company can buy back on a given day. Meanwhile, the regulations that used to keep short sellers in check disappeared while Christopher Cox was running the Securities and Exchange Commission. In sum, you never want to own the stock of a company that\xe2\x80\x99s wasting the money it needs to survive on useless buybacks. Or worse, spending money it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have on them. And never rely on even the largest repurchase plan to help prop up a stock. \xe2\x80\x9cThe way I see it,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom now on, buybacks [are a] false sign of health and too often a waste of shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 money.\xe2\x80\x9dWritten by Tom Brennan; Edited by Drew SandholmCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

937,Buying the Right Sell-Off Stocks,Mad Money,23-11-2011,"There are two specific kinds of stocks Cramer looks for during a sell-off: those knocked from their highs and those that pay dividends. The more brutal the sell-off, he said, the more attractive these stocks tend to look.The new-high list is always a great place to look for investments. After all, stocks usually don\xe2\x80\x99t make it there for no reason, Cramer said. But a stock that\xe2\x80\x99s hit a new high can be expensive, turning off interested traders. A correction takes care of that dilemma, though. If a market dip is the only reason the share price has dropped, chances are the stock is solid. So those are exactly the kinds of companies Cramer suggests you look for because they tend to rebound the fastest when the market turns up. The caveat here is that not all stocks pushed off the new-high list are worth buying. In fact, often times they\xe2\x80\x99re the companies leading the sell-off. Investors have to do their homework to figure out which stocks are worth owning and which aren't.Cramer also searches for dividend-paying stocks during a correction. When the market declines, and with it the share prices of these stocks, yields go up. (Remember: A $1 dividend on a $20 stock has a 5 percent yield. The yield on a $10 stock with a $1 dividend is 10 percent.) And while dividends aren\xe2\x80\x99t sexy, he admitted, they put money in your pocket during the hard times of a sell-off. This, of course, is based on the notion that a company has no intention of cutting its dividend. That\xe2\x80\x99s why you never buy a damaged company just because the yield has skyrocketed. Damaged companies might cut their dividends. Companies with damaged stocks probably won\xe2\x80\x99t. Cramer\xe2\x80\x99s rule of thumb: If the company\xe2\x80\x99s expected earnings are twice the size of the dividend payment, then the dividend should be reasonably safe. A sell-off is an opportunity to buy, Cramer said, especially stocks that have just pulled off their highs, and stocks with dividends that have grown larger thanks to the decline.Written by Tom Brennan; Edited by Drew SandholmCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

942,Fratto: Does Anyone Really Care About the Supercommittee?,The Guest Blog,23-11-2011,"For all the supercharged attention leading up to the non-report from the congressional supercommittee on deficit reduction, it's hard to come to any other conclusion that \xe2\x80\x94 for now, at least \xe2\x80\x94 no one really cares. We did see a downdraft in markets following Congress' failure to produce a plan to reduce long-term deficits \xe2\x80\x94 as we did following the debt limit increase, but these were coincidental events: global markets are reacting to developments (or lack thereof, in Europe). It's clear that the Eurozone is either in, or about to enter, a prolonged recession, and its sovereign debt woes could even lead to an ultimate break-up of the monetary union. As for America's own sovereign debt woes, they remain for the future. For now, a flight to safety in this turbulent and volatile economy really means a flight to liquidity. And there simply is no more liquid place to be than the U.S. treasury market. Where else are you going to go? German bunds? Not so fast. Germany saw today how quickly market sentiment can change, experiencing a severely undersubscribed 10-year bond auction \xe2\x80\x93 an ominous sign. Other potential flight-to-safety markets are insufficiently liquid and/or \xe2\x80\x94 as in the case of Switzerland \xe2\x80\x94 unwilling to accept the resultant currency strengthening. As long as liquidity is king, the U.S. will be able to sell its debt at favorable rates. This is the great irony of running up $15 trillion of debt: the enormous U.S. treasury market presents to global market participants the one place they can park or access cash on a relatively risk-free basis. This ""service"" to global investors is today afar more valuable exorbitant privilege than even the related fact of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency. Combined with the Fed's monetary policy actions, the need (not desire) to buy U.S. securities has delivered us a 10-year note yield hovering at around 2% -- cheap money for Treasury's debt managers, and correspondingly lower borrowing rates for U.S. consumers and businesses. So the collapse of efforts to even marginally put America on a better fiscal path is being met, dangerously, with a collective shrug. U.S. officials are comfortable postponing significant deficit reduction measures until after the 2012 elections at the earliest, seemingly indifferent to the possibility that the world could change. Over the near-term, this complacency is being undeservedly rewarded. Volatility and hyper-liquidity needs will be with us for a while. Resolving, or perhaps restructuring, the EU is a long process, and there are credible reasons to prepare for a crisis in China. King Liquidity could have a long reign. The bad news is that the longer the U.S. delays addressing its debt burden, the greater the likelihood of disruptive eventsonce global markets stabilize and the search for liquidity is replaced by asearch for yield. Market participants can't be expected to effectively pay the U.S. Treasury to warehouse their cash forever. The long-term price of today\xe2\x80\x99s indifference is one rate that will keep rising.

946,"New Delhi, Now More Polluted Than Beijing",Business News,22-11-2011,"India has recently pulled far ahead of China on one dubious development marker \xe2\x80\x94 air pollution in the country\xe2\x80\x99s capital.The air quality in New Delhi on Monday afternoon was significantly worse than the air quality in Beijing, according to real-time air monitors run by the Indian and U.S.\xc2\xa0 governments in both cities.New Delhi, a landlocked, fast-growing metropolis of more than 16 million people, is regularly shrouded by haze and smog (sometimes euphemistically referred to as fog) in winter months, as barometric pressure and cooler air mix with construction dust, smoke from cow dung fires and car exhaust, which then hover over the city for days.But this year, the air quality in New Delhi has seemed noticeably worse than previous years as the summer heat dissipates. On Monday, a thick gray haze hung over Delhi\xe2\x80\x99s taller buildings, and a visible film formed quickly on stationary objects, leaving a chemical taste and grime on the skin.The air feels thick because it is heavy with debris and pollution.According to a Web site (use the \xe2\x80\x9cAir Quality online\xe2\x80\x9d link) run by the government of India\xe2\x80\x99s Ministry of Earth Sciences that takes air quality samples hourly from several spots around New Delhi, Air Quality Index, or A.Q.I. measures for the tiniest measures of particulates, known as PM 2.5, were well above 300 on Monday afternoon, a level judged to be \xe2\x80\x9cvery poor\xe2\x80\x9d in India and \xe2\x80\x9chazardous\xe2\x80\x9d in other countries.These particulates, so named because they are 2.5 microns or smaller, are especially dangerous because they can travel deep into the lungs, causing serious respiratory problems.\xc2\xa0 They can be caused by car exhaust, burning coal and chemical plants.Cooling temperatures are trapping air pollution created by a rising number of cars, which is being supplemented by dusty winds from the northwest, said G. Beig, the program director of the air monitoring program at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.The A.Q.I. is an index used to measure various different pollutants which ranges from 0 to 500, with 500 being the highest level of pollution. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies an overall A.Q.I. over 201 as \xe2\x80\x9cvery unhealthy\xe2\x80\x9d and any A.Q.I. over 301 as \xe2\x80\x9chazardous.\xe2\x80\x9d A.Q.I. levels over 301 \xe2\x80\x9cwould trigger health warnings of emergency conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d the E.P.A. says, with the \xe2\x80\x9centire population\xe2\x80\x9d likely to be affected.When related specifically to particulate pollution, the EPA considers any A.Q.I. figure over 151 \xe2\x80\x9cunhealthy,\xe2\x80\x9d and over 201 as \xe2\x80\x9cvery unhealthy,\xe2\x80\x9d and cautions older people and children should stay indoors, and everyone should avoid heavy exertion.The A.Q.I. for PM 2.5 at the India Meteorological Department\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters in central Delhi was 320 on Monday afternoon, the Indian Web site said, and the A.Q.I. at the National Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting in Noida, a Delhi suburb, was 380.In Beijing, in contrast, the A.Q.I. for these small particulates on Monday was below 200 for much of the day, according to a Twitter feed run by the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, which measures air hourly.A database recently published by the World Health Organization also shows New Delhi with higher pollution levels than Beijing, but that database relies on official government figures. Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s government has been criticized for down-playing the city\xe2\x80\x99s pollution problems, and recently began tours of its air monitoring facilities.Delhi\xe2\x80\x99s Pollution Control Board did not immediately respond to calls for comment Monday afternoon.",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/22/new-delhi-now-more-polluted-than-beijing.html

957,Developing Your Inner Innovator,The Future of Innovation,23-11-2011,"Years ago, Arnold Glasow, an entrepreneur and humorist, concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cimprovement begins with I.\xe2\x80\x9d We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree more when it comes to becoming an innovative leader. Our book, The Innovator\xe2\x80\x99s DNA, distills the results of our research on how the most innovative leaders at the most innovative companies in the world develop disruptive ideas. Our interviews with over 100 high profile innovators (like Jeff Bezos at Amazon) and surveys of more than 5,000 executives and entrepreneurs uncovered five powerful discovery skills.\xc2\xa0Innovators question the status quo, observe like anthropologists, network for new ideas, and experiment by trying out new things, taking things apart, and testing out prototypes. Then they engage in associational thinking by connecting the unconnected to get innovative solutions. In short, innovators consistently act differently to think differently.To start, we suggest three steps. 1) Assess your discovery skills strengths; 2) Identify a compelling innovation challenge that matters, and 3) Practice your discovery skills ruthlessly. When combined, these steps can help you \xe2\x80\x94 and your team \xe2\x80\x94 build the relevant innovation skills required to make a bigger, better impact at work and beyond. Step 1: Assess Your Discovery SkillsTo get a quick snapshot of how strong your discovery skills are today, take a moment to answer the following 10 questions.\xc2\xa0 Remember to answer based on your actual behaviors, not what you would like to do. (You can also visit this web site to complete a more comprehensive 70-item online self-assessment or a 360-assessment to get a more refined, specific sense of your discovery skill strengths.)Assessing Your Overall Discovery Skill Strength1 = strongly disagree; 2 = disagree; 3 = neither agree nor disagree; 4 = agree; 5 = strongly agreeFrequently, my ideas or perspectives diverge radically from others\xe2\x80\x99 perspectives.I regularly ask questions that challenge the status quo.New ideas often come to me when I am directly observing how people interact with products and services.I often find solutions to problems by drawing on solutions or ideas developed in other industries, fields, or disciplines.I frequently experiment to create new ways of doing things.I regularly talk with a diverse set of people (e.g., from different business functions, organizations, industries, geographies, etc.) to find and refine new ideas.I attend conferences (on my areas of expertise as well as unrelated areas) to meet new people and understand what issues are facing them.I actively seek to identify emerging trends by reading books, articles, magazines, blogs and so on.I frequently ask \xe2\x80\x9cwhat if\xe2\x80\x9d questions that provoke exploration of new possibilities and frontiers.I regularly observe the activities of customers, suppliers or other organizations to get new ideas.To score your survey, add your scores together from all 10 items. You score very high on discovery skills if your total score is 45 or above, high on discovery if your score is 40\xe2\x80\x9345, moderate to high on discovery if your score is between 35 and 40, moderate to low if you score 29\xe2\x80\x9334; you score low on discovery if your score is 28 or less.",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/23/developing-your-inner-innovator.html

961,Farr: No Super in This Committee,The Guest Blog,23-11-2011,"It\xe2\x80\x99s easier to celebrate Thanksgiving in Washington, DC - not only are we surrounded by the symbols of liberty and democracy, but the politicians all leave for home. Peace and dignity settle on our stunning parks and monuments, and residents are reminded that this is a magnificent place.For non-DC dwellers, we wonder what reception you will extend to your returning representatives. They\xe2\x80\x99ve done such a fine job. Since the last time you saw them, the debt ceiling stalemate led to a downgrade of our national debt, unemployment remains above 9%, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s indebtedness is growing daily, and profligate spending continues at full speed. All of the sound and fury around the Dodd Frank law have not protected us from MF Global\xe2\x80\x99s 44:1 leveraged collapse that eviscerated customer funds. Maybe the politicians will point to their successful healthcare legislation (if it\xe2\x80\x99s not declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.) Thanksgiving reflections are carrying me from criticism of our US officials to contempt, and it feels bad. It is hard to imagine how so many serious social and economic problems could be ignored for the sake of political expediency and election-year posturing. My fellow Americans, when you see your Congressional Representatives, please tell them you will vote for someone else. Tell them you will vote for anyone else who will have the courage to do the right thing for our country. Rick Santelli\xe2\x80\x99s cry to \xe2\x80\x9cStop Spending!\xe2\x80\x9d is absolutely on point. A crippling debt is growing and will soon reach a point of inescapable pain. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t close your eyes and dismiss this bit of Washington noise as beyond your understanding or concern. I promise it is neither. Imagine having minimum credit card payments that are bigger than your monthly income. As you consider what you might do, understand that this is where the US is headed. Please tell Congress to stop spending and to do the right thing. Germany is the strongest member of the European Union. Chancellor Angela Merkel is treading a peril-filled path between her country\xe2\x80\x99s interests and the not-very-different economic interests of the EU. A crack in the foundation appeared this week as Germany\xe2\x80\x99s bond auction failed to attract sufficient buyers. It was the worst bond sale in Germany\xe2\x80\x99s history. The EU is a major economic trading partner for the US, and signs of an impending recession in Europe mean that we are under greater pressure to get our house in order. President Obama appointed this twelve member Super Committee in August and charged it with agreeing on specific ways to significantly reduce our deficit spending. They met privately away from the pressures of the press and public scrutiny \xe2\x80\x93 and they failed. They agreed upon nothing. One side refused to accept tax increases, and the other side refused reductions in funding for entitlement programs. Political expediency trumped doing the right thing. Our economic situation, while recovering on the ground, is building a time-bomb for the not too distant future. Its gravity demands a clear strategy and decisive action that go beyond partisanship, and it has to happen now. President Kennedy told Americans to \xe2\x80\x9cask what you can do for your country.\xe2\x80\x9d Ronald Reagan said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have a special reason for wanting to solve this (economic) problem in a lasting way.

969,"Buy Broken Stocks, Not Broken Companies",Mad Money,23-11-2011,"Buy broken stocks, not broken companies. It\xe2\x80\x99s a longtime Cramer maxim, and a sell-off can be the best opportunity. But how does an investor tell the difference?Usually, broken companies lead the decline. They\xe2\x80\x99re the reason the sell-off is happening in the first place. In 2007, weak real estate, bad loans and mortgages and the bonds that backed them all lead to the credit crisis. So any company related to housing, lending and mortgages was probably broken.More recently, a combination of concerns caused stocks to fall in summer 2011, including the U.S. debt ceiling, S&P's credit rating downgrade and liquidity concerns in Europe. All of these things led to a steep sell-off and increased volatility.Aside of the companies that were at the center of the fray, there\xe2\x80\x99s another group whose profitability is affected even though these companies aren\xe2\x80\x99t directly related to the cause of the sell-off. Cramer offered retail during 2007 as an example because the credit crunch had killed the spending power of the consumer. In 2011, the financials are a good example because these companies remain in the ""cross-hairs of government regulation"" following the Great Recession. Slower gross domestic product growth means slower growth for the sector, he explained.But a company isn\xe2\x80\x99t broken just because the stock price dropped. It\xe2\x80\x99s only when the reason for liking it is gone that a company attains that status. Just look at the other sectors in 2007 that dropped when housing and credit took the market down. Infrastructure, oil and agriculture were all strong industries that took at hit even though they weren\xe2\x80\x99t factors in the decline. This occurred again in summer 2011.The stocks went down because all stocks were going down, Cramer said, but there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a connection to the causes of the sell-off.So when looking for opportunity in a sell-off, he recommended buying stocks in sectors that are independent of what\xe2\x80\x99s ailing the market. A note of caution: Even if you think a bottom is approaching, and the worst performers will become the best, avoid those stocks, Cramer said. Once a company breaks, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to mend itself. And that\xe2\x80\x99s only more true for sectors, which control half of a stock\xe2\x80\x99s movement.Written by Tom Brennan and Drew Sandholm; Edited by Drew SandholmCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

Here's what they said:Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotia Capital, likes the Canadian dollar against the euro. ""The combination of Canada's triple-A status, commodity base, stable government"" and relatively solid economic fundamentals should bolster the loonie, she told me, while the euro against the Canadian dollar ""should face significant headwinds ahead.""

""News from Europe seems more likely to be negative than positive and CAD fundamentals look superior,"" he says. He suggest entering the trade around current levels with a stop near 1.4075, close to Wednesday's high, and a target of 1.38 or lower. Rebecca Patterson, chief markets strategist for J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Institutional, bought the dollar against the Swedish krona recently,\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0and also sold the Australian dollar against the dollar.  ""They have worked great,"" she told me, and while the Aussie trade is near her target, her first idea may still have room to run.Chris Fernandes, vice president and forex adviser at Bank of the West, likes commodity currencies as a longer term play. ""I like the Australian dollar  and the Canadian dollar  - the Australian dollar maybe a little more just because Australia is more closely tied to China and Canada is tied to the U.S.,"" he told me. ""I think commodity prices are going to stay firm."" Paresh Upadhyaya, chief G10 FX strategist for Bank of America Merrill Lynch, also wants to sell the Australian dollar, but he would do so against the Canadian dollar. The Aussie ""is more vulnerable to a global growth slowdown,"" and the Reserve Bank of Australia is starting to cut interest rates while the Bank of Canada is on hold, he told me.

987,Euro Takes Out Key Short-Term Support to Open Fresh Drop,Currency Contest,23-11-2011,"With the Euro unable to take out 1.3420 in the early week, we had warned of a potential corrective rally towards 1.3700 before the selling resumed. However, the correction never really played out and the Euro remains well offered on even the shallowest of rallies to suggest that we could soon see a fresh downside extension to retest the key October lows at 1.3145. Look for a sustained break below 1.3420 on Wednesday to confirm and accelerate declines. Today\xe2\x80\x99s break below 1.3420 is a significant short-term development, as it now opens the door for yet another broad based round of USD buying against all currencies.While the Euro is the most influential in terms of gauging directional bias and overall risk appetite, it will not be the hardest hit now that the 1.3420 level be taken out. Instead, the downside break will expose the higher yielding commodity currencies, which have relatively outperformed in recent years and are now at risk for major liquidation as market participants realize that the global recession even extends to these markets. The Australian Dollar is the strongest candidate for relative underperformance going forward, as we continue to project that a third wave of the recession will spread to China, which ultimately will weigh heavily on the correlated Australian economy. China\xe2\x80\x99s latest HSBC flash PMIs came in below the critical 50 boom/bust level, and this in conjunction with a generally downbeat market environment should continue to weigh on the Australian Dollar going forward, even against the Euro. We have been very short Aussie over the past several weeks, both against the USD, where we are short from 1.0550, and against the Euro, where we are long EUR/AUD from 1.3300. While most have understood the logic behind the short AUD/USD trade, many had questioned the motivation for a long EUR/AUD position with things so bad in the Eurozone. As we explained back then, and as appears to be now materializing, the fact that we still see a third wave of the global recession spreading towards Australia, and the fact that we perceived the worst case scenario to already be priced into the Eurozone, was the primary driver for this strategy. While we have booked some profit on both our short AUD/USD position and long EUR/AUD position, we continue to project major Aussie weakness against both of these currencies over the coming weeks and months.Other headlines seen negatively influencing risk sentiment on Wednesday have been chatter of a Dexia bailout and comments from Pimco\xe2\x80\x99s El Erian that US economic conditions are \xe2\x80\x9cterrifying.\xe2\x80\x9d In the European session, the as expected 9-0 unanimous policy and asset purchase decision disclosed in the Bank of England Minutes, failed to influence price action. Meanwhile, Eurozone PMIs were on the whole mixed, with manufacturing consistently weaker, while services were better. Eurozone industrial new orders were however disastrous and did not doing anything to help the single currency\xe2\x80\x99s cause. To add more fuel to the fire, the German bond auction was very poorly received and said to have been the catalyst to trigger the breakdown below 1.3420.Moving on, Wednesday will be the last full day of trade for the week, with the US markets lightening up significantly for the Thanksgiving Day holiday. Markets are always unpredictable in these times of lightened volatility, so the best place to be could very well be on the sidelines until normal market conditions resume next week.Technically, we continue to defer to the EUR/USD monthly chart, which has been extremely useful this year. The market looks like it has been in a steady downtrend since positing record highs in 2008, and is now in the process of a carving out the next major lower top below 1.5000 ahead of a retest of some multi-month range lows in the lower 1.2000\xe2\x80\x99s. Once the lower 1.2000\xe2\x80\x99s are tested, it is entirely possible that we see further acceleration towards parity, but at this point, it is way too premature to make such calls and we will have to step back an reassess when the market gets down to our lower 1.2000 area objective.Looking ahead, the calendar is quite busy in North America, with durable goods, personal spending, personal consumption, personal income, initial jobless claims, and Michigan confidence all due. On the official circuit, Bank of Canada\xe2\x80\x99s Carney is slated to speak. US equity futures and oil prices are tracking a good deal lower on the day, while gold has reversed early gains and is also offered.",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/23/euro-takes-out-key-shortterm-support-to-open-fresh-drop.html
988,Think Tank to Euro Zone: Get It Together,Money in Motion,23-11-2011,"German bonds aren't selling, yields on Spanish and Italian bonds are squeezing, and the euro is showing the strain. Good thing someone's dispensing tough love.\xc2\xa0The calls are increasing for the European Central Bank to wade into the European debt crisis, but officials are resisting. So are factions in various countries - like, say, Germany, and the euro  has been falling. In a new policy brief, Bruegel, the European think tank, says enough is enough: ""The Economic and Monetary Union architecture must be strengthened by taking steps towards a fiscal union that involves both a political authority (a euro-area 'finance minister') and fiscal resources to prevent, manage and resolve crises."" And they are calling on euro zone leaders to ""adopt before the end of 2011 a Declaration outlining the contours"" of these steps. Bruegel identifies three key weakness in the current system: the idea that national policymaking can jeopardize monetary union functioning, the lack of a crisis management system, and inadequate banking supervision and regulation. The analysts argue that a new system should address all these problems. Possible solutions include a euro-area finance ministry that could help countries facing liquidity problems, better plans to deal with countries that are actually insolvent, and euro area banking oversight. Euro-area leaders have asked the Euro-Summit President to offer proposals for some policy changes, but Bruegel argues that much more is needed. And for starters, they say, ""The ECB will have to play a significant role to back-stop the financial system and the sovereign bond market.""Food for thought.

998,Tamminen: Give Thanks for Regulations,The Guest Blog,23-11-2011,"In the Broadway hit musical,""Book of Mormon,"" a woman from Uganda envisions paradise as a place where warlords are benevolent and the Red Cross hands out as much flour as you can eat. In other words, the things that inspire hope and gratitude in any part of the world are in the eye of the beholder.In this season of Thanksgiving in the U.S., I am grateful for clean air, water, and a productive landscape. Oh sure, we still suffer from too much pollution and degradation of these shared resources, but compared to Uganda or many other parts of the globe, we live in paradise. And what provides our comparative advantage in this regard? In a word, regulations. Environmental laws and regulations are not the evil that some politicians would have you believe. They are the hallmarks of civilization that give us a better quality of life and the ability to conduct business on a level playing field in ways that other countries can only dream about.Take for instance our air quality laws. The Obama administration was wrong to delay implementation of smog-busting rules, especially in the misplaced hopes that conservative opponents would see this as an olive branch and somehow begin to compromise on other tough issues. Our air quality regulations, many of which were first tested in my state of California and proven effective both for public health and the economy, differentiate us from Beijing or Delhi, where a lack of such rules means you are inhaling the equivalent amount of toxins of two packs of cigarettes a day \xe2\x80\x94 just by breathing the air. By comparison, a study released last March by the USEPA documents about $2 trillion in benefits by 2020 from our air quality laws, if we actually implement them all, including prevention of about 160,000 deaths, 200,000 cases of heart disease, and over twenty two million missed school and work days \xe2\x80\x94 each year (note to Republican opponents of these regulations: the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act were signed into law by President George H.W. Bush with support from both parties). Let's also consider water quality regulations. Polluted stormwater runoff impacts the US economy with massive dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico that decimate commercial fisheries. Such unchecked pollution also seeps into groundwater, forcing cities to spend millions on treatment systems. Although the Clean Water Actregulates stormwater pollution and has made great strides towards cleaning up toxic runoff from sources such as agricultural runoff, industrial sites, and roadways, politics have prevented state and federal regulators from finishing the job.

If consumers are looking for Black Friday deals, chances are, they'll look where they spend a ton of time: Facebook. This year more than ever Facebook is a key tool for retailers to connect with shoppers. And this year big brands aren't just trying to get fans to buy, they're trying to spread their message to fans *friends* -- to leverage the site for the power of its networks. Facebook's VP of US sales, Tom Arrix, told me the company believes businesses are simply ""better in a more social and connected world."" He meets with Fortune 500 brands to convince them brands that *aren't* on Facebook are leaving money on the table. This year brands are using the site not just to promote black Friday deals and special hours, but to help people shop for their friends. Wal-Mart has pages for every one of its 4,400 US stores and recently uploaded maps with info on where to find different deals. JC Penney  wants to help shoppers select gifts, with a Facebook guessing game that allows users to share their ""wish lists"" and learn about friends' lists. eBay also is using Facebook for 'wish lists,' and is going one step further -- allowing gifters to organize groups to chip in for bigger gifts on those lists.

1021,Euro Still at Risk for Deeper Setbacks Over Coming Weeks,Currency Contest,25-11-2011,"Currencies continue with their downward trajectory against the US Dollar into the final day of the week, and it appears that many of the major currencies are now fated to retest their key October lows against the Greenback. The latest bout of risk liquidation has been brought on by a number of factors including Germany Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s ruling out prospects for jointly issued Eurobonds and firm opposition to the idea of the ECB being a lender of last resort, along with Fitch\xe2\x80\x99s downgrade of Portugal to junk status, and record-wide Italian bond spreads. Throw in some dovish comments from BOE Miles in reaction to the global slowdown and the Eurozone crisis, and some concerning comments relating to the Japanese economy, and the overall picture is not looking good for risk.However, there has been one development over the past several hours which perhaps has slipped under the radar of many market participants who have been distracted with Thanksgiving holidays or the Merkel/Sarkozy/Monti mini summit. The FT has released\xc2\xa0 an article reporting that the Dutch have endorsed the idea of the ECB being a lender of last resort. This could provide some welcome support for the downtrodden Euro, with the Dutch endorsement coming as a surprise given their staunch opposition to this idea (perhaps more aggressive opposition than even Germany) up until this point. While Germany\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of the idea is certainly more important, this gesture could start to put more pressure on the Germans to finally accept the ECB as a lender of last resort.Still, the Euro remains in trouble on a broader scale and we expect to see any rallies well capped. Technically, we continue to defer to the EUR/USD monthly chart, which has been extremely useful this year. The market looks like it has been in a steady downtrend since positing record highs in 2008, and is now in the process of a carving out the next major lower top below 1.5000 ahead of a retest of some multi-month range lows in the lower 1.2000\xe2\x80\x99s. Once the lower 1.2000\xe2\x80\x99s are tested, it is entirely possible that we see further acceleration towards parity, but at this point, it is way too premature to make such calls and we will have to step back an reassess when the market gets down to our lower 1.2000 area objective.Looking ahead, markets should be quiet for the remainder of the day, with trade expected to lighten significantly into the holiday US trade.

With the short session and light volume on Friday, trader Mike Murphy said \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll get the real tell on Monday.\xe2\x80\x9d And with the market trading so technically, he and the other Fast Money pros suggested keeping an eye on 1155. That\xe2\x80\x99s a key Fibonacci level, specifically, it\xe2\x80\x99s the 50% retracement of the entire up-leg from the Oct 4 low of 1068 to the Oct 27 high of 1289.25.We know that's confusing but in a nutshell it means how the S&P behaves at 1155 will be a \xe2\x80\x98tell\xe2\x80\x99 for pros who watch technicals. (It's worth noting, our pros made the comment on Wednesday and on Friday the S&P closed within a few points of 1155.)Therefore, on Monday, if the market bounces higher, that would be considered a bullish sign because it would signal that the key level of 1155 did, infact hold. By contrast if the S&P goes much lower it would be considered bearish because the key level failed.All week long the Fast Money pros have discussed their bias - both higher or lower. Here\xe2\x80\x99s what was said. Trader Joe Terranova thought the more likely scenario was a bounce. \xe2\x80\x9dBlack Friday and Cyber Monday should be catalysts,\xe2\x80\x9d he said back on Tuesday November 22nd. And he may be right. Early signs pointed to bigger crowds at the nation's malls and stores as shoppers flooded retailers like Target and Macy's, kicking off the holiday shopping season with a bang.Pete Najarian was also bullish. On Monday he said, ""We're not seeing the Vix  explode above 40. I'd expect more volatility if we were on the brink of a major sell-off.""Amid a pullback, Najarian was a strategic buyer. ""Look at rails that have been beaten down \xe2\x80\x93 CNI  under $75 and Mosaic in the ag space \xe2\x80\x93 are attractive. Also big Pharma.

1058,Cyber Monday May Set Record as US Goes on Buying Binge,Consumer Nation,28-11-2011,"Take door-buster specials, add early opening hours, and mix in a good measure of pent-up demand and you have a recipe for a strong start to the holiday shopping season.And retailers liked it so much, expect to see a version of it \xe2\x80\x94 albeit smaller \xe2\x80\x94 today, as a record number of shoppers are expected to go online to snag Cyber Monday deals, which at some retailers, began Sunday night. Black Friday sales are estimated to have risen 6.6 percent from the same time last year, according to ShopperTrak, a Chicago-based company that tracks mall traffic. That estimated $11.4 billion in retail purchases represents the biggest dollar amount ever spent on that day.The National Retail Federation estimates 226 million shoppers visited stores and websites over the Black Friday weekend, up from 212 million last year. The survey, which interviewed more than 3,800 adults, reports that the average holiday shoppers spent $398.62 over the Thanksgiving weekend, up from $365.34 last year. Conducted by BIGResearch, the study also found that online spending was significant, with shoppers shelling out an average of $150.53 on the web, or 37.8 percent of their total weekend outlay. And the spending binge wasn\xe2\x80\x99t isolated to just Friday. The shopping started Thursday, as record number of consumers purchased items on their smartphones and tablets, presumably at the Thanksgiving dinner table, or headed out to early openings at stores such as Toys \xe2\x80\x98R Us and Wal-Mart Stores , which didn\xe2\x80\x99t even wait until midnight Friday to begin their Black Friday deals. The shopping should continue today, as record numbers of shoppers are expected to go online seek Cyber Monday deals. Deal Gap Closing Cyber Mondayhas become a more significant each year. Retailers embraced it and are offering bigger and bigger discounts online \xe2\x80\x94 and more and more shoppers are coming for them. That is what is what makes the event, which initially began as marketing gimmick to promote online shopping, more important each year.

1060,Why Facebook Won't Challenge Google in Search,Behind the Money,27-11-2011,"Facebook is not planning to get into the search business, according to a top technology analyst who spoke with management at the social network.\xe2\x80\x9cBased on discussions with management over the year, we believe Facebook has no intention of getting into the search business,\xe2\x80\x9d said Citigroup\xe2\x80\x99s Mark Mahaney, the top-ranked technology analyst according to Institutional Investor magazine. \xe2\x80\x9cWe also believe it has seen limited impact from the integration of social signals into overall search results, based on its integration with Bing to date.\xe2\x80\x9dMicrosoft\xe2\x80\x99s  Bing and Facebook enhanced their partnership about a year ago as the search engine began integrating the \xe2\x80\x9clikes\xe2\x80\x9d of one\xe2\x80\x99s friends in an effort to get results based more on social connections.\xe2\x80\x9cThis could be a function of the limits of Bing\xe2\x80\x99s Search engine (with disappointing Yahoo -Bing search experience also highlighting these limits) or it could be a function of the inherently limited role that social signals can play within search,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Mahaney in the note to clients Sunday. \xe2\x80\x9cEither way, there\xe2\x80\x99s less risk to Google here.\xe2\x80\x9dSubsequently, the analyst upgraded Google shares to \xe2\x80\x9cbuy\xe2\x80\x9d because of the diminished Facebook threat, as well as an expected flattening of operating expenses and a compelling valuation. Google is trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 12, below the 25 percent and 22 percent EPS growth rates Mahaney is expecting in 2011 and 2012 for the company respectively.Mahaney downgraded Google in April because of concerns about decreasing margins and the EU and Department of Justice's anti-trust investigations. His $680 price target implies a 21 percent return for the shares.To be sure, the analyst still expects Facebook to be a formidable competitor for Google in the display advertising area. The biggest share of people\xe2\x80\x99s time spent online is on their Facebook profile, creating a big opportunity for the still-private social network in display advertising.For the best market insight, catch 'Fast Money' each night at 5pm ET, and the \xe2\x80\x98Halftime Report\xe2\x80\x99 each afternoon at 12:00 ET on CNBC.

1064,Is Stock Surge Early Sign of Santa Claus Rally?,Fast Money,28-11-2011,"Foodies may still be savoring Thanksgiving leftovers, but market pros have been squarely focused on Christmas and the potential of a Santa Claus Rally.Although purists will argue the term Santa Claus rally should be limited to the stock market gains that can occur between Christmas and New Year\xe2\x80\x99s day, the Fast Money gang and many other pros take a broader view.They use the term Santa Claus rally to describe a march higher across the entire month of December, with investor sentiment buoyed by intangible catalysts, such as the good cheer that prevails during the season.And investors can\xe2\x80\x99t help but wonder if Monday\xe2\x80\x99s market action was a sign that a 2011 Santa Claus rally was about to get underway.By all accounts the stock market gains were impressive. The Dow surged by triple digits and all 10 sectors of the S&P closed sharply higher.But that\xe2\x80\x99s not to say the Grinch didn't have his eye on this market too. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s been no confirmation from the bond market,\xe2\x80\x9d reminds the skeptical Guy Adami. In other words, if investor appetite for riskier assets such as stocks was increasing, yields in Treasurys should also start to climb as money rotates out of the bond market. And that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen. How should you interpret Monday\xe2\x80\x99s action? Should you position for a big end of year rally? Or should you take profits while you still can?Trader Tim Seymour is relatively hopeful. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we\xe2\x80\x99re at the beginning of an\xc2\xa0 allocation,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. Historically the last couple days of November into the first week of December is a time when capital is re-allocated into stocks. And he says fundamentals could support market gains. Late reports suggested that Europe is getting more aggressive in their attempts to contain the overseas financial crisis.Trader Joe Terranova is cautiously bullish but adds that he\xe2\x80\x99s needs confirmation before he can hit the buy button.

1071,Black Friday a Win But are Retailers Giving Away the Farm?,The Guest Blog,27-11-2011,"The results are in. According to Shopper Trak, sales increased 6.6% on Black Friday. Consumers were inspired by record breaking discounts and store openings as early as 9 p.m. on Turkey Day. That was enough to get the average American to skip dessert, push back from the dinner table and hit the stores in search of savings.\xc2\xa0 For all the negative press about early openings eating into family time and sad-faced employees who had to show up early and therefore did not have much of a holiday, the early rush was a success. Employees did receive over-time and consumers welcomed the opportunity to take advantage of discounts to self-gift, fill stockings and maybe work off a little turkey and pumpkin pie. Apparently a win-win situation for all involved.In the name of research I recruited family members and hit a local Wal-Mart at 10 p.m. Thursday. I have to give kudos to Wal-Mart. Yes there were a few incidents (the pepper spray lady in California trying to protect her focus on cheap games) but Wal-Mart did everything in its power to promote a safe, orderly Black Friday (if there is such a thing). Consumers rushed the doors and headed for the top promotions: Xbox, TVs, games, toys and apparel. While there was plenty of potential for being run-over, Wal-Mart had a plan this year unlike many retailers.First, a map of promotions. A map and balloons indicated where to line up for specific category discounts and numbers were handed out for limited quantities. By the time 10.15 had rolled around you were out of luck. The early birds got the worm. While I could have received a \xe2\x80\x9cticket\xe2\x80\x9d for the Emerson TV special at 10 p.m., I was told I would have to stand there for 2 hours.

The Chevy Volt, the halo car that is supposed to paint GM in a better light and convince America GM has changed, is the subject of a federal investigation into whether it is safe or not. For GM executives, the implications of the investigation go well beyond whether or not it will hurt, or potentially devastate, sales of Chevy Volt. No, the bigger issue is whether the vehicle, literally and figuratively, that GM has staked its reputation on, is going to become an embarrassing punch line for corporate failure? This is why the head of GM North America, Mark Reuss, and the head of GM Global Product Development, Mary Barra, are holding a conference call to answer questions about the Chevy Volt. It would be quaint to think GM is getting out in front of this story. The fact is, once the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration officially launched a defect investigation, GM found itself playing catch up.

""It's an alphabet soup,"" says Win Thin, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. Meanwhile, of course, the headlines announcing agreements or nonagreements on debt plans will continue. Under these circumstances, it's not so easy to keep a trading plan in mind. According to Win, a simple idea is best. ""If nothing concrete comes out on Wednesday, I think the euro  goes back down,"" he told me. ""If we go back to business as usual, I think people will go back to shorting the euro and stocks.""What about the news today that European leaders may be negotiating a new pact? ""We're keeping an eye out - but how many times have you heard these vague promises come out of Europe and nothing happens?"" he says. In the meantime, bond yields in the eurozone overall - even including Germany - have spiked sharply higher than those in the other G10 countries, according to an analysis by Citigroup. And the OECD and Moody's are both warning that a solution to the debt crisis is urgently needed.

We have speculative names like Wynn , Salesforce.com , and Priceline.com  surging. And yet one group seemingly tailor-made for risk on rallies is suspiciously absent from today's action: social internet stocks. Shares of LinkedIn and Groupon are both sharply lower, but it's LinkedIn shares that are attracting the interest of options traders. With a hour to go in trading, LinkedIn puts are 60% more active than calls, with just over 13,000 puts trading hands. There appears little catalyst for the sell-off, but some investors point to a Forbes articlesuggesting a $43 price target as a possible culprit.

1100,Post-Holiday Consolidation Provides Markets with Welcome Relief,Currency Contest,28-11-2011,"The markets will get back to fuller trade on Monday, with the US returning from the Thanksgiving holiday and set to digest this latest round of price action which has seen accelerated risk liquidation. While we continue to project broad based US Dollar strength, we would also not rule out the possibility for some more healthy corrective selling in the buck in the early week. Generally, it is not unusual to see profit taking and market retracements following the absence of a key session from the markets. Still, the key level to watch is the 1.3145 October low in EUR/USD, with a break of the level to officially negate the USD bearish price action seen in the month of October, and potentially open the next major downside extension into the 1.2000\xe2\x80\x99s. Fresh offers are seen in the Euro into the 1.3450-1.3500 area.Despite the price action today, headlines over the weekend have not been Euro and currency supportive, and while there was some relief buying seen on rumors of an IMF Eur600B loan to Italy, these rumors were later denied. An article in a German publication said that the EFSF would not be able to leverage up to EUR1T, while market participants also remained focused on the ever widening Italian and peripheral Eurozone bond spreads. Moody\xe2\x80\x99s then came out and said that the rising severity of the Eurozone crisis threatened all EU sovereign debt ratings and that the probability for multiple defaults by Euro area countries was no longer negligible. Finally, news that ICAP was preparing its electronic trading systems for a potential exit by Greece from the Eurozone and a return to the Drachma, did not help matters. Outside of what can only be described as some profit taking and a potential short squeeze, the only other logical plausible explanation for the currency, equity and commodity strength were talk of SMP activity and news of a larger China investment into the IMF.Looking ahead, the economic calendar for Monday is rather light, with mostly secondary data due. The only key release in North American trade comes in the form of US new home sales. Still, there are broader forces at play and we suspect that the larger global macro themes and developments will ultimately be what drive price action for the remainder of the day. US equity futures and commodities prices are extremely well bid as mentioned, but we continue to question the strength and will be looking to sell into these rallies.

1101,"Stock Market Surge, Just a Snap Back Rally, Says Pro Trader",Halftime Report,28-11-2011,"On Monday investors were trying to determine if the market had finally put the worst behind it, with the Dow surging by triple digits, and all but two of the stocks in the S&P 500 trading in positive territory around lunchtime.Optimism was sparked by new efforts on several fronts to ease Europe's debt crisis. Specifically, published reports suggested thata radical proposal was gaining momentum; one in which countries that use the euro would cede control of a big chunk of their budgets to a central authority.And another report said the International Monetary Fund was preparing a rescue plan for Italy worth up to 600 billion euros. (The IMF later denied the report. )Investors interpreted the flurry of headlines as new signs that stability was returning to Europe. How should you position now?Strategy Session with the Fast Money traders\xe2\x80\x9dThis is just a snap back rally,\xe2\x80\x9d says a skeptical Stephen Weiss. ""I'm not buying.""

The bottom line here is that Europe is still without a real solution.\xe2\x80\x9dTrader Pete Najarian agrees that the trade is take profits. He points to the action in the Vix  which didn\xe2\x80\x99t recede to the degree he\xe2\x80\x99d expect, if the market was feeling relief. \xe2\x80\x9cWith the Vix around 32 there\xe2\x80\x99s still plenty of uncertainty.\xe2\x80\x9dTrader Steve Grasso suggests watching 1205 as the next key technical level. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the 50-day,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, and how the market behaves at that level should be informing. ""Focus on that and play accordingly.""However, on a modestly bullish note he points out that on Friday the S&P closed at a key technical level, 1155 and that level held. (1155 is a key Fibonacci level -\xc2\xa0 the 50% retracement of the entire up-leg from the Oct 4 low of 1068 to the Oct 27 high of 1289.25.)If nothing more, holding 1155 suggests the market has a short-term bottom.Jon Najarian is more bullish. Though he agrees it\xe2\x80\x99s always prudent to take profits he says, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t just dismiss the strength in retail \xe2\x80\x93 that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t expected.\xe2\x80\x9d______________________________________________________Got something to to say?

1105,How to Trade on the Euro's Updraft,Money in Motion,28-11-2011,"The euro got a bit of a lift on talk of a new grand plan, but this strategist says it's an opportunity to sell the single currency against another.Not a bad way to kick off a new week, with the euro\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0riding higher on talk of fresh ideas from euro zone leaders on the debt crisis. Unfortunately, the good times won't be here for long, says Valentin Marinov, a currency strategist at Citigroup.For starters, Marinov says, the euro zone leaders seem to be focused on a new plan for the strongest countries in the euro zone - and that would leave Greece, Italy and others out in the cold. ""Chances are also that the push for EU treaty changes needed for the creation of broader fiscal union could face some stiff opposition by various euro zone and EU countries,"" he says. ""In turn, this could mean that ECB support for the beleaguered euro zone bond markets may not be as forthcoming as investors are hoping."" Marinov is much more bullish on the Canadian dollar,  since Canada has huge trading exposure to theU.S., which is exhibiting resilience ""despite the intensifying headwinds out of the euro zone."" If commodity prices rise as a result of global growth, that would help the loonie as well, he says. Canada also scored well on the CitiFX Scorecard, which measures economic surprises and other factors. You got it: Marinov wants to sell the euro against the Canadian dollar.

1114,"Forget Economists, Chris Rock Knows Best",Currency Contest,29-11-2011,"Many of you are wondering why risk correlated assets continue to rally so aggressively over the past few sessions and why the USD has come back under pressure. You are not alone \xe2\x80\x93 I usually avoid using \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d in my analysis and prefer sticking to the royal \xe2\x80\x9cwe,\xe2\x80\x9d but this time I am so perplexed with the price action that I need to use \xe2\x80\x9cI.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus far, headlines out of the Eurozone have been far from comforting, and the latest warnings from the traditionally conservative OECD on the region should send additional chills down investors\xe2\x80\x99 spines.The OECD is an institution that is not known for deviating too far away from consensus. Trader should pay attention to its comments that the Eurozone debt crisis has become the biggest threat to the global economy, and that a break up can not be ruled out. The institution goes on to say that \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The ECB should buy bonds, and set a limit to yields or a floor to bond value, so that markets know there's a counter party ready to trade at that level.\xe2\x80\x99 In order to stop the contagion, policy makers need to secure \xe2\x80\x98credible and substantial increases\xe2\x80\x99 in the capacity of the European Financial Stability Fund, the euro zone's bailout vehicle, together with a greater use of the ECB's balance sheet. \xe2\x80\x98The present situation is worse than in 2009.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9dThrow in the ongoing threat of downgrade from rating agencies, continued widening of Eurozone bond spreads to record levels, and a banking system that looks like it is on the verge of collapse, and we find it very difficult to rationalize a market that is content to buy back into risk correlated assets. We would venture to say that we are as equally perplexed with the latest rally in risk correlated markets as we are with the idea that clients at MF Global are not able to recover their highly protected and segregated funds. While the MF Global situation is not Eurozone centric, it should not be overlooked.And yet, risk correlated assets are well bid over the past few sessions and market participants are seemingly content on either booking profits on short risk positions, or dare I say actually buying back into risk. We have a hard time accepting the latter proposal and therefore would simply classify this latest price action as nothing more than some corrective relief to fill the gap from the previous week\xe2\x80\x99s thin holiday trade before eventually resuming the more justified underlying risk off trend. With this in mind, we continue to project broad based weakness in all risk correlated assets, with the US Dollar as the primary beneficiary of these flows. There is simply no other currency that can handle risk liquidation flows as well as the US Dollar, and we even project significant weakness in the Yen over the medium and longer-term. Our view on the Yen is far from conventional, but we are calling for a breakdown in familiar correlations to the point that we could actually see then Yen underperform across the board in a risk off market environment. This would be counterintuitive and imply that serious bouts of risk liquidation going forward would see the Yen crosses moving higher rather than lower, and this is exactly what we are projecting. In our humble opinion (my humble opinion), I see a situation where Japan no longer can absorb the appreciation in the Yen on safe-haven flows and external non-Japan specific fundamentals, and will look to more aggressively intervene on behalf of its currency to prevent additional appreciation. This should play out in an even stronger way than had been seen with the Swiss Franc several weeks back, and as such, one of our favorite trades heading into 2012 is to look to build short Yen positions.To be safe, we think the best strategy over the coming months is to play the long USD/JPY trade rather than long other Yen crosses, as we see less downside risk in this play. While it is also true that there could be less upside potential here, we still think there is plenty of upside that the trade is worth serious consideration. Should we be wrong in our view and additional risk liquidation continues to benefit the Yen, the USD will also likely benefit equally if not more going forward on risk liquidation flows, so our downside in this situation should be limited. If we are wrong on the other side and market somehow turn around sharply and we see a resurgence in risk appetite, then we will be happily wrong, as the development will likely open the door for a more aggressive selling in the Yen on a move back into risk correlated assets. Finally, while the long USD/JPY position does not offer anything exciting in terms of yield, it is still classified as a carry trade (albeit a baby carry) which means that holding the position on a daily basis earns interest on the favorable yield differential.At the end of the day, it seems as though market participants are finding comfort in the fact that governments are coming up with solutions to deal with the crisis and are rewarding these efforts by buying back into risk. But the logic makes no sense to us, and in our opinion, the fact that there needs to be such an aggressive response by governments to intervene is a clear sign that things are not good. We are reminded of a bit performed by comedian Chris Rock\xc2\xa0 - the comedian talks of a parent who proudly announces to everyone \xe2\x80\x9cI take care of my kids.\xe2\x80\x9d Rock\xe2\x80\x99s response to this type of obnoxious remark is \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to take care of your kids you [insert profanity]!\xc2\xa0 What do you want\xe2\x80\xa6 a cookie??\xe2\x80\x9d The same holds true in our opinion with the crisis. Why should we reward governments for coming up with resolutions to a crisis that they are supposed come up with? In fairness, we are less critical of the governments in this situation and more taken with the reaction of markets which applaud their government for taking action that is needed. Buying back into risk therefore makes absolutely no sense to us at this point and we continue to project a resumption of pressure on these assets and broad based flow of funds into the safe haven US Dollar.NEW TRADE: For today, our strategy has triggered a new trade in AUD/USD. While we are already short from several weeks back at 1.0550 (booked profit on half at 1.0150), we have decided to build back into the position following the latest surge beyond parity. Overall, we see this market in the process of carving a major longer-term top, with any rallies viewed as formidable sell opportunities in anticipation of a bearish resumption and eventual break back below the critical October lows at 0.9385. Technically, the market looks exhausted intraday after the hourly RSI boomed towards 80 and the daily ATR (Average True Range) was well exceeded. Ideally, risks for additional upside on Tuesday are limited, and the market should start to pullback. We will look for this intraday pullback to build into something more significant, with a break back below 0.9860 to confirm and accelerate. We will only exit the short position should the market ever put in a daily close above 1.0250 (5pm New York). We also recommend that the position be un-leveraged. Our risk on this specific\xc2\xa0 trade is less than 2% of total equity.",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/29/forget-economists-chris-rock-knows-best.html

1117,Cramer: Start Selling Into This Rally,Mad Money,28-11-2011,"Stocks ended sharply higher Monday as optimism grew that European leaders would come up with a new planto resolve the region\xe2\x80\x99s debt crisis and following a strong Black Friday sales numbers. But despite that \xe2\x80\x9cspectacular\xe2\x80\x9d market action, \xe2\x80\x9cMad Money\xe2\x80\x9d host Jim Cramerurged homegamers to curb their enthusiasm. The reason is one he\xe2\x80\x99s been preaching about for months\xe2\x80\x94Europe. \xe2\x80\x9cI'm calling this DEFCON three, two stages away from a financial collapse so huge it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get your mind around,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Simply put, the troubled countries in Europe have borrowed too much and can\xe2\x80\x99t pay their bills. That leaves the banks stuck with the credit risk, in the form of bonds the countries owe, and the countries can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to pay them back. Right now, these countries are hoping either the rich countries pool their resources to buy these bonds or that they\xe2\x80\x99ll support the banks. Another possible option is a bridge loan from entities like the IMF.What happens if the troubled countries can't pay? They're so huge that they could pull down most of the European banks, Cramer said.And if you think it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t affect the U.S. you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong, Cramer said. Not only is Europe a huge market for U.S. goods, but struggling European banks owe billions of dollars to big American banks. But because the banks do not have to disclose what they insured or lent, we have no idea which banks may have lent enough money to \xe2\x80\x9csink\xe2\x80\x9d them.The bottom line\xe2\x80\x94it's credit that's ailing the world, he said. Without it, no one can pay their bills. That's why he thinks it's time to sell companies that need credit, was well as high-flyers with little or no dividends. \xe2\x80\x9cCredit is so important that anyone who can\xe2\x80\x99t get it will be overwhelmed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich is why you need to start selling into this rally, until we get some assurances that some huge entity like the European Central Bank is willing to print money to save the situation, at least until next Christmas, when we can only hope that things get better than this one.\xe2\x80\x9dCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

1119,Blog: The Big Bazooka 2 Is Too Late and Too Small,The Guest Blog,29-11-2011,"Yesterday, Moody\xe2\x80\x99s, the US ratings agency, warned that the rapidly escalating Eurozone crisis is threatening the standing of all the region\xe2\x80\x99s governments as their ability to raise capital in the markets is increasingly questioned. The OECD warned that as the euro crisis would infect the core European countries, it would \xe2\x80\x9cmassively escalate economic disruption.\xe2\x80\x9d However, even the warnings are coming months too late. The big bazooka 2, Eurobonds, and the enhanced powers of the European Central Bank are all partial solutions \xe2\x80\x93too little too late. Bailing Out \xe2\x80\x9cToo Big To Fail\xe2\x80\x9d Eurozone Economies In the past, the Eurozone problems were resolvable because the peripheral countries \xe2\x80\x93 Greece, Ireland, and Portugal \xe2\x80\x93 each represented less than 3 percent of the Eurozone economy. However, if Italy or Spain fail to raise money at reasonable interest rates, how could these \xe2\x80\x9ctoo big to fail\xe2\x80\x9d economies be saved? As in the case of the small euro countries, bailing out the two would require covering their public financing requirements for three years. The associated loans would amount to about $2.1 trillion. If the IMF were to fund one-third of the total, as it did in the case of the small peripheral countries, its share would amount to about $700 billion, almost twice the current new lending capacity. In turn, the Eurozone countries would have to raise $1.4 trillion, which exceeds the available capacity of the current rescue fund by over $1 trillion. Even if the bailout would be possible, any sudden stop of financing to Italy and Spain would have a recessionary spillover effect on the rest of Europe, the United States, and the BRICs. Big Bazooka 2 The OECD call for \xe2\x80\x9ccredible and large enough firepower\xe2\x80\x9d in the Eurozone was followed by the extraordinary appeal by the Polish foreign minister Dadoslaw Sikorski to save the Eurozone and the broader European Union from \xe2\x80\x9ca crisis of apocalyptic proportions.\xe2\x80\x9d Simply put, the idea of the Big Bazooka 2 is that the Eurozone leaders would garner another large rescue package, which would comprise funds from the IMF, the Eurozone and the ECB. From the German perspective, such efforts are ridden by moral hazards because the net effect would mean a disincentive to structural reforms and effective austerity programs. Further, huge sums of money would again have to come from Germany where growth is now slowing. To deter such an outcome, Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy have sought to pave way for a fiscal union, but without Italy or Spain \xe2\x80\x93 that is, a de facto layered Eurozone. Print Money, Be Happy? President Obama has urged bolder, quicker and more decisive action in the Eurozone, or what the Europeans call the American way: Print Money. The ECB could assume the role of the Eurozone\xe2\x80\x99s lender of last resort. After all, it has tools to offer a bridge to illiquid individual financial institutions and sovereigns, including emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) and the securities markets program (SMP). Unlike the Fed, however, the official mandate of the ECB is to focus on price stability, not employment. Mario Draghi, the new ECB chief, has been willing to cut rates, but is reluctant to go further, without Germany\xe2\x80\x99s support. Of course, the contagion prospects in the Eurozone\xe2\x80\x99s periphery and now in its core is shifting increasing pressure on the ECB to expand its balance sheet more aggressively. But it would be na\xc3\xafve to expect that there will be supply just because there is demand. The sheer size of exposed countries\xe2\x80\x99 financing needs, along with moral hazard concerns in creditor countries, increase the likelihood of an IMF-co-sponsored international crisis response, with Eurozone countries assuming the first loss risk. Besides, the option of printing money is no option to Germany and certain other creditors who fear a d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu with hyper-inflation. Eurobonds, anybody? After Brussels\xe2\x80\x99 technocrats had denied the need for euro bonds for months, they are now trying to push them under the name of \xe2\x80\x9cstability bonds.\xe2\x80\x9d The idea is to transfer a share of national debt issuance, say 40-60% of GDP , to the Eurozone, while the remainder remains at the national level, subject to idiosyncratic market and credit risk. Over time, a liquid Eurobond market could augment that of the U.S. Treasuries. The bad news is that the realization of the Eurobond market is like an ambivalent love story: it takes time. In the short-term, an important drawback is that the stability bonds mean potentially higher borrowing costs for creditor countries, which is why Chancellor Angela Merkel rejected the option quickly. The wider the gap between fiscally sound and struggling economies, the more difficult it is to reconcile the interests of these two sets of Eurozone countries. In the long run, however, the creditors could be persuaded to join in, given sufficient conditions and fiscal guarantees at national level. But as Keynes once said, in the long run we\xe2\x80\x99re all dead. So what\xe2\x80\x99s left? Lehman Risk Multiplied Three years ago, the Eurozone economies were still in better shape. Today, unemployment rates are very high. Monetary policies have been largely exhausted. Stimulus packages and recovery measures have dissipated. Old leaders have been discredited. Governments have been voted in and out. In the United States, the \xe2\x80\x9cLehman episode\xe2\x80\x9d took months; in the Eurozone, it could require years. Now the stakes are higher, and more global. In the U.S., the subprime mortgage market peaked at $1-$1.5 trillion, whereas the outstanding debt of the peripheral Europe amounts to $4.6 trillion. The Eurozone\xe2\x80\x99s systemic economic problems require comprehensive solutions, which lack political support. Meanwhile, time is about to run out.

And one of those on his wish list is Tractor Supply , the largest chain of farm and ranch stores in the country. Cramer likes TSCO because it\xe2\x80\x99s plugged into the domestic consumer economy and the American consumer is healthy and getting stronger, as evidenced by Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s better-than expected consumer confidence number.The retailer caters to ranching and farming hobbyists and is a \xe2\x80\x9cterrific niche,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t suffer from online competition and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t face much competition from big box retailers or pet supply stores. The stores are located mostly in rural areas or outer-ring suburbs, places that Lowe\xe2\x80\x99s  and Home Depot tend to avoid. Additionally, Tractor Supply\xe2\x80\x99s core demographic\xe2\x80\x94hobby farmers\xe2\x80\x94are in much better financial shape than the typical American household according to Piper Jaffray. Hobby farmers are seeing their income rise faster than the rest of the country and the unemployment rate is lower in non-metropolitan regions. The company\xe2\x80\x99s most recent quarter was excellent, with a 6 cents earnings beat off a 52 cent basis. It reported higher than expected revenues that rose 17.9 percent year-over-year and same-store sales growth of 11.5 percent. It also raised its full year guidance for both revenues and earnings, as well as raising full year same-store sales up to 6.5 to 7 percent.\xe2\x80\x9cTractor Supply is exactly the kind of company that can keep working even if Europe blows up\xe2\x80\x94a domestic retailer with a customer base that\xe2\x80\x99s doing much better than the average American household,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said.(Related: Cramer's Stocking Stuffer: Home Depot)And with TSCO selling at 20 times next year\xe2\x80\x99s earnings, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t expensive when you consider the company\xe2\x80\x99s 17 percent long-term growth rate and its room for expansion.\xe2\x80\x9cI think you buy some here, and given the strength of the story, you can buy even more when it gets knocked down with the rest of the market the next time we get some bad news out of Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

1128,Johnson: The True Cost of Holiday Shopping ,The Guest Blog,29-11-2011,"With Europe in despair and the U.S. economy still sputtering, consumers rolled their eyes like dice, wagering family budgets on Black Friday. Sales increased by 6.6 percentthe day after giving thanks for what we already have, an indication that Congress isn't the only house with a spending problem. As a whole, Americans have $2.4 trillionin consumer debt, $800 billion of which is from credit cards. It's important to note that paying $300 a month on a $10,000 balance of revolving credit at 10 percent would take 10 years longer to satisfy than a fixed loan with identical terms. In the words of Toni Morrison, ""every brothel don't hang a red light in the window"". It's worth noting that consumers moderated their debt and increased savings rates in the wake of the great recession. Whether these modifications are a function of responsible behavior, strict lending practices, the lack of home equity value or some combination of the three remains to be seen. One can only hope the recent $11.4 billion shopping spree doesn't exhume past indiscretions. Money, however, is often used to mask perceived shortcomings. Some employ luxury items to prove past naysayers wrong while others showcase material possessions to legitimize their self worth and make amends for a deprived childhood. There are also legions of financially disabled children marching through the malls, handicapped by the exuberant lifestyle of parents they attempt to imitate without the proper means. The opportunity costs of shopping is reflected in the lackluster savings rates, as the average 401(k) balance is $74,900and 25 percentof baby boomers have nothing set aside for retirement. Compared to other industrialized countries, the U.S. ranks behindCanada, Italy, France, Germany and the United Kingdom in the rate of household savings. And while retirement savings have increased by three percentfrom 2010, a five percent distribution from a diversified portfolio has an estimated 35 percent chance of running out of money within 30 years due to market volatility - every dollar counts. Even those on sound financial footing with clean balance sheets might be unable to maintain the same quality of life once they leave the workforce without an adequate nest egg.

1133,"At Top Colleges, Anti-Wall St. Fervor Complicates Recruiting ",U.S. News,29-11-2011,"College students seeking jobs on Wall Street have always had hurdles to overcome \xe2\x80\x94 grueling applications, endless rounds of interviews, and fierce competition for the relatively few available spots at top firms.This year\xe2\x80\x99s Wall Street hopefuls have had a new force to contend with: The wrath of their peers. Banks and hedge funds have long wooed undergraduates from elite colleges with lavish dinners, personalized e-mails, and free trips to New York for interviews. It\xe2\x80\x99s all part of an annual courtship ritual known as on-campus recruiting. But this fall, the antibank animus of the Occupy Wall Streetmovement has seeped onto college campuses. At some schools, anger at big banks has turned the on-campus recruiting process into a crucible of controversy. \xe2\x80\x9cI teach financial markets, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a little like teaching R.O.T.C. during the Vietnam War,\xe2\x80\x9d said Robert J. Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale University. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have this sense that something\xe2\x80\x99s amiss.\xe2\x80\x9dEven at universities traditionally considered to be Wall Street feeder schools, student bodies are becoming polarized over recruiting. At Harvard, Dartmouth and Cornell, student newspapers have featured polemic columns that urged fellow students to consider working somewhere \xe2\x80\x94 anywhere \xe2\x80\x94 outside finance. At Stanford, an opinion column that took aim at Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9caggressive, sophisticated and well-funded recruitment system\xe2\x80\x9d resulted in \xe2\x80\x9cStop the Brain Drain,\xe2\x80\x9d an online campaign that is trying to stem the tide of top students flooding into banks, hedge funds,  and private equity firms. \xe2\x80\x9cWe think it\xe2\x80\x99s really problematic,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nathan Gusdorf, 22, a senior at Dartmouth College who is an organizer of the Occupy Dartmouth movement. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a culture here that takes a lot of people and directs them towards jobs in the finance industry. We breed a lot of the technocrats who go on to administer the global financial system.\xe2\x80\x9d Wall Street has been steadily losing its allure on college campuses since the financial crisis, when many banks reduced hiring and left many finance-minded graduates in the lurch. Amid new uncertainty and lower profits, banks are again laying off workers, and most of those still working in the industry have seen their paychecks shrink. Goldman Sachs , which was hard hit by this year\xe2\x80\x99s downturn, canceled its fall information session for undergraduates at the University of Pennsylvania, traditionally one of its core recruiting schools. (The firm is still planning to hold a session for summer intern recruits in January.) At Harvard, only 17 percent of last year\xe2\x80\x99s class planned to go into financial services after graduation, according to a survey of graduating seniors, compared with 25 percent in 2006, before the crisis. But with the added vitriol of Occupy Wall Street, this year\xe2\x80\x99s recruiting process is even more forbidding.

1134,New Rules of Supply and Demand: Sacrificing Inventory To Save the Store,Small Business,29-11-2011,"When John Goldman strolled through his Rhode Island jewelry stores, he used to see every piece on sale as an asset. The pricey silver necklaces gleaming in display cases until they sold as special gifts \xe2\x80\x94 all were assets. So were the $19 earrings that thrifty shoppers snapped up quickly.Now Goldman knows that some of his glittering stock can sink his business, an independent chain called Green River Silver Co. whose rapid growth stalled after the financial crisis of 2008. As sales ebbed, Goldman hired consultant Ted Hurlbut, who told him his heavier necklaces were dangerous liabilities. That stock was weighing down profits while it sat unsold. \xe2\x80\x9cTed suggested that we literally liquidate it,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 said Goldman, who got cash from silver dealerships that melted down his less attractive heavy jewelry. Goldman is one of the small business owners forced by the recession to focus on the exacting discipline of inventory management, the art of fine-tuning the mix of stock on hand to maximize profits. Even in good times, slow-moving inventory like Goldman\xe2\x80\x99s necklaces ties up capital. It can also carry other costs, such as warehousing. Now, in the current climate of tight credit and weak consumer demand, excess inventory can threaten the survival of both tiny companies and huge ones.

1170,El-Erian: Can European Hope be Turned Quickly into Reality? ,The Guest Blog,29-11-2011,"Jim Cramer has brilliantly posed the most important question facing the markets today when thinking about the impact of Europe: ""Is there too much hope here?"" The reason for renewed hope is three fold: Germany and France are now pushing simultaneously on two fronts to meaningfully strengthen the institutional underpinning of the Eurozone; there are signs that the IMF may get more involved, and possibly in a consequential manner; and we are likely to hear later today about the outcome of efforts to enhance the EFSF (both sources and uses). But for the markets to sustain this week's rally, it is critical for hope to be translated into reality over the next ten days; and that this be done in a manner that induces the ECB to go ""all in."" In this context, investors should monitor closely indications that, in the run up to the December 9th European Summit, at least nine Eurozone countries are readily buying into the Franco-German initiatives. They should also assess whether the EFSF is being realistically and consequentially strengthening. Without quick progress on these two issues, the ECB's reluctance would persist, and understandably so. After all, it is a monetary institution that has already engaged its balance sheet in a meaningful (and previously unthinkable) manner, yet to no avail when it comes to decisively fixing Europe's crisis. So rather than continue just to contaminate its balance sheet, it is seeking assurances that it can be a bridge to somewhere. In turn, this brings up other complicated issues. Can policymakers quickly reverse the damage donelast week to the functioning of key Eurozone markets? Can the growing fragility of the banking system be reversed? And, given that debt sustainability involves both a numerator and a denominator (namely, debt load and resources to make payments, respectively), can Europe combine debt containment with growth and employment promotion? Your analysis of all this is what translates into an answer to Jim's key question.

That computer runs software which is as vulnerable as the computer inside a PC. We found a way to completely re-write the printer's software to do bad things. We were trying to inject security to prevent it from being attacked when we found this major flaw,"" says Columbia professor Salvatore Stolfo, the researchers' director.A report on MSNBC.com suggested the flaw could be used to give a printer ""instructions so frantic that it could eventually catch fire.""The researchers don't agree. ""We were not able to make the printer go on fire. That wasn't the purpose of the research. There is a thermal switch. When the printer reached a critical temperature, it cuts the power,"" Stolfo explained. ""It's not the hardware, it's the software that's the problem.""\xc2\xa0 In its news release, Hewlett-Packard noted that all of its LaserJet printers have a ""thermal breaker"" that prevents overheating.\xc2\xa0 The company said the hardware protection ""cannot be overcome by a firmware change or this proposed vulnerability.""The MSNBC.com report said that in a demonstration, the printer did shut itself down before a fire started, ""but the researchers believe other printers might be used as fire starters, giving computer hackers a dangerous new tool that could allow simple computer code to wreak real-world havoc.""HP said it is working to remove the vulnerability.\xc2\xa0 ""HP is building a firmware upgrade to mitigate this issue and will be communicating this proactively to customers and partners who may be impacted. In the meantime, HP reiterates its recommendation to follow best practices for securing devices by placing printers behind a firewall and, where possible, disabling remote firmware upload on exposed printers."" The revelation here is that printers can be remotely controlled over the internet. As HP recommends, a firewall is the best way to restricts access to authorized users only.\xc2\xa0 You'll need a password to access it, thus blocking the worldwide web. If you're using a corporate computer, your server likely has a firewall between it and the Internet. The strength of the firewall on these and other printers, however, is still an open question. ""Printers belong to a class of single-purpose devices, which are ubiquitous. While there is embedded software in them, there is no anti-virus that runs on them. Embedded systems are inherently insecure. The industry should pay attention,"" adds Stolfo. ",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/29/hp-smacks-down-printer-fire-report.html

There are still companies out there you can count on, like Home Depot. The home improvement retailer  just boosted its dividend by 16 percent two weeks ago, bringing the yield up to 3.1 percent. And that yield is big enough to price a nice cushion of support if the stock gets slammed as a result of a market-wide sell-off.\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the kind of stock you can own, in part because if Europe does cause us to crash, Home Depot won't fall as hard as the rest of the market ... and it will bounce back much harder,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. Home Depot\xe2\x80\x99s most recent quarterly results, reported on November 15, prove that concerns over the housing market haven\xe2\x80\x99t hurt the company. It delivered a 2 cent earnings beat off a 58 cent basis courtesy of stronger-than-expected revenues. Best of all, HD raised its earnings guidance for the 2012 fiscal year. And in addition to that 16 percent dividend boost, the company raised its payout ratio from 40 percent of the earnings per share to 50 percent, which sets the stage for several years of potential dividend boosts in the future. Home Depot is also a classic turnaround story. Over the last few years, CEO Frank Blake has been aggressively restructuring the company by doing things like cutting costs and increasing productivity.Trading at 13.7 times earnings, Cramer thinks the stock is a bargain.

1188,Crescenzi: Fed Addresses European Bank Strains ,The Guest Blog,30-11-2011,"The coordinated actionsby the Federal Reserve  and other central banks is aimed at the funding strains faced by European banks in what was becoming a modern day run on the banks. The run has differed from the run that George Bailey watched as he drove up to the Bailey Building and Loan in It\xe2\x80\x99s a Wonderful Life, but it has been a run nonetheless. The world in fact has been playing a game of hot potato with European bank debt as well as European sovereign debt, and the only player with oven mitts to hold the hot potato is the world\xe2\x80\x99s central banks. Illustrating the run on European banks is the sharp reduction in exposures by U.S. institutional prime money funds to European banks. For years the prime money funds invested about 50% of their investable money in European banks. This lasted until June. Since then, data from Fitch indicate the tally has fallen to 35%. Further evidence of strain has been in the inter-bank market, in particular LIBOR . Whereas in June the 3-month LIBOR hovered close to the 0.25% rate the Fed pays on excess bank reserves, it was today at 0.53%, indicating banks were having increased difficulty obtaining dollar funding. Moreover, forward rates on LIBOR were priced for 3-month LIBOR to eventually reach about 85 basis points and the trend was accelerating. Keep in mind that any use of the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s swap facility expands the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s monetary base: all dollars, no matter where they are deposited, whether it be Kazakhstan, Japan, or Mexico, wind up back in an American bank. This means that any time a foreign central bank engages in a swap with the Federal Reserve, the Fed will create new money in order to make the swap. Use of the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s liquidity swap line in late 2008 was the main cause of a surge in the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s monetary base at that time. The peak for the swap line was about $600 billion in December 2008. Some observers will therefore say that the swap line is a backdoor way to engage in more quantitative easing . The provision of liquidity is no substitute for other actions that Europe must take to solve its current woes. The world continues to wait on European actions on fiscal rules, discipline, and enforcement as well as use of the balance sheet that matters most in the current situation: the European Central Bank . It remains a fact that Ben Bernanke is one of the few true deciders these days on the global policy stage. Tony Crescenzi is Executive VP, Strategist, Portfolio Manager PIMCO.

1189,Sports Bar Owners Relieved That NBA Lockout Is Finally Over ,Small Business,30-11-2011,"On Christmas Day, the economy will get a gift: the basketball season. As basketball fans well know, the 2011-2012 season looked to be in jeopardy, with no consensus on how $4 billion in revenue should be split between the players and the National Basketball Association.But all has been resolved now, and while it may not seem like it at first glance, with the 150-day basketball strike ending and the first games returning on Dec. 25, an innumerable number of small-business owners are now breathing a sigh of relief. ""I'm very happy that everything is resolved,"" says Peter Lucido, owner of the Greatest Bar in Boston.

1190,Blog: Rich People Don't Make Their Money by Keeping Other Workers from Making Money,The Guest Blog,30-11-2011,"In January, 2009, President Obama told the banksthat it was OK to make profits, but that \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d (the year 2009 I assume) is not the time. Of course, the banks had lost a lot of money and needed profits to \xe2\x80\x9crecapitalize\xe2\x80\x9d their balance sheets and enhance their soundness. Not earning money would have contributed to the weakness of the banking sector. It is not clear whether the President was talking only to the banks, or if his view extended to other firms, movie actors, highly paid athletes etc. The concept of profits has never been in favor among those who think that making a profit is the exploitation of labor. Indeed, the Soviet Union never used the concept which is one big reason why they failed so miserably. Profits tell us whether or not resources are being used efficiently and the Soviets didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a clue. In the U.S., a failure to make profits is a signal that resources are being misused and mismanaged. Many who have this view further allege that those making a lot of money are doing it at the expense of others, so every dollar a \xe2\x80\x9crich\xe2\x80\x9d person makes could have been made by a \xe2\x80\x9cpoor\xe2\x80\x9d person had the rich person not taken it. Other facets of this perspective suggest that it is not the value of output that should determine compensation, but just the number of hours worked and that all hours worked might even have the same value (we should all have equal incomes regardless of what we produce). Of course, millions of \xe2\x80\x9cpoor\xe2\x80\x9d people get an income and don\xe2\x80\x99t work at all. This is a view that is totally alien to the fundamentals of free markets and individual freedom where workers are free to find the employment that offers the highest wage (their highest value to a firm) and where employers cannot pay more than the value the worker creates for the firm. If the owner of the firm does well, he or she gets paid well (profits) and is rewarded by attracting more competition which is the discipline on profits made. The notion that the rich only make money at the expense of a valuable worker presumes that the worker is not free to find better pay elsewhere based on their contribution to the efforts of a firm which would find it \xe2\x80\x9cprofitable\xe2\x80\x9d to hire them. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a thought experiment.If it is true that the rich make their money by preventing others from making money, how about we get the rich to stop working for a year or two so that the \xe2\x80\x9cpoor\xe2\x80\x9d can catch up? If the rich stop making money, then the poor can have it and will make more. Think about it. No doubt some compensation deals are inappropriate by any market performance measure and that boards of directors have often done a poor job of managing compensation, many co-opted by management (in my view, the Chairman of the Board, which represents shareholders, should never be the President/CEO). But the compensation of highly paid individuals doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come by suppressing worker pay (more likely paid for by customers in the prices of goods and services) and is rarely a major expense item relative to business revenues. There are more logical economic explanations for the growth in highly paid individuals and \xe2\x80\x9cclass warfare\xe2\x80\x9d will not change these, history has proven that.

1195,Note to Naysayers: Things Are Improving,Economy,30-11-2011,"On our show Street Signs we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking much about the concept of \xe2\x80\x98hopium\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 that bizarre concoction of hope and optimism that may synthesize into an ""economic drug,"" propelling the economyinto an upward spiral.Confidence is, after all, everything. Especially in an economy three-fourths powered by the simple decisions of consumers and companies every day to spend money. It is also a very fickle thing. Becoming more optimistic after my own five years of pessimism hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been easy, particularly in this new world where negativity rules the day and he who can be most sarcastic and outrageous seems to capture the headlines. The naysayers are as plentiful as they are loud in their conviction we\xe2\x80\x99re doomed. Doomed by Europe. Doomed by an ineffective Congress. Doomed by the Federal Reserve and its easy money policies. You name it, they\xe2\x80\x99ve used it in their bearish arguments. They\xe2\x80\x99ve even been able to discount the big run of better-than-expected economic data we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten over the past few months, mostly by questioning the very calculation of the data itself or the intentions behind it. But data and data-bashing be damned.My recent optimism doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come from the weeds or some random page of the Beige Book. It comes from conversations with those in the (gasp) real world. Friends, family, and business contacts who (shock) are actually working. They are realtors, truckers, software salesmen, tax preparers, roofers, and more. They are all far off Wall Street. They hail from Virginia, Kansas, Wisconsin, and other parts long removed from the capital of capital. They are building, moving, and selling things. They know Europe has problems, but none can say that any client or customer has mentioned Athens or the European Central Bank  as an excuse to cancel an order. To a person they tell me that things are improving. One salesman buddy of mine tells me he\xe2\x80\x99s having his \xe2\x80\x9cbest year ever.\xe2\x80\x9d In the crazy business of business television, going against the vocal tide is tough. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost hip to be a downer, especially in the age of Twitter and blogs that love to tell you how wrong or mentally deficient you are (generally in not such polite ways).No one is suggesting things are great. I grade the U.S. economy a ""C,"" maybe a ""C+."" But that\xe2\x80\x99s at least a grade higher than we were testing at a year ago. If jobs don\xe2\x80\x99t start to grow in a meaningful way, those may be the best grades we get for a few more semesters.That said, scores and sales are rising. And though many seem to hate to hear it, after a number of down years I don\xe2\x80\x99t hate to say it: Things are indeed getting better in America.

1199,Cramer: Why You Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t Buy Banks,Mad Money,30-11-2011,"Stocks rallied sharply Wednesday, with financials leading the S&P higher, after global central banks announced a plan to ease the strain on the world\xe2\x80\x99s financial system. But that\xe2\x80\x99s still not a reason to buy the banks, \xe2\x80\x9cMad Money\xe2\x80\x9d host Jim Cramer said.\xe2\x80\x9cThe reasons to stay away are so powerful that it\xe2\x80\x99s not even worth considering the reasons why the banks might be worth buying,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.While some, like noted bank analyst Dick Bove, have been saying banks are a bargain, Cramer said right now the fundamentals just don\xe2\x80\x99t matter. The powerful reason to stay away is a big picture, macro-economic one:\xc2\xa0 Europe. Take Citigroup , for example. It was upgraded by Credit Suisse to \xe2\x80\x98outperform\xe2\x80\x99 from \xe2\x80\x98neutral\xe2\x80\x99 at the beginning of the month and two weeks ago Oppenheimer reiterated its \xe2\x80\x98outperform\xe2\x80\x99 rating on the stock. In both reports there were vast details of the business but scant attention was paid to Europe. On the flip side, Morgan Stanley recently downgraded Citigroup from \xe2\x80\x98overweight\xe2\x80\x99 to \xe2\x80\x98neutral.\xe2\x80\x99 That report, as well, was rooted in the fundamentals. But whether Citigroup\xe2\x80\x99s business is doing well or not takes a back seat to the fact that banks are punished when something bad happens in Europe. Cramer thinks the only way to own a bank in this environment is if has a business model that is focused on deposits and if it didn\xe2\x80\x99t play in credit default swaps\xe2\x80\x94something like Toronto Dominion .The bottom line\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever good things might be happening at Citigroup or any other big American bank will always be outweighed by the bad from Europe until this crisis is finally resolved \xe2\x80\xa6 and we\xe2\x80\x99re nowhere near a resolution,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. \xe2\x80\x9cUntil then, shopping for bank stocks is a total exercise in futility.\xe2\x80\x9dCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

1223,Massive Coordinated Central Bank Action Inspires Risk Rally,Currency Contest,30-11-2011,"Early session price action saw a resumption of risk off trade, with the lack of positive headlines or signs of resolution at the Eurozone FinMin meeting inspiring a fresh round of intraday risk liquidation. But markets remained well supported on dips and the picture changed ahead of the North American open as news hit the wires that China had cut the RRR by 50bps. This in conjunction with rumored ECB activity was enough to temper broader concerns, and helped to rally risk assets. Then a bombshell was delivered when the Fed, ECB, BOJ, BOE, SNB and Bank of Canada announced a coordinated central bank action to lower swap rates by 50bps effective December 5.However, we remain skeptical with any rallies in risk correlated assets and feel that the China news and central bank activity while necessary, only reinforce the fact that the contagion from the Eurozone is in fact spreading to the global economy and necessary measures need to be taken to address the severity of the situation. To us, this is ultimately risk negative.Looking ahead, we recommend keeping a close watch on the Yen, as we contend that this currency will soon fall victim to relative underperformance even in risk off market environments as pressures mount for official action on the currency\xe2\x80\x99s behalf. We have seen a number of Japanese officials speak out on the subject, with BOJ Nishimura the latest to warn of the possibility for additional intervention. There are stops above 78.30 in USD/JPY, so look for a break above to accelerate gains.Moving on, month end flows could also be a factor in Wednesday trade, and it is worth taking this into consideration. Markets have a way of moving more aggressively on the final day of the month and given the existing volatility, we could see some big moves. Looking ahead, in North America, US ADP employment, Canada GDP, Chicago PMI and US pending home sales are the stand out releases.

1226,Morici: Lackluster Jobs Report Expected ,The Guest Blog,30-11-2011,"Friday, forecasters expect the Labor Department to report the economy added only 120,000 jobs in November, after scoring a nonplus 80,000 gain in October. The three month moving average stands at 120,000 jobs, a pace inadequate to much lower unemployment.The unemployment rate is expected to stay at 9.0 percent, mainly because so many displaced professionals report themselves as \xe2\x80\x9cself-employed,\xe2\x80\x9d when working only a few hours a week from home. Even before escalating troubles in Europe and China are considered, the economic outlook is mediocre, with GDP growth expected at about 2 percent\xe2\x80\x94hardly enough jobs to absorb adult population growth. With Italy likely to default in a manner similar to Greece, and new questions raised about China\xe2\x80\x99s accounting practices, fraudulent stock and bank reports, and inflation and growth statistics, all risks are to the downside. Without more assertive efforts to address America\xe2\x80\x99s structural problems\xe2\x80\x94huge trade deficits with China and on oil, and ineffective and expensive regulations in banking and health care, America is headed for a protracted period of high youth unemployment and permanent displacement of many older workers. These conditions are not destiny\xe2\x80\x94solutions are at hand but leadership and a genuine willingness to compromise, absent excessive partisanship, are required to progress. Too Little Economic Growth Consumer spending and economic growth have recovered from their first half nadir, and GDP growth will be about 2 percent in the latter half of 2011. Broad gains in consumer spending, business investment and exports are high points. Auto sales have firmed. Businesses and commuters faced strong financial incentives to replace cars and trucks as the vehicle fleet grew older during the Great Recession\xe2\x80\x94the math for buying as opposed to refurbishing many vehicles is solid. Appliance sales are more heavily focused on replacement sales than would be with stronger new home sales. Housing remains weak but for some recovery in the construction of new rental units, as for many young households economic calculations favor renting over owning\xe2\x80\x94even with rock bottom prices for existing homes in many parts of the country. The inability to sell homes reasonably fast, if employment considerations compel, makes owning too risky for many young workers. Weak inventory build indicates retailers expect consumer spending has recovered about all that is possible. That makes a lot of sense, Black Friday and Cyber Monday gains notwithstanding. Much has been made of the need for consumers to rebuild their balance sheets\xe2\x80\x94that requires working down debt on credit cards and lowering mortgages. The former was largely completed by last April. Now, household net worth and liquidity will not improve much further until the value of existing homes rebounds, but housing prices continue to move south Sadly, millions of foreclosuresand second homes purchased for speculative reasons during the boom will keep the market oversupplied for much of this decade. Also, many existing homes are too far from jobs and too large\xe2\x80\x94those made more sense when gasoline and heating costs were low but not with oil near $100 a barrel. Overall, economic growth at about 2 percent\xe2\x80\x94and certainly now better than 2.5 percent\xe2\x80\x94can be expected through 2012. Jobs Outlook The economy must grow at about 2.5 to 3 percent\xe2\x80\x94long term\xe2\x80\x94to keep unemployment steady. Simply, potential labor productivity rises, thanks to better technology, about 2 percent each year, and labor force growth is about 1 percent a year, owing to natural population increase. Together, those translate into a 3 percent trend rate of economic growth with unemployment steady. If conditions are mediocre and businesses cautious, productivity growth can slip\xe2\x80\x94equipment and computers are kept beyond their economically useful life. Then unemployment can be kept steady with 2.5 percent growth or even 2 percent but that poses risks. Anecdotal reports indicate that businesses are extraordinary reluctant to hire. They don\xe2\x80\x99t expect a recession but are gearing for persistent subpar growth in the United States, slower growth in Asia and virtually no growth or a recession in Europe. Many firms will meet modestly growing demand with smaller workforces\xe2\x80\x94exploiting labor saving strategies to boost profits. Lower head counts could ignite a negative feedback cycle\xe2\x80\x94fewer employees at enough firms spell lower spending and less demand for all firms and then layoffs cascade. The U.S. economy moving along at 2 or 2.5 percent growth is like an airplane flying at low altitude. In a steady environment, the plane can keep going, but the slightest downdraft, never mind an unexpected tall obstacle, and the plane ditches. And a tall obstacle may soon emerge across the pond. Overall, if the recovery is not derailed, continue to expect jobs growth of about 120,000 a month, and not much positive movement in the 9 percent unemployment rate. Also, many adults are discouraged and not looking for work altogether, and not counted among the unemployed. Others hold part-time positions but would prefer full-time work. Factoring in those adults who say they would rejoin the labor force if conditions were better and part-timers who would prefer full-time positions, the unemployment rate is about 16.5 percent. Adding college graduates in low skill positions, like counterwork at Starbucks, and the unemployment rate is likely closer to 20 percent. What Is Needed The economy must add 13.3 million jobs over the next three years\xe2\x80\x94369,000 each month\xe2\x80\x94to bring unemployment down to 6 percent. Considering continuing layoffs at state and local governments and federal spending cuts, private sector jobs must increase at least 400,000 a month to accomplish that goal. GDP growth in the range of 4 to 5 percent is needed to get unemployment down to 6 percent over the next several years. The outlook for 2012 indicates growth in the range of 2 or 2.5 percent, and that puts the economy at severe risk to any kind of shock\xe2\x80\x94financial panic in Europe, implosion in China or an oil price spike. Growth is weak and jobs are in jeopardy, because temporary tax cuts, stimulus spending, and easy monetary policy are not enough to address the chronically weak demand holding back economic recovery. Large trade deficits overwhelm the positive effects of Washington\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to jump start the economy. Oil and trade with China account for nearly the entire $550 billion trade deficit, and dollars sent abroad to purchase oil and consumer goods from China that do not return to purchase U.S. exports are lost purchasing power. Consequently, the U.S. economy is expanding at about 2 to 2.5 percent a year instead of the 5 percent pace that is possible after emerging from a deep recession and with such high unemployment. Without prompt efforts to produce more domestic oil, redress the trade imbalance with China and the rest of Asia, the U.S. economy cannot grow and create enough jobs. Moreover, without efforts to lower costs by curbing a Washington regulatory bureaucracy out of control and health care executives gorging while pushing up insurance costs, the cost of doing business will remain too high, and real wages and living standards for most Americans will not improve.

Choruses of \xe2\x80\x9cAll engines, Reverse.\xe2\x80\x9d But one of the first rules of physics is that objects in motion tend to stay in motion. Movies are filled with nail-biting moments of split-second disaster aversion. We hope that many of the world\xe2\x80\x99s more difficult dilemmas will also be met with similar Hollywood-style happy endings. China has been tightening monetary policy and reserve requirements for its banks \xe2\x80\x93 until today. Today, in a reversal of what has been an established policy trend, China lowered reserve requirements for its banks by one half percent. The ECB, Fed and other central banks coordinated a reduction in dollar funding for European banks from 1% to 0.5% over the established benchmark rate. Congressional Republicans are now discussing extending the payroll tax-cut. Do you see the trend? All of today\xe2\x80\x99s actions and discussions facilitate greater liquidity around the world and make important funding available and affordable to European banks in extremis. To boot, in a speech yesterday by Fed Vice Chair Janet Yellen, there were clear indications that important language used in Fed press releases may change to indicate future changes in Fed policy. Markets around the globe exploded with exuberance in response to all this news as share prices leapt significantly higher. These moves represent good news and bad news. Support and assistance are not offered, nor are they needed, by the strong and fit. The remarkable actions taken today uncover grave opinions that necessitate profound actions. We are encouraged that these global issues are being addressed and believe that this is a good start. However, this may be the beginning rather than the end of the discussion. Today\xe2\x80\x99s increased liquidity does not address the real problem of troubled European sovereign debt that threatens the solvency of European banks and almost guarantees a European recession. Nor will an extension of the payroll tax cut create the kind of economic growth necessary to replace the 8 million jobs lost in the US during the Great Recession. And finally, a 0.50% reduction in Chinese reserve requirements will not offset the massive export exposure that country has to Europe. Nevertheless, disaster seems to have been once again averted in the final hour, and the world financial markets are grateful. Today\xe2\x80\x99s magnificent headlines and major events have dwarfed yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s downgrade by Standard & Poor\xe2\x80\x99s, which has become a notorious and consistent late-comer to the party, of most major US banks. As well, today\xe2\x80\x99s action has drowned out the volatile rhetoric coming out of Iran yesterday. As world events evolve, it is important not to become overly ebullient or fearful.

What Today's Action Means,Net Net: Promoting innovation and managing change,30-11-2011,"The attempt by major central banks to ease strainson Europe's credit markets certainly cheered financial markets on Wednesday, but what does the coordinated action actually do?",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/11/30/central-banks-to-the-rescue-what-todays-action-means.html
1248,"Busch: Finally, Global Action for a Global Crisis",The Guest Blog,30-11-2011,"Today, six central banks acted to reduce funding tensions in the global financial markets. The EUR rallied 200 points , S&P is up 35 and US 10yr yields are up 10bps at 2.07%. Here's the Federal Reserve statement: The Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, and the Swiss National Bank are today announcing coordinated actions to enhance their capacity to provide liquidity support to the global financial system. The purpose of these actions is to ease strains in financial markets and thereby mitigate the effects of such strains on the supply of credit to households and businesses and so help foster economic activity. These central banks have agreed to lower the pricing on the existing temporary U.S. dollar liquidity swap arrangements by 50 basis points so that the new rate will be the U.S. dollar overnight index swap (OIS) rate plus 50 basis points. This pricing will be applied to all operations conducted from December 5, 2011. The authorization of these swap arrangements has been extended to February 1, 2013. In addition, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank will continue to offer three-month tenders until further notice. As a contingency measure, these central banks have also agreed to establish temporary bilateral liquidity swap arrangements so that liquidity can be provided in each jurisdiction in any of their currencies should market conditions so warrant. At present, there is no need to offer liquidity in non-domestic currencies other than the U.S. dollar, but the central banks judge it prudent to make the necessary arrangements so that liquidity support operations could be put into place quickly should the need arise. These swap lines are authorized through February 1, 2013. Federal Reserve Actions ""The Federal Open Market Committee has authorized an extension of the existing temporary U.S. dollar liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank through February 1, 2013. The rate on these swap arrangements has been reduced from the U.S. dollar OIS rate plus 100 basis points to the OIS rate plus 50 basis points. In addition, as a contingency measure, the Federal Open Market Committee has agreed to establish similar temporary swap arrangements with these five central banks to provide liquidity in any of their currencies if necessary. Further details on the revised arrangements will be available shortly. U.S. financial institutions currently do not face difficulty obtaining liquidity in short-term funding markets. However, were conditions to deteriorate, the Federal Reserve has a range of tools available to provide an effective liquidity backstop for such institutions and is prepared to use these tools as needed to support financial stability and to promote the extension of credit to U.S. households and businesses.""Connect to this global liquidity actionthe strong ADP employmentdata today and a 50bp RRR cut by the PBOC and you get a powerful move for the end of month. This could lead to a strong yearend rally if (big if here) Europe can stabilize. We expect to get information on a new fiscal union structure over the next 10 days that should provide a basis for stability. (Yes, there have been numerous and disastrous false starts on Europe solving their problems. Therefore, healthy skepticism is required.) Summing it up: policy makers continue to act when markets become extreme. It's step one in 50 that have to be taken, but at least it was done. Andrew B.

1249,"Central Bank Moves a Good First Step, Pros Say",Halftime Report,30-11-2011,"Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s move by central banks in various countries to improve liquidity in the world\xe2\x80\x99s financial system helped the market rally, but \xe2\x80\x9cFast Money\xe2\x80\x9d experts questioned its lasting impact. \xe2\x80\x9cPsychologically, it\xe2\x80\x99s quite important. In Europe we have have policy makers, or politicians that don\xe2\x80\x99t have a vision,\xe2\x80\x9d said Louise Cooper of BGC Partners. \xe2\x80\x9cTherefore, it\xe2\x80\x99s always encouraging to see central bankers \xe2\x80\x94 the other policy makers \xe2\x80\x94 that are: 1) Working together in a coordinated way. That is a good thing. And, 2) trying to ease some of the problems of the credit markets.\xe2\x80\x9d But she added that it would \xe2\x80\x9cprobably not\xe2\x80\x9d ease the credit crunch significantly. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes I think the equity markets just don\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand how credit markets work,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. One important number is the European Central Bank\xe2\x80\x99s daily liquidity, which Cooper said shows how much money is banked overnight \xe2\x80\x9cby healthy banks with the ECB because they they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lend it out to anyone else.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThat has reached enormous levels,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re looking at \xe2\x80\x94 overnight last night \xe2\x80\x94 300 billion euro.\xe2\x80\x9d Cooper also noted that there have been large equity moves, such as the DAX, up 11 percent and Societe Generale, up 17 percent. \xe2\x80\x9cI think there\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit of fear that if you\xe2\x80\x99re running a European equity portfolio and you\xe2\x80\x99re not performing and you see a massive rally in just a few days, you want to be in because that three-day rally could cost you your job,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Commodities trader Dennis Gartman noted that money is moving away from European markets and toward Canada, Australia and the United States, but he weighed in favorably on the move by the ECB, the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Japan and Switzerland.\xe2\x80\x9cIs this the end-all? Is this the be-all? No, it\xe2\x80\x99s the first step,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s at least give it credit for that.\xe2\x80\x9d Trader Jon Najarian said it was not the time to write off Europe. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe that the euro is in trouble, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be in the way of it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be short the euro at this time.\xe2\x80\x9d ______________________________________________________Got something to to say?

The European Central Bank, U.S. Federal Reserve, Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Japan and Switzerland agreed to coordinated action to ease the increasing strains on the global financial system.The move is designed to ""enhance their capacity to provide liquidity support to the global financial system."" Had global central banks failed to intervene, Cramer thinks there would have been a Lehman Brothers-style event in the next ten days, especially since lending to most European banks had been dwindling. On September 15, 2008, Lehman filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, marking the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history.With the likelihood of such a bankruptcy off the table, the markets drew their attention to better-than-expected economic news out of the U.S. The pace of job growth in the private sector accelerated in November, with U.S. employers adding 206,000 jobs, according to the ADP National Employment report. Also on the jobs front, the number of planned layoffs at U.S. firms edged down 0.7 percent in November, according to a report from consultants Challenger, Gray & Christmas.The Fed's Beige Book showed that economic activity in most major U.S. regions increased at a slow to moderate pace over the last two months.Meanwhile, business activity in the Midwest grew faster than expected in November as orders surged, according to the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago business barometer. And pending home sales jumped in October by the most in nearly a year to 10.4 percent, according to the National Association of Realtors.Given the overall improved outlook, should investors continue to play the rally? \xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately, I can't give you a totally straight answer, only a bifurcated one, because painting with too broad a brush in this market is a recipe for disaster in this market,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer explained.The \xe2\x80\x9cMad Money\xe2\x80\x9d host reiterated that investors should consider buying American companies, such as retailers thanks to a robust consumer. Oil is another sector to consider, as demand remains high and tensions grow in Iran. He also likes high-yielding stocks, whether they are industrials, master limited partnerships or health care names. On the same token, though, he would use this strength to sell any bank stocks because the sector likely faces further challenges down the road, such as greater regulation. Investors could also start selling technology stocks that are up, but only if the fundamentals aren\xe2\x80\x99t any good. He thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to lighten up on any stocks that don\xe2\x80\x99t yield as much as they did on Friday.\xe2\x80\x94Reuters contributed to this reportCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

1256,This Commodity Near Level of Ridiculousness: Top Trader,Fast Money,30-11-2011,"His name may not be familiar to Main Street, but on Wall Street it\xe2\x80\x99s widely known and widely respected.We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about Mark Fisher, the Founder/CEO of MBF Clearing Corp.Fisher started as a \xe2\x80\x98runner\xe2\x80\x99 on the floor of the COMEX in the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s and over the years his aptitude for trading made him among the most respected money pros in the world.Fisher is also a student of the markets as well as author of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Logical Trader: Applying A Method to The Madness.\xe2\x80\x9d On Wednesday November 30th Fisher joined the Fast Money gang on the desk for the hour-long Fast at 5 broadcast.Because it\xe2\x80\x99s not unusual for pro traders to analyze his every move, we thought you might appreciate having his latest comments all in one place, to more easily glean insights. Mark Fisher's thoughts on four major trading themes follow:1. Sharp Stock Market RallyFisher thinks the S&P continues to rally but he\xe2\x80\x99s not sure for how long. \xe2\x80\x9cRight now, I think money managers are caught under-invested,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. That suggests into the end of the year the market will see a chase for performance. However he also thinks the rally hits a wall. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the rally ends in December or January but I think it ends.\xe2\x80\x9d2. Nat GasIf you\xe2\x80\x99re short nat gas you might want to cover. Fisher tells us that nat gas is approaching a level of \xe2\x80\x98ridiculousness.\xe2\x80\x99He sees nat gas climbing in both the short-term and long-term.\xe2\x80\x9dOver the next 2-4 weeks, I think we see a weather scare that will cause nat gas to jump. And in the long-term, he says, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m probably early but I think we\xe2\x80\x99re near the start of a big bull market in nat gas.\xe2\x80\x9d3. Crude OilFisher doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think investors who trade oil understand the significance of events underway in the Mideast.\xe2\x80\x9dInvestors are underestimating the importance of what's happening in Iran. If something happened to Iranian production, whether an embargo or whatever, we could see the price of oil jump as much as $25 in time minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d4. BanksIt might be worth putting BofA  on the radar. Fisher tells us that \xe2\x80\x9cBofA under $5 is almost like a bet on the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBofA under $5 is like Citi under $1,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.We take that to mean around $5 the path of least resistance for BofA should be higher because the only thing that would drive the stock much lower would be a belief that the government won\xe2\x80\x99t backstop the firm \xe2\x80\x93 and Fisher doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see that scenario playing out in any capacity.______________________________________________________Got something to to say?

1265,The 24 Days of Black Friday,Consumer Nation,01-12-2011,"In the wake of this year's Black Friday shopping frenzy, some were asking how retailers were going to do to maintain the momentum throughout the holiday shopping season. We now have the answer: Let's make it Black Friday everyday!And they're not the only ones in on the act. Online retailers decided that if Cyber Monday was good, Cyber Week is even better. Just take a look at a sample of the announcements that have rolled into my inbox:Toys 'R Us issued a press release saying, ""Save Like It's Black Friday.""The toy retailer will be opening its doors on Sat., Dec. 3 at 6 am and will offer 85 ""mystery doorbusters"" as well as some sales it previously announced. But if shoppers want in on the ""secret,"" they can go to , to their Facebook page, or watch their email or mobile phones, if they're registered to get sales alerts, beginning Friday night. These deals will include some steep markdowns. For example, Hasbro's Furreal Friends Butterscotch Pony, will be marked down $100 to $99.99, while shoppers can save $70 on Step2's Neat & Tidy Cottage, which also will be selling for $99.99.

1294,"Money Flows, but What Euro Zone Lacks Is Glue",Europe News,01-12-2011,"As European Union leaders prepare for yet another crisis summit meeting next week to discuss fundamental changes in economic governing, there are growing concerns that the latest potential approach \xe2\x80\x94 a more aggressive intervention by the European Central Bank \xe2\x80\x94 will not be enough to stabilize the markets and preserve the euro.The assumption has been that if political leaders can convince voters in their countries that they are capable of enforcing greater discipline and centralized intervention in national budgets, as Germany demands, then the European Central Bank will have the political breathing space to move more aggressively to support the bond sales of Spain and especially Italy. The thought is that the bank can flood the market, driving down interest rates to tolerable levels, buying time for Europe to fix its debt problems and overhaul laggard economies.But with Europe veering toward recession and with increased skepticism that discipline will solve the deep structural imbalances in the euro zone, the markets\xe2\x80\x99 concerns have passed from doubts about the solvency of individual countries to fears for the euro zone as a whole. Those doubts now include Germany, which cannot by itself, even if it wishes to, guarantee the credibility of Italian and Spanish debt, which totals more than $3.3 trillion.For Kenneth S. Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard, the biggest problem for the euro is not money so much as structure, or the lack of it. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a deep constitutional and institutional problem in Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Rogoff said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a funding problem.\xe2\x80\x9dYet, with even German interest rates rising, the markets are now worried about the sustainability of the euro zone as a whole, said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund and a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management. \xe2\x80\x9cThe market has signaled that the risk is relative currency risk, not sovereign risk,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Johnson said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo a \xe2\x80\x98big bazooka\xe2\x80\x99 won\xe2\x80\x99t work for Europe now, because of worries about the euro itself breaking up and German interest rates going up.\xe2\x80\x9dThe last plan that was supposed to stop the rot, agreed upon last July but not put fully into place until mid-October, was the European Financial Stability Facility , with a lending capacity of 440 billion euros, or about $587 billion. While large enough to cover, as intended, a second Greek bailout, Ireland and Portugal, it is far too small for Italy and Spain, which are now in play.And efforts to \xe2\x80\x9cleverage\xe2\x80\x9d the fund upward, a crucial element of the \xe2\x80\x9cbig bazooka\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Johnson referred to, are falling considerably short of the $1.35 trillion target, European officials acknowledged Wednesday. That failure is in large part because, as Mr. Johnson noted, the bond spreads for even the AAA-rated euro zone countries are going up, leaving less leeway for leveraging.Mr. Johnson is a euro hawk, predicting a breakup of the euro zone. Others say Europe has more time, especially if the European Central Bank can intervene to support Italy more forcefully, which by its charter it is not supposed to do, at least not directly.If so, Mr. Rogoff said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Europeans can stretch it out a long time, they have the money.\xe2\x80\x9d Nevertheless, he said, they \xe2\x80\x9cneed to take a big step toward economic and political union, whoever wants to be a part of it.\xe2\x80\x9d Germany \xe2\x80\x9cis right to hold out for systemic changes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Europeans hoped to have 30 to 40 years to integrate more fully. Right now they don\xe2\x80\x99t have 30 to 40 weeks.\xe2\x80\x9dSome say they have far less than that.\xe2\x80\x9cWe are now entering the critical period of 10 days to complete and conclude the crisis response of the European Union,\xe2\x80\x9d said the bloc\xe2\x80\x99s economics commissioner, Olli Rehn, on Wednesday.France and Germany are concentrating their efforts on a fundamental shift in powers among the 17 European Union states that use the euro, seeking to amend the bloc\xe2\x80\x99s treaties to allow more centralized oversight of national fiscal and budget policies, and more centralized interference in them, too.

And that's the cold hard fact that investors need to recognize; volatility will never end and it is a permanent part of the investment landscape. So how do you invest in this new environment? Having a perspective on macro events is an important foundational step. We continue to watch developments in Europe as well as the economy in the United States and China. And based on our observations, we are investing portfolios for our clients that reflect our economic and market views. The rally this week is real. The sustainability of the slope is not. will zigzag and one needs to be tactical in this environment. So given current conditions, here's how we are investing: Europe: Europe is cheap and might pay off if you guess correctly which asset to buy. For us, though, there is just way too much drama for us in the euro zone. We're not buying Europe. United States: As tough as it is for the gloomy prognosticators to swallow, conditions are improving in America. Yes, we have huge deficits and high unemployment. But despite these ills, the United States economy is still fundamentally stronger than most. Why is it when the world is afraid, they buy gold and US treasuries? It's because the world knows the U.S. isn't collapsing. We're buying dividend stocks like Johnson & Johnson , technology companies like QUALCOMM and Apple , and retailers like Costco and Amazon . Tailwind industries such as technology and trade down retailers are great places to allocate capital even after this week's market rally. In the United States, we believe the trading range for equities to be between 10,500 and 12,500 for the Dow. We tend to be more cautious in investing equity assets closer to the upper threshold. When you allocate your capital keep this range in mind as it will provide a guide for how quickly to move money into the market. Latin America: Investing in Latin America is a bet on the emergence of a larger middle class. Commodity production will continue to fuel economic growth and we believe countries like Brazil are well positioned to participate in this trend. Japan: Too many problems. A falling birthrate, increasing average age, a strong yen, and problems in the banking system make this country unattractive to us. We are avoiding Japan. Asia (except for Japan): In general, we like the region's growth prospects though we believe it is critical not to become overly enthusiastic when strategist pound the table that the future is in Asia. There is no doubt Asia will continue to be a strong growth engine for the global economy. Still, understand that markets often move differently than economies and ; expectations drive market performance. Be cautious and selective when you invest. Markets and economies can diverge and often do. Asia is no exception. We like Singapore, Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia. These 4 countries each have different profiles that help you capture different sectors. In Singapore you participate in global finance and trade. Korea provides the opportunity to participate in a strong consumer market as well as electronics exports. Malaysia is a country rich in energy resources. Indonesia, with its commodity assets, continues to move forward towards establishing a more robust middle class. Commodities: The correction in commodities is an opportunity. Food commodities and industrial metals will advance as inflation picks up and global growth restarts. Gold:Never underestimate the power of fear; emotion will drive the price of gold higher. India and China will continue to increase their consumption of gold for ornamental uses. And central banks will continue to have doubts about the solvency of the United States/Europe and diversify currency reserves to gold holdings. Fixed income: We are mostly in short duration corporate fixed income. We are of the belief that there is a Treasury bubble and we are avoiding longer maturities on the expectation that inflation will ramp up. Considering the massive influx of phantom dollars by governments and central banks, it seems likely that the seeds of inflation have already been sown. That's our map. Of course it's more complex than this on an operational basis but these are the general themes we are pursuing. What's important for you as an investor is to understand what themes matter to you. Invest based on changing conditions and tactically adjust; that's what's necessary in today's very volatile market.

But both lenders he was negotiating with demanded that Mr. Kumar put up equity in his own home as collateral. Mr. Kumar hesitated, and then as 2008 wore on, he watched the value of his home fall to $330,000 from $425,000, wiping out all of his equity. Eventually, the banks broke off negotiations. With no cash on hand and revenue down by some 60 percent during the first half of 2009, Mr. Kumar closed Precision Steel in July 2009. Today, he runs an investment advice Web site, Value Stock Guide. The collapse of the housing market has highlighted how entrepreneurs are routinely compelled to bet the house on their businesses. For many, taking the risk is tempting because their home may be their largest asset and loans against home equity are easier to find than business loans. Also, such loans come at lower interest rates than most alternatives. They can also allow a business owner to avoid giving equity to investors.

1338,Morici: Euro is a Cruel Hoax on Mediterranean Nations ,The Guest Blog,01-12-2011,"Federal Reserve assistance to shore up Europe's sagging banks may be good geo-politics but it is bad economics.Only abandoning the euro, not printing money and Teutonic austerity, will fix Europe's banks and economies. When introduced in December 1998, the exchange rate for the euro against the dollar was set at the average of values for the currencies it replaced and then left to float-find its value through supply and demand in foreign currency markets. Although EU treaties and bureaucracy did much to harmonize regulatory and social policies across the continent, EU governments remain sovereign. The quality of economic policy, pace of productivity growth and competitiveness evolved differently across euro economies. Over time, the euro became undervalued for Germany and other northern states-and their exports became artificially cheap-and overvalued for Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain-and their products artificially expensive. The northern states became export juggernauts at the expense of Mediterranean states, who endured chronic trade deficits. Either trade deficits are financed by inflows of private investment or borrowing abroad-private companies from Germany and other northern states building factories with the euro earned exporting south, or Mediterranean economies borrowing. The investments never came-at least not in adequate size. For one thing, the largest of the northern juggernauts, Germany publicly exhorts its industrial prowess but privately manipulates domestic industrial policies to keep the lion share of its manufacturing employment at home or selectively in Eastern European states that fit its foreign policy. Public ownership in major industrial enterprises and banks, and union participation on boards of directors help enforce this quiet but effective mercantilism and is deeply rooted in German history. German bragging about economic reforms and engineering genius is a great public hoax. German productivity simply does not justify a 31 hour work week, and its export is firmly rooted in an undervalued currency, virulent state-capitalism and protectionism. Southern Europeans, much like Americans during the heady days of the last decade, borrowed too much. Privately, they borrowed to finance homes and credit cards from banks in Germany, France and foreign countries. Publicly, their governments sold bonds to foreign banks to shore up social programs-not much different in their scope and generosity from the rest of Europe-and to paper over high private sector unemployment that is endemic in economies with overvalued currencies. The solution being offered by Germany and other northern states are direct loans to the Mediterranean governments, forgiveness of public debt held by private banks and other private creditors, slashing public spending, and driving unemployment above 15 or 20 percent to push down wages and make their economies more competitive. The theory is they will attract more foreign investment if their workers are paid less. Germany, Holland and others are not about to let their industrial giants move factories and jobs south, give up their large trade surpluses, and the pretense that their gold plated job security guarantees and social benefits result in super-human competitiveness-something their Anglo-Saxon brethren could never accomplish. Hence, the Mediterranean states will never have the exports and earn the euro to pay what they owe. Essentially, European banks have two kinds of loans on their books-dollar denominated debt, much of which is backed up by mortgages and loans to Americans and corporations who need dollars to engage in U.S. and global commerce. And euro-denominated sovereign debt and the loans to ordinary citizens, who face financial stress in economies enduring recessions hastened and exacerbated by the austerity demanded by Germany. The Federal Reserve  is lending the European Central Banks , who in turn lends those funds to euro-country banks against their dollar-denominated loans. It doesn't fix the problem that those banks hold too much euro-denominated debt-Mediterranean states bonds and private loans-that will ultimately fail. The only sane option is for the Mediterranean states to reform their social policies to promote more flexible labor markets and attract private investment, drop the euro, remark public and private debt to the reestablished national currencies, and let falling values for those currencies in foreign exchange markets impose haircuts on creditors. Devaluation would permit the failing economies to increase exports and repay more of what they owe. The losses imposed on private creditors by devaluation would be much less than the losses they endured if the EU continues the myth the euro is essential to European unity. Sadly, the economic maelstrom now imposed on Europe by the architects of German mercantilism may destroy any political will to continue the EU when the euro is finally abandoned.

1348,Markets pause for Quiet Consolidation Post Wild Wednesday Trade,Currency Contest,01-12-2011,"Markets have mostly been locked in some consolidation following the massive surge in risk appetite on the back of Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s coordinated central bank action, and it now remains to be seen whether this recovery rally can be sustained. We contend that the rally will not be sustainable, and ultimately, we should once again see a resumption of risk liquidation, with currencies and equities under pressure and the US Dollar as the primary beneficiary. Look for EUR/USD to hold below 1.3500 on a daily close basis.The central bank actions on Wednesday only reinforce the severity of the global crisis and while necessary, should certainly not be taken as a risk positive. It is true that the actions of the central banks will make money cheaper and attempt to stimulate the global economy, but let us not forget that cheap money means nothing if it is still not accessible. This has been a major critique of these alternative forms of monetary policy measures, and at the end of the day, there are still serious risks of a liquidity trap.The Australian Dollar which outperformed on the Wednesday risk correlated flows is a gross underperformer on Thursday thus far with some softer retail sales, atrocious building approvals, and disappointing China manufacturing PMIs all factoring into the price action. This all but solidifies an additional 25bp rate cut at next week\xe2\x80\x99s RBA meeting, and we continue to project relative underperformance in the Australian Dollar over the coming weeks and months. Unfortunately, our short position from this week was stopped yesterday at 1.0280, but we still hold onto our core short position from 1.0550.Data in European trade was mostly on the softer side with a batch of weaker PMI readings. However, there was a ray of light out of the UK as manufacturing PMIs there came out above forecast. Meanwhile, auction results on Thursday were well received, with both the Spanish and French results helping to support the Euro intraday. Fitch\xe2\x80\x99s Riley kept things balanced after saying that France could be at risk for a downgrade should the EMU debt crisis intensify. German EconMin Schaeuble was also on the wires reaffirming the country\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to the idea of Euro bonds.Looking ahead, US initial jobless claims, ISM manufacturing and construction spending highlight the North American calendar. But as per the usual, we suspect that broader macro themes and developments will influence trade. It will certainly be interesting to see if risk traders can build on the momentum from Wednesday trade. While we remain skeptical, we would not rule out this possibility. US equity futures are tracking moderately lower, while oil is also offered and gold trades flat. On the official circuit, Fed\xe2\x80\x99s Lockhart and Bullard are slated to speak, followed by IMG Lagarde, EU Van Rompuy and EU Barnier.

Cramer changed his mind after reading the research from Bernstein, which upgraded RIM to \xe2\x80\x98market-perform\xe2\x80\x99 from \xe2\x80\x98underperform\xe2\x80\x99 on Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 He thinks the analyst, Pierre Ferragu, has been right every step of the way on RIM , from the time he initiated coverage in October of 2009 with a sell rating to his recent upgrade. Ferragu doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think the fundamentals have gotten any better, Cramer said, but at this point all the negatives have been baked into the stock price. Plus, RIM has become so cheap, the analyst thinks the downside has become minimal. It is also possible an activist shareholder could push for a \xe2\x80\x9cmuch needed\xe2\x80\x9d change in management. Or the company could be taken over by someone like HTC or Microsoft .Bernstein doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think a takeover is likely, Cramer said, but the possibility is enough to make shorting the stock way too risky at these levels.\xe2\x80\x9cThe Bernstein analyst is right: RIM did get cheaper as it went down,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has nearly $3 of cash per share on the balance sheet, a huge installed base of customers, and a lot of valuable intellectual property.\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer's bottom line: While RIM is not a buy right now, it is no longer a sell.""I fear someone will rattle the cage and move it up, or that some company might be stupid enough to buy them,"" he said.

1380,Technicals Say Go With the Money and Not the Brains,Currency Contest,02-12-2011,"Markets have lain dormant since Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s coordinated central bank action, and traders are still befuddled as to why. On one hand, the move opens the door to cheaper money and should theoretically help stimulate the global economy. However, the move also underscores a bleak outlook \xe2\x80\x93 the global economy wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t need aggressive resuscitation measures if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in terrible shape. Also, as we mentioned on Wednesday, monetary cheapness doesn\xe2\x80\x99t equal availability. Banks are still balking from lending, causing a liquidity trap which could potentially expose the global economy to danger up the road.Market participants are struggling to decide whether they want to build back into risk correlated assets, or run for the hills. As a techno-fundamental strategist, I myself am torn with the markets rights now. Fundamentally, I remain extremely bearish, with the recent central bank actions only solidifying my view that the Eurozone contagion has spread well beyond the Eurozone, and that this is simply phase two of a global recession which originated in the United States back in 2008.From here, risks are for a more aggressive deterioration in the east, with China seen as the antagonist in phase three. Phase three should expose markets which have been traditionally invested in as risk correlated assets but in recent months have seen an active flow on safe haven flows away from the exposed United States and Eurozone economies. But these markets are not safe-haven markets, and we contend that we will soon see an enormous liquidation from investments in these markets as investors realize that these regions are just as exposed. As such, a slowdown in China will infect the correlated Australian economy and other commodity bloc economies as well as many of the emerging markets.At the start of the crisis, there was an absurd decoupling theory which asserted that the Unites States recession would be contained and that the rest of the world would be fine. This view translated into a flow of funds into the Eurozone and we now see the result of that trade. So why should it be any different with China, the commodity bloc and emerging market economies? Here too we should soon see that the world is in fact very connected and the effects of the crisis are yet to be felt in these markets. Some would analogize to a ripple effect, but we prefer to liken the current global recession to a snowball that builds in size and momentum as it makes it way down the mountain. The Eurozone crisis is looking like more of a disaster than in the US, and we wonder just how much further down the mountain China is?Technically, the market seems to be offering a more open minded and clear picture. As hard as it is to turn away from the doom and gloom fundamental outlook, the technical picture is not ruling out the possibility for some upside in risk correlated assets over the coming sessions. The Euro looks like it is attempting to carve out another base after stalling ahead of critical support by 1.3145 and it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t at all be surprising to see a rally back towards the 1.3800 area before the potential for bearish resumption. The key level to watch above comes in at 1.3535, and a daily close above could very well accelerate gains towards 1.3800.The month of December is difficult enough to trade as it is, and throw in the current backdrop and things become all the more difficult to predict in the short-term. As such, the best place to be seems to be the only logical place to be right now, which is on the sidelines. We will happily take a backseat and wait to see how things play out over the coming days. If the Euro and currencies continue to correct higher, we will wait for an opportunity to look to re-assert our core bearish strategy, if the markets stall out and roll back over, we will look for opportunity to sell on downside breaks.

1402,Learning Too Late of Perils in Gas Well Leases,Energy,02-12-2011,"After Scott Ely and his father talked with salesmen from an energy company about signing the lease allowing gas drillingon their land in northeastern Pennsylvania, he said he felt certain it required the company to leave the property as good as new.So Mr. Ely said he was surprised several years later when the drilling company, Cabot Oil and Gas , informed them that rather than draining and hauling away the toxic drilling sludge stored in large waste ponds on the property, it would leave the waste, cover it with dirt and seed the area with grass. He knew that waste pond liners can leak, seeping contaminated waste. \xe2\x80\x9cI guess our terms should have been clearer\xe2\x80\x9d about requiring the company to remove the waste pits after drilling, said Mr. Ely, of Dimock, Pa., who sued Cabot after his drinking water from a separate property was contaminated. \xe2\x80\x9cWe learned that the hard way.\xe2\x80\x9d Americans have signed millions of leases allowing companies to drill for oil and natural gas on their land in recent years. But some of these landowners \xe2\x80\x94 often in rural areas, and eager for quick payouts \xe2\x80\x94 are finding out too late what is, and what is not, in the fine print. Energy company officials say that standard leases include language that protects landowners. But a review of more than 111,000 leases, addenda and related documents by The New York Times suggests otherwise: Fewer than half the leases require companies to compensate landowners for water contamination after drilling begins. And only about half the documents have language that lawyers suggest should be included to require payment for damages to livestock or crops. Most leases grant gas companies broad rights to decide where they can cut down trees, store chemicals, build roads and drill. Companies are also permitted to operate generators and spotlights through the night near homes during drilling. In the leases, drilling companies rarely describe to landowners the potential environmental and other risks that federal laws require them to disclose in filings to investors. Most leases are for three or five years, but at least two-thirds of those reviewed by The Times allow extensions without additional approval from landowners. If landowners have second thoughts about drilling on their land or want to negotiate for more money, they may be out of luck. The leases \xe2\x80\x94 obtained through open records requests \xe2\x80\x94 are mostly from gas-rich areas in Texas, but also in Maryland, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. In Pennsylvania, Colorado and West Virginia, some landowners have had to spend hundreds of dollars a month to buy bottled water or maintain large tanks, known as water buffaloes, for drinking water in their front yards. They said they learned only after the fact that the leases did not require gas companies to pay for replacement drinking water if their wells were contaminated, and despite state regulations, not all costs were covered. Thousands of landowners in Virginia, Pennsylvania and Texas have joined class action lawsuits claiming that they were paid less than they expected because gas companies deducted costs like hauling chemicals to the well site or transporting the gas to market. Some industry officials saythe criticism of their business practices is misguided. Asked about the waste pits on Mr. Ely\xe2\x80\x99s land in Pennsylvania, for example, George Stark, a Cabot spokesman, said the company\xe2\x80\x99s cleanup measures met or exceeded state requirements. And the door-to-door salesmen, commonly known as landmen, who pitch the leases on behalf of the drilling companies also dismiss similar complaints from landowners, and say they do not mislead anyone. The Sales Pitch \xe2\x80\x9cThere are bad leases out there, and, as with any industry, there have also been some unscrupulous opportunists,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mike Knapp, president of Knapp Acquisitions and Production, a company in western Pennsylvania that brokers deals between landowners and drilling companies. \xe2\x80\x9cBut everyone I know who does this work is on the up and up, and most of the bad actors that there may have been before are no longer in business.\xe2\x80\x9d He said that his company\xe2\x80\x99s leases ensure that landowners will get replacement water. The company also encourages landowners to visit an existing drilling site before signing a lease to get an idea of the potential noise and truck traffic. Some of the complaints about leases, he said, are just sour grapes from landowners who are envious about the amount of money they believe their neighbors are earning in bonuses and royalties. To be sure, many landowners have earned small fortunes from drilling leases. Last year, natural gas companies paid more than $1.6 billion in lease and bonus payments to Pennsylvania landowners, according to a report commissioned by the Marcellus Shale Coalition, an industry trade group. Chesapeake Energy , one of the largest natural gas companies, has paid more than $183.8 million in royalties in Texas this year, according to its Web site. Much of the money has gone to residents in rural areas where jobs are scarce and farmers and ranchers have struggled to stay afloat. Mr. Ely once worked for a company owned by Cabot on drilling sites in his area, until he was fired shortly after publicly complaining about Cabot\xe2\x80\x99s drilling practices. But many landowners and lawyers say that gas companies are intentionally vague in their contracts and use high-pressure sales tactics on landowners. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen a good lease, or any lease, how are you supposed to know what terms to try to get in yours?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ron Stamets, a drilling proponent and a Web site developer in Lakewood, Pa., who started a consumer protection Web site, PAGasLease.com, in 2008 so that he could swap advice with his neighbors as he prepared to sign a gas lease. Others have also taken steps to better inform landowners about the details in leases. In the past several years, the attorneys general in New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania have published advisories about the pitfalls of leasing land for drilling. State regulations also provide protections to landowners above and beyond what is in their leases. At least eight states specifically require companies to compensate landowners for damage to their properties or to negotiate with them about where wells will be drilled, even if the lease does not provide those protections. Asked about the leases, officials from Exxon Mobil, the largest natural gas producer in the United States, declined to comment.

1403,Cramer: Comverse Tech Stock Worth Speculating On,Mad Money,02-12-2011,"Although U.S. stocks ended flat on Friday, all three major averages posted an impressive gain of more than 7 percent for the week.

1426,Democrats See an Advantage in Debate Over Payroll Tax,Politics,02-12-2011,"After struggling all year for an economic message that resonates broadly with Americans in hard times, President Obama and Congressional Democrats have settled on one they believe can carry through next year\xe2\x80\x99s election as they use a fight over payroll taxes to portray Republicans as defenders of the wealthy at the expense of the middle class.With Mr. Obama leading the charge in Washington and political swing states, Senate Democrats have put proudly antitax Republicans in the position of opposing a tax cut for more than 160 million mostly middle-class Americans because they object that it includes a tax on about 350,000 people, those with more than $1 million in annual taxable income.Votes late on Thursday left the issue at an impasse. The Senate voted 51 to 49 for Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 measure to further reduce Social Security payroll taxes next year for both workers and employers and to impose the surtax, but the tally was short of the 60 votes needed. One moderate Republican, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, supported it. A Republican alternative, which would have extended the current more modest tax cut and slashed the federal payroll to pay for it, was rejected 78 to 20, with more than half of Republicans opposed.The maneuvering suggests that the parties will agree to some continued relief before the current payroll tax cut expires on Dec. 31. But how much of a cut and how \xe2\x80\x94 or if \xe2\x80\x94 it will be paid for remain to be settled, with some in both parties saying that the tax break would further weaken the Social Security system\xe2\x80\x99s financing.But politically, Democrats believe that they have already won this latest skirmish in the message wars. And some exasperated Republicans acknowledge that they are losing the exchange; party leaders have worked this week to bring the rank and file in line behind the tax cut.Democrats have concluded from the payroll tax debate that Republicans are vulnerable over their opposition to any new taxes on the wealthy in a way they were not when Democrats proposed such taxes for deficit reduction. So they have reprised an old message \xe2\x80\x94 that Democrats fight for the middle class, Republicans for the rich \xe2\x80\x94 and are likely to sound it through 2012, in hopes of blunting the headwinds they face as unemployment remains high.\xe2\x80\x9cTonight, Senate Republicans chose to raise taxes on nearly 160 million hard-working Americans because they refused to ask a few hundred thousand millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama said in a statement after the first Senate vote.It was the same message he delivered on Wednesday, in anticipation of the Senate action, both in speeches to a crowd in blue-collar Scranton, Pa., and later to affluent donors in New York. In Scranton, speaking as if to Republicans, he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cAre you willing to fight as hard for middle-class families as you do for those who are most fortunate?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s it going to be?\xe2\x80\x9dMr. Obama, in setting this debate in motion in September, when he introduced his job-creation plan, has tapped into the widespread sense of income inequality \xe2\x80\x94 fighting for \xe2\x80\x9cthe 99 percent\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 that gave rise to the Occupy Wall Street movement. But Democrats would not be in their current strong position but for the fact that Republicans, for the first time in memory, contested a tax cut and then insisted that the reductions be paid for.\xe2\x80\x9cThis would have been unheard of even six months ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we are changing the debate, and the public is with us.\xe2\x80\x9dMr. Schumer read to reporters from RedState.com, a Web site popular among conservatives, where a blogger, Erick Erickson, wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cI never thought I would see the day, but Democrats are outmaneuvering Republicans on a tax cut.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cLike clockwork, the G.O.P. is throwing the ball into the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 basket for them,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Erickson said.Republican leaders\xe2\x80\x99 struggle this week to find a strategy that could unite their party reflected the political bind it is in. Nearly 7 in 10 Americans said the policies of Republicans in Congress favored the rich, a New York Times/CBS News poll found in October.In a memo to Senate Democrats last week, the party pollster Geoff Garin cited other recent surveys to argue that concern about income inequality and the perceived decline of the middle class is trumping the antigovernment fervor that defined last year\xe2\x80\x99s Congressional midterm election and allowed Republicans to take control of the House. He said that sets up a 2012 election that is fundamentally different.",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/02/democrats-see-an-advantage-in-debate-over-payroll-tax.html
1427,5 Holiday Stock Picks Sure to Please Investors,CNBC Stock Blog,02-12-2011,"Most retailers' November sales exceeded analysts' estimates, helped by the Black Friday weekend, which accounts for as much as a quarter of the month's total.That weekend kicked off the holiday season with sales jumping 16 percent, according to the National Retail Federation. Cyber Monday extended those gains as online sales soared 22 percent.The dip in the stock market has created a buying opportunity, as investors may be more pessimistic than they should be. History also shows that equities may generate gains this month. Below are five companies that are benefiting from a strong holiday season.1. AmazonNot only is online shopping earning a greater share of consumers' wallet, Amazon  has a deadly weapon this year: the Kindle Fire. Priced at $199, it's cheaper than Apple's iPad, and appeals to the value-oriented consumer.With high unemployment and depressed wages, more Americans are shopping for cheaper versions of almost everything these days.Amazon was a big winner on Black Friday, saying sales of its Kindle reader quadrupled from last year. The e-commerce giant also noted that its Kindle Fire tablet is still the most popular item on its Web site since its launch last month.Given such momentum, Amazon is set to beat analysts' sales estimates in the fourth quarter.Loyalty fostered by the Kindle and increased conversion to Prime membership, a service that provides free shipping for an annual fee, will help drive sales.Still, the stock isn't cheap \xe2\x80\x94 it trades at 60 times forward-year earnings estimates.But most analysts are expecting the stock to rise to at least $220, with some calling for $270. It's now at $197.2. TJX Cos.Americans trading down means off-price retailer TJX , which operates T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, is getting richer.The retailer posted a better-than-expected sales increase in November and showed an improvement in trends at its TJX Europe division, which is in the midst of a restructuring, for the second month in a row.While not a big player in the Black Friday frenzy, TJX's sales held up even though unseasonably warm weather hurt its rivals. That bodes well for December sales trends, especially for gift items.Despite hitting a new high yesterday, the stock still only trades at 13 times forward earnings estimates. Earnings are expected to grow 14 percent to 15 percent next year.3. Macy'sMacy's  has been gaining market share with the success of its My Macy's, which matches merchandise to local tastes. Black Friday weekend was very strong for the department store, helping November sales beat analysts' estimates.Apparel sales have been weak so far this year, but the company has shown strength in accessories, handbags, shoes and menswear. When the cold weather returns, sales of coats, gloves other winter categories will follow, boosting sales over the next few months.AccuWeather.com is expecting a cold and snowy winter in the Midwest and Northeast, the two regions where Macy's has most of its stores.Macy's stock has had a nice run this year, up 21 percent, but only trades at a multiple of 10 times next year's earnings. As a market-share gainer, with robust online sales, and the added benefit of luxury retailer Bloomingdale's, Macy's is poised to beat earnings forecasts in the fourth quarter.Macy's isn't only one of America's favorite holiday shopping destinations, it's also a great holiday stock pick.4. AppleApple  has what seems to be an endless line of consumers willing to buy its products, with iPhones, iPads and MacBook Airs among the top items on many Christmas wish lists.Deutsche Bank conducted a study over Black Friday that pointed to robust demand for all three items, and Piper Jaffray said Apple stores sold 68% more iPads per hour compared with the same period last year.Apple has indicated that it expects to set a new record for iPad shipments in the December quarter, helped by very strong sales overseas.Notably, this is a period that also benefits from an extra week (14 weeks versus the usual 13).What's more, IBM CoreMetrics said 14.3 percent of all shopping on Black Friday was done on a mobile device, with Apple leading the way.The iPhone was the No. 1 device used and the iPad was No. 2.Investors have been concerned that the passing of Steve Jobs, a third-quarter earnings miss and a big run in the stock this year limits more gains in the stock.Regardless, Apple should have a successful holiday, and revenue and profit will follow.5. Coach Luxury retailers are expected to fare well this holiday season. Wealthy customers haven't stopped shopping all year, while the less-affluent have been more cautious on discretionary spending.November sales at Saks and Nordstrom exceeded analysts' estimates. That bodes well for other high-end retailers.Coach  has had solid sales momentum, which will continue through the holiday season with the frequent delivery of new products to stores and increased marketing.Morgan Stanley says a focus on gift items and smaller impulse items such as wristlets will buoy sales unlike in other years.______________________________\xc2\xa0 CNBC Data Pages:Dow 30 Stocks\xe2\x80\x94In Real Time Oil, Gold, Natural Gas Prices Now Where's the US Dollar Today?______________________________ Disclosures:TheStreet's editorial policy prohibits staff editors, reporters and analysts from holding positions in any individual stocks.Disclaimer",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/02/5-holiday-stock-picks-sure-to-please-investors.html
1428,How to Trade on the European Union Summit,Money in Motion,02-12-2011,"Expectations are high for the upcoming European Union summit. Here's how to trade if reality falls short.Ready for the European Union summit? ""The expectations are through the roof"" for meaningful results, says Andrew Busch, global currency and public policy strategist for BMO Capital. That could spell trouble, he says. ""They've got to come up with a fiscal plan that integrates Europe,"" he told CNBC's Simon Hobbs. ""There's a lot of work that has to be done on this thing. Bottom line, they'll probably be disappointed by the end of the week.""Rebecca Patterson, chief markets strategist for J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Institutional, is equally wary. ""I think Germany and France alone to agree is going to be a big challenge, much less getting Finland and the Netherlands and Austria to agree,"" she says. ""I do think there's a big risk of disappointment.""Patterson sees a trading opportunity on the likelihood of disappointment - just not with the euro. ""If Europe disappoints, the global economy gets nervous, and risk appetite is off,"" she says. So she wants to sell the New Zealand dollar and buy the U.S. dollar.  With New Zealand's high current account deficit, it is reliant on foreign capital, and in an uncertain environment when risk appetite fades, , that makes it vulnerable. Patterson recommends selling the kiwi against the dollar at 0.7900 and look for a move to 0.7500 with a stop at 0.8100.",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/02/how-to-trade-on-the-european-union-summit.html
1429,"European Leaders Look to I.M.F. for Assistance, Again, as Euro Crisis Lingers ",Europe News,03-12-2011,"European leaders are looking outside the Continent for help solving the longstanding crisis over the euro, but while the International Monetary Fund maybe able to help, it will not be the magic wand they seek.The fund may be asked to assist further as leaders of the 17 European Union nations that use the euro meet to prepare for a summit meeting on Thursday and Friday. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France are scheduled to hold talks in Paris on Monday, and, at the request of President Obama, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner is meeting with European leaders later in the week. European Union leaders have already turned to the I.M.F. to assist smaller nations like Ireland, Greece and Portugal. In all three, the fund is providing about a third of the necessary loans and its expertise in guiding countries with solvency problems back to recovery. Last month, at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Cannes, the fund was also asked to monitor the economic, fiscal and structural reforms in huge and shaky Italy \xe2\x80\x94 not as a lender, at least not yet, but rather to lend its skills and credibility to the efforts of the new prime minister, Mario Monti, a technocrat. The I.M.F. lacks the resources to create the much-discussed \xe2\x80\x9cfirewall\xe2\x80\x9d to keep interest rates at sustainable levels for troubled euro zone economies. Italy and Spain together have total debts of more than $3.3 trillion, with Italy about to roll over $276 billion in debt over in the next six months and Spain about $150 billion. Just those two rollovers would wipe out the amount the fund has available to lend worldwide, about $400 billion. European policy makers are looking to the fund to help ensure budgetary restraint while perhaps also serving as a vehicle for financing. The I.M.F. could raise or contribute its own money, or channel money from countries with surpluses, like China. A senior Treasury official said that the I.M.F. might provide \xe2\x80\x9cadditional, spare-tire capacity\xe2\x80\x9d by contributing some financing, but that Europe would primarily use its own resources to wrestle down interest rates and keep countries like Spain solvent. \xe2\x80\x9cEurope is rich enough. It is not in net deficit, when you balance out all of the trade deficits and surpluses,\xe2\x80\x9d says Raghuram Rajan, a professor at the University of Chicago and former chief economist at the I.M.F. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Europe needs right now is money that is willing to absorb losses \xe2\x80\x94 and the I.M.F. is not going to provide the money that absorbs losses.\xe2\x80\x9d Analysts say that Europe will need to provide the bulk of that money itself: through the European Central Bank ; the European bailout fund, called the European Financial Stability Facility ; or transfers from fiscally sound countries like Germany. Consideration of how to use I.M.F. resources and expertise started in earnest at the Cannes summit meeting in early November. Finance ministers were ordered to develop plans for \xe2\x80\x9cdeploying a range of various options\xe2\x80\x9d for the fund to help bring down borrowing costs. Some of the options appear to be more likely than others. One is a plan to have euro zone central banks lend money to the I.M.F. The fund could then provide lines of credit to countries struggling to finance their debts, and could participate in fiscal monitoring. That plan is gaining support in Europe. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is an easy solution because bilateral loans are coming from the central banks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herman Van Rompuy, the European Union president, on Thursday, according to Bloomberg News. \xe2\x80\x9cThey haven\xe2\x80\x99t to ask for money from the taxpayer.\xe2\x80\x9d A second plan under discussion would have the I.M.F. create new special drawing rights to grant to member countries. Countries hold the special drawing rights \xe2\x80\x94 an i.o.u. with a value based on a basket of major currencies \xe2\x80\x94 as reserves and can tap them in case of an emergency. The measure would be marginal and supplementary, given that the special drawing rights would be apportioned to members according to their contributions to the I.M.F. But by assuring investors that countries have the capacity to repay all loans, such additional special drawing rights could push down borrowing rates. American agreement is necessary to increase I.M.F. funds, and in private conversations Treasury officials have ruled out that measure for now. Further, Mr. Obama is considered highly unlikely to ask Congress for extra money to bail out Europe, especially in an election year. All the options under consideration are founded on the fund\xe2\x80\x99s reputation for helping countries, albeit sometimes painfully, return to fiscal health and manage short-term liquidity crises. The fund \xe2\x80\x9cbrings money to the table,\xe2\x80\x9d says Edwin M. Truman, a former Treasury official and now at the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it also brings credibility. The fund has been in the business of creating lending programs for decades. It has a reputation for being tough and unbiased.\xe2\x80\x9d Some watchers wonder why the I.M.F. should be involved in aiding such rich countries at all. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a European problem, and there is no strong rationale for I.M.F. lending,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simon Johnson, a former I.M.F. chief economist who also contributes to a New York Times blog, Economix. \xe2\x80\x9cEurope has lots of money and no balance of payments problem. The euro is a reserve currency. The Germans can do a lot themselves, and the Germans and the E.C.B. can do everything the I.M.F. can do.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no justification under the I.M.F.\xe2\x80\x99s articles for the I.M.F. to get involved in Italy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew Hilton, director of the Center for the Study of Financial Innovation, in London, and a longtime fund watcher. He added that less-wealthy fund members, like Brazil, Argentina, Russia and India, would have legitimate complaints about bailing out more wealthy countries. Still, further I.M.F. involvement seems very likely. In recent days, euro zone leaders have indicated support for a bolstered I.M.F. role in resolving the sovereign-debt crisis. Luc Frieden, Luxembourg\xe2\x80\x99s finance minister, said the European bailout fund and the central bank did not have the capacity to ease the crisis alone. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to do so together with the I.M.F. and with the E.C.B., within the framework of its independence,\xe2\x80\x9d he told reporters at a meeting of euro zone finance ministers.

1434,Victory for Putin\xe2\x80\x99s Party Looks Smaller Than Expected ,Europe News,04-12-2011," Russian voters streamed to the polls on Sunday in a parliamentary election that has shaped up as a referendum on the governing party and Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin as he prepares to return to the presidency next year. While there was little question that the party, United Russia, would win the most votes, given its huge structural advantages and weak opposition, the central question was how well it could continue to sell its message of stability to an increasingly weary electorate, now widely empowered by the Internet to gripe about the status quo. With the results still being counted, United Russia declared victory on Sunday evening. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile the 2010-2011 elections in the United Kingdom, Spain and Portugal saw the change of ruling parties, we can now say calmly that United Russia remains the ruling party, and I would to thank our voters for that,\xe2\x80\x9d Boris Gryzlov, the chairman of the party\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Council said. But two exit polls suggested that the party was on its way to losing far more seats than anticipated, potentially redrawing the political landscape, with voters expressing a louder-than-expected message of frustration. Mr. Putin along with President Dmitri A. Medvedev made a brief appearance at a subdued meeting at United Russia headquarters. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is an optimal result which reflects the real situation in the country,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Putin said, according to Reuters. \xe2\x80\x9cBased on this result we can guarantee stable development of our country.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Medvedev said, according to Reuters, that United Russia, which had previously held a two-thirds supermajority that allowed it to make changes to the Constitution without consulting the opposition, was prepared to forge alliances on the issues. Fatigue with United Russia has been building for years, and the election had been expected to reflect that feeling. And Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s announcement on Sept. 24 that he intended to swap places with Mr. Medvedev next year seemed to annoy voters. The party\xe2\x80\x99s support dipped, and the Kremlin had recently acknowledged that United Russia would almost certainly lose the supermajority. United Russia currently holds 315 seats in the 450-seat Duma, the lower house of Parliament, and the party had said it could lose as many as 75. While Mr. Putin is still expected to easily win a separate presidential election in March, a steep loss for his party on Sunday would reflect flagging support for him as well. Final results were expected on Monday. The party\xe2\x80\x99s supporters said that preserving the current system, with Mr. Putin in charge, was the only prudent course. Galina I. Popkova, 76, said she voted for United Russia to avoid political paralysis. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we need to allow one side to be stronger, so that we will move forward, even if that movement is slow,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, though she warned that the government needed to start showing results. \xe2\x80\x9cRussians, we are like bears, we are so patient,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut when our patience ends, then we begin to growl.\xe2\x80\x9d Darya I. Mychkina, 96, held a United Russia poster showing the faces of Mr. Putin and Mr. Medvedev. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you not vote for these beautiful men?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. But a growing minority of discontented voters voiced their dissatisfaction in numerous ways: voting for any party but United Russia, spoiling their ballots by scrawling political messages on them or boycotting the election.

1435,China to Prepare for Social Unrest,Asia-Pacific News,04-12-2011,"Beijing has underlined its concern that an economic slowdown could lead to social unrest in China, with the country\xe2\x80\x99s security chief urging local officials to do more to prepare for the \xe2\x80\x9cnegative effects of the market economy\xe2\x80\x9d.Zhou Yongkang, a member of the politburo, told provincial officials that they needed to find better methods of \xe2\x80\x9csocial management\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 a euphemism which can include everything from better internet censorship and strategic policing of violent unrest, to a better social safety net.\xe2\x80\x9cIt is an urgent task for us to think how to establish a social management system with Chinese characteristics to suit our socialist market economy,\xe2\x80\x9d he told a seminar on \xe2\x80\x9csocial management innovation\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cEspecially when facing the negative effects of the market economy, we still have not formed a complete mechanism for social management,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Mr Zhou also urged officials to limit spending on wasteful \xe2\x80\x9cvanity\xe2\x80\x9d projects that trigger public anger. His comments are the clearest sign yet that Beijing is worried that the global economic crisis could lead to serious domestic social unrest. Mr Zhou\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, published by the state-run Xinhua news agency on Saturday, came at the end of a week which saw evidence of a slowdown in Chinese manufacturing, an easing in credit policy to avert a sharper slowdown, and two outbreaks of violence. Recent months have seen a rise in unrest \xe2\x80\x93 apparently linked to economic grievances, including workers\xe2\x80\x99 fears about the economic dislocation caused by Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s long-term plan to move away from low-value manufacturing to more creative and innovative industries. Workers in Shanghai clashed last week with police at a Singaporean consumer electronics supplier during a strike over mass job losses due to a company relocation, the US-based group China Labor Watch said. Tension spilt over in the central Chinese city of Xian on Friday, with Xinhua reporting hundreds of people overturning police and government cars after officers took more than two hours to arrive at a scene where a girl had been killed by a building truck. Ordinary citizens often complain that the government does too little to protect them from safety risks like dangerous driving by such trucks. More than 10,000 workers in Shenzhen and Dongguan, two leading export centres in southern China, went on strike last month to protest against cuts in overtime \xe2\x80\x93 which they rely on to supplement meagre basic pay. The ruling Communist party relies on rapid economic growth as its main source of legitimacy and Chinese leaders assume that if the economy slows too much it will be unable to contain the resulting social unrest. Many analysts believe double-digit inflation and an economic slowdown were important contributors to the 1989 Tiananmen Square upheaval and resulting massacre. In the midst of the 2008 global financial crisis the government identified 8 per cent gross domestic product growth as the level necessary to avoid political chaos and mobilised the entire state sector in a successful effort to \xe2\x80\x9cprotect 8\xe2\x80\x9d.

1437,"Modest Bonus Year on Wall St., but Stock Could Yield Fortunes ",U.S. News,04-12-2011,"Buffeted by lackluster profits and turmoil in the global markets, Wall Street is bracing for one of the worst bonus seasons in recent memory. But in the alchemy of high finance, bankers are hoping to turn the slump to their advantage. Financial firms are preparing to dole out huge amounts of stock at depressed prices, the value of which could rise substantially in a few years. \xe2\x80\x9cThis year is the perfect situation where they can say it is a modest bonus season, but in the end, it could end up making many of them zillionaires,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jonathan R. Macey, a professor of corporate law and finance at Yale. \xe2\x80\x9dNot all banks may do well in the long run, but most will.\xe2\x80\x9d Even by Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s lofty standards, the compensation outlook this year is pretty bleak. Financial firms like Goldman Sachs , Bank of America and Citigroup are culling their ranks, and the remaining employees are resigning themselves to smaller year-end checks, at least in terms of the dollar amount. By some estimates, bonuses could shrink by as much as 30 percent this year. But a large portion of those payments will be in stock, rather than cash. Since the financial crisis, banks \xe2\x80\x94 which have faced withering criticism from lawmakers, investors and the public over their compensation practices \xe2\x80\x94 have been pushed by the government to hand out larger swaths of restricted stock and options, which allow an employee to buy shares down the road at a certain price. By linking personal compensation to long-term company performance, the hope is to curb the excessive risk-taking that nearly brought the financial system to the brink a few years ago. Top executives now receive the bulk of their bonuses in shares. In 2010, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd C. Blankfein, received 70 percent of his bonus in restricted stock, roughly $12.6 million. Bank of America awarded its head, Brian T. Moynihan, $9.05 million, entirely in equity. This year, the pattern is expected to persist, and some bankers are even lobbying for more stock and less cash in the mix, say several senior Wall Street executives responsible for setting compensation but not authorized to speak on the record. One senior bank executive says he comes in every day \xe2\x80\x9cpraying\xe2\x80\x9d the stock price of his firm doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go up before bonuses are handed out early next year. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is all anyone is thinking about,\xe2\x80\x9d the executive said, on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to reporters. With cash, employees receive a fixed amount. Stock, on the other hand, has the possibility of upside appreciation, albeit with downside risk. So $1 million of stock today could be worth $1.25 million or more next year \xe2\x80\x94 or the shares could be essentially worthless. Equity payouts from 2010 are underwater, in many cases. This year, bankers are predicting that the shares will rise significantly, or at least not fall much further. Bank stocks on average have dropped 40 percent since peaking in February, according to an index put together by the investment bank Keefe Bruyette & Woods. \xe2\x80\x9cInvestors have been betting with their wallets of late and avoiding buying the big brokers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Glenn Schorr, an analyst at Nomura. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if history is any guide these companies will adapt, improve their profitability and the prices will go up.\xe2\x80\x9d They have used the strategy in the past. With their shares in the doldrums at the depths of the financial crisis in 2008, several firms handed out unusually large amounts of stock to their employees. In 2009, JPMorgan gave out 131 million shares of restricted stock, with an average price of less than $20 each. As the stock rose the following year, the company paid out 80 million shares, with an average price of almost $43 a share. On Friday, it closed at $32.33. Goldman granted 36 million options in December 2008, more than 10 times the amount the year before. Afterward, employee stock grants accumulated over time represented 20.3 percent of the total shares outstanding, up from 7.3 percent before the issuance, according to an analysis by Footnoted, a division of Morningstar that scrutinizes corporate disclosures. It has the potential to be a windfall for Goldman employees. At the time of the grant, the stock was trading at nearly $79. When some of the options began to vest a year later, shares of Goldman had more than doubled in value. While the stock has since pulled back, it still stands at around $97, roughly $20 higher than three years ago. These stock grants can not be sold until 2014. Goldman declined to comment. Stock grants aren\xe2\x80\x99t always a boon. In December 2008, Morgan Stanley , which declined to comment, handed out 28 million shares, with an average value of $16.81. But those grants aren\xe2\x80\x99t looking so good today. The stock is now trading at roughly $15.50. Taking shares is still a gamble some bankers are willing to make. While a bank\xe2\x80\x99s stock could continue to suffer amid the economic malaise and regulatory uncertainty, the odds are in the bankers\xe2\x80\x99 favor. Following periods of prolonged weakness, financial companies typically experience a large price spike the next year. After the recession ended in 2003, the Keefe Bruyette & Woods index of bank stocks rose more than 40 percent. \xe2\x80\x9cThese stock grants have the potential to look a whole lot better three years from now than they do today,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Schorr, of Nomura, said.

1452,Morici: Reforms to Save Euro a Tall Order\xe2\x80\x94Even for Germany ,The Guest Blog,05-12-2011,"Now that the euro has bankrupted Greece and pushed Italy and other Mediterranean states to the brink, Angela Merkel proposes tough, EU-administered disciplines on national deficits. Those would thrust the Mediterranean states into decade-long recessions without fixing flaws in the Eurozone architecture that caused all the borrowing and crushing debt in the first place. At the end of 1998, wages, prices and government bonds were converted from national currencies into euro according to prevailing exchange rates. To the extent those rates reflected market prices, the euro adequately priced labor, exports and public debt across borders. Unfortunately, among the 17 members of the currency union, labor market policies, social programs, and industrial policies are separately established and financed, and vary much more than among the 50 states in the dollar zone. Specifically, union and worker protection rules are federally enforced in the United States, the 50 states don\xe2\x80\x99t own big chunks of industrial enterprises, as do German Landers, to build exports and block outsourcing, and Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid are federally financed. Owing to significant differences in labor-market and industrial policies, investment and productivity grew more rapidly in Germany and other strong northern economies, and labor and exports became overpriced in Italy and other now troubled southern economies. Generally, the European Central Bank permitted the euro to float, and its value against the dollar yen tends to reflect wages, productivity and economic strength of the 17 Eurozone countries as a whole. Consequently, the euro is undervalued for the German and other northern economies, making them export juggernauts, and woefully overvalued for Italy and other Mediterranean states, imposing on them chronic trade deficits. In the South, imports chronically exceeding exports created huge holes in demand for domestic goods and labor, and deprived national governments of tax revenues. Huge budget deficits became endemic to prop up employment and finance social programs. The terrible debt now burdening the balance sheets of Mediterranean states is the direct result of flaws in the architecture of the Eurozone\xe2\x80\x94the absence of unified labor market regulations, genuine limits on mercantilist industrial policies, and a fiscal regime to finance benefits for seniors, health care, unemployment insurance and the like. Chancellor Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s disciplines on member country budgets won\xe2\x80\x99t fix those imperfections. Recently, I discussed these issues with Peter Altmaier, chief whip of the Christian Democratic Union. He advises that Italy and others adopt German reforms. That\xe2\x80\x99s puzzling. Germany\xe2\x80\x99s economic strategy is substantially based on an undervalued currency, institutional constraints on outsourcing and amassing huge trade surpluses. As one country\xe2\x80\x99s trade surplus must be another country\xe2\x80\x99s trade deficit, not all European states can simultaneously accomplish Germany\xe2\x80\x99s mercantilist alchemy and resulting growth. Austerity and EU supervision of member country finances won\xe2\x80\x99t make troubled states more competitive, but it will leave them woefully uncompetitive and unable to finance health care and pensions, even at levels below those acceptable to most Germans. And, those policies won\xe2\x80\x99t enable troubled governments to pay their debts. As things stand, labor and exports are overpriced across the Mediterranean states, and their economies must endure tortuous recessions, lasting a decade or more, to push down wages to competitive levels\xe2\x80\x94but such deflation may not be enough. Draconian austerity would leave those economies with insufficient public infrastructure and outdated private capital, and no matter how much wages fell, those handicaps would keep productivity too low for exports to be competitive. To pay foreign debts, Mediterranean states must earn euro by exporting more than importing, and they must accomplish budget surpluses. However, such feats would require Germany and other northern countries to endure trade and budget deficits\xe2\x80\x94Germany and others are not likely to come to recognize that requirement easily or happily. What Merkel prescribeswould institutionalize German economic dominance\xe2\x80\x94Germany and other northern states get the exports and Italy and other southern states get the imports, the former makes loans to the latter to paper over the imbalance, and in the end, Germany, as the principal creditor state, controls the EU Commission and debtor states, just as Berlin now calls the shots at the ECB. To make the euro work, austerity and budget disciplines on southern countries must be complemented by EU-wide regulation of labor markets, genuine disciplines on beggar-thy-neighbor industrial policies and a substantial EU wide value-added tax\xe2\x80\x94matched by comparable reductions in national levies\xe2\x80\x94to finance a Eurozone-wide Social Security and health care systems. That\xe2\x80\x99s a tall order, but without those reforms, a single currency is more than Europeans can expect.

But since many stocks in the oil complex are trading as though the price of crude will fall back to $80 any day now, there are many bargains out there for savvy investors. One of those bargains is Fluor, Cramer said.\xe2\x80\x9c[It's] a terrific way to play this new era ... of persistently high oil  prices,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.The engineering and construction company  builds new oil and gas facilities, constructs new power plants and refurbishes aging infrastructure for oil and gas companies. Cramer considers it an oil play because 60 percent of its capital projects are oil and gas related. \xe2\x80\x9cReputation is everything,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand Fluor is known for providing exceptional services and technological know-how across every phase of every contract.\xe2\x80\x9dPlus, the company has a $43 million backlog, and Cramer thinks how much business a company has in its pipeline is the best way to gauge the strength of the business.

So what's right, Cramer asked, the morning's rally or the afternoon's pullback?Stocks have tied their fortunes to a hoped-for resolution of the European debt crisis. Optimistic investors bought shares in the morning after French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Germany and France had come to an agreement on tighter fiscal controls for the euro zone, to be voted on Friday. But reports of potential downgrades for every euro-zone nation hit markets hard by late afternoon, erasing part of the day's gains.Two weeks ago, the markets appeared on the eve of destruction, but Cramer noted the market is now in a better mood. Attitudes changed after the world\xe2\x80\x99s central banks agreed upon action that would avoid sizable bankruptcies and ease the strain of the economic crisis. Meanwhile, China cut rates and when the Chinese government wants its economy to grow, Cramer said it takes the world with it. Despite this, Cramer noted there are still a lot of challenges out there, including and especially regarding Europe\xe2\x80\x99s debt woes. If Europe is back on a growth path, that\xe2\x80\x99s welcome news, but investors should curb their enthusiasm because there will likely be bumps along the way. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we came in last Monday looking like it was the end of the world, we didn't expect any good news and we got a ton of it,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer explained. \xe2\x80\x9cThat's what caused this magnificent rally.\xe2\x80\x9cBut when we came in today, we were thinking that this is the beginning of a new, more positive era, with nothing but good news about to come our way. Yet the FXE, the ETF that measures the strength of the euro, the key barometer I look at to measure how good things really are, actually slipped today.\xe2\x80\x9dBottom line: Cramer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like markets that are overly optimistic, so he recommends investors remain vigilant and wait for a price break before buying anything more. \xe2\x80\x94Reuters contributed to this reportCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

1488,Blog: Iran Threatens Oil Prices - What Would $250 a Barrel Really Mean?,The Guest Blog,05-12-2011,"On Sunday, Iran warnedthat any move to block its oil exports would more than double crude oil prices. That would certainly have devastating consequences on a world economy and the major advanced economies, which are already shifting to recession territory.\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as such an issue is raised seriously the oil price would soar to above $250 a barrel,\xe2\x80\x9d Ramin Mehmanparast, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in an interview for Asharq Al-Awsat. A day later, New York Timesreported that a recent explosion at a military base near Tehran was a major setback for Iran\xe2\x80\x99s most advanced long-range missile program. Global recovery could certainly live without (still another) crisis, especially in Iran, the world's fifth biggest exporter. What would $250 mean? In the past, Washington and Brussels have been reluctant to target Iran\xe2\x80\x99s central bank or oil exports for fear of driving up oil prices. Despite strong oil prices, sanctions have weakened the spending power of the Ahmadinejad government. The expected phasing out of fuel subsidies has gone relatively smoothly, but it is contributing to inflation, which is said to exceed 20% (Iran\xe2\x80\x99s central bank no longer releases the data). Iran is increasing its domestic refining capacity, but a possible cut off of refined fuel imports would deal a heavy blow to the economy \xe2\x80\x93 as would Teheran\xe2\x80\x99s own more aggressive regional stance. The showdown between Iran and the West serves to highlight the fact that, after the global crisis will fade into history, difficult problems loom ahead. At the end of the 1990s, the nominal crude oil price was still less than $20 per barrel and it took another half a decade until it climbed to $50. Nonetheless, right before the onset of the financial crisis, it peaked at almost $150. Today, oil priceis already hovering around $100. As supply is declining and demand is increasing, any sign of recovery will boost the price of the crude. If you want to understand the impact, imagine the world as it existed after the end of World War II; that is, before the postwar globalization. When oil prices were still around $20 per barrel in 2000, transport costs amounted to an average tariff rate of 3%. At $150 per barrel, the rate is 11%, which was the average level of the 1970s. If the price will hit $200, it would reflect the kind of average tariff rates that prevailed in the mid-1960s. And if the price soars to above $250, we are back to the 1950s. Export threats in the West In Washington, Iran has already been targeted by sanctions vis-\xc3\xa0-vis weapons development, trade and investment, nuclear materials, financial dealings, assets, and refined gasoline. Last Thursday the U.S. Senate also voted to penalize foreign financial institutions that do business with Iran's central bank, which takes payment for the 2.6 million barrels Iran exports a day. Meanwhile, the EU is considering a U.S.-style ban on Iranian oil imports. However, neither Washington nor Brussels has yet finalized the move against the oil trade or the central bank. Both are concerned of the potential impact on the global economy of restricting oil flows from Iran. But in Europe, the British embassy attackhas dragged relations to a long-time low. The West is not President Ahmadinejad\xe2\x80\x99s only nightmare. Iran is preparing for the March 2012 parliamentary elections. Ahmadinejad is struggling not only against the reformists hoping to resurrect the Green movement, and the supporters of the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. At the same time, a rapidly-evolving fraud case is shifting alignments among Iran\xe2\x80\x99s conservative elite. An investment vehicle managed by Amir Mansour Khosravi has been charged with expropriating US $2.6 billion from half a dozen Iranian banks, while some 30 senior Iranian bankers have fled abroad. And even if Teheran could miraculously boost growth, its financial sector cannot support it in the next few years because credit has doubled to over 90% of GDP in the past decade. In these circumstances, any external intervention would serve to destabilize Iran and oil price, while rallying support for hawks in Iran and the West. Economic recovery would be a secondary priority. Dan Steinbock is research director of International Business at  (USA), visiting fellow at  (China) and in the EU-Center (Singapore).

1489,The Best-Performing Stocks Under $5 in 2011,CNBC Stock Blog,05-12-2011,"After a two-year bull market that followed the 2008 financial crisis, small-caps have been brutalized. The Russell 2000 index, a measure of share performance for smaller companies, is down more than 14 percent since the end of April.Investors have become more risk-averse and have sought safety in dividend-paying, large-cap stocks, U.S. Treasury bonds and even cash. The flight to safety has been torrential, especially as the debt crisis in Europe worsens.Overall, the Russell 2000 index has dropped 6 percent this year, while the S&P 500, which holds the companies with the largest market values, is down a fraction of a percent. At the same time, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury has dwindled from 3.3 percent to 2 percent.Gold has also been a hideout for investors. The precious metal has jumped from about $1,400 an ounce at the end of 2010 to above $1,700 an ounce.Still, many inexpensive stocks have generated huge returns for lucky stock pickers. In November, amid fears the entire eurozone region would crumble under the weight of its debt, stocks like Pacific Ethanol  and Spanish Broadcasting System  more than doubled.But given the volatility in the equity market, investors must be careful in searching out small-cap stocks worth the risk, as fortunes can be lost with one bad trade. For example, American Airlines parent AMR Corp. dropped more than 87 percent last month on its bankruptcy announcement, while FiberTower and Delta Petroleum each sank 70 percent.Some small-cap winners have doubled and, in some cases, tripled and quadrupled this year.The following details the best-performing stocks under $5 this year on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and NYSE Amex, ranked by total return in 2011.5. VicalCompany Profile: Vical develops gene-based treatments for cancer and infectious disease vaccines using DNA technology and proprietary lipids.Vical's  stock has had an up-and-down 2011, beginning the year at $2 before spiking above $5 in July after the company signed an exclusive license contract with Astrellas Pharma for the commercialization of TransVax, Vical's therapeutic vaccine designed to control cytomegalovirus reactivation in transplant recipients.By October, shares of Vical slipped below $3 before jumping back above $4 in November after the company reported third-quarter earnings results, which included $25 million in licensing revenue from TransVax.Share Price: $4.59 (Dec. 2) 2011 Total Return: 127 percent. Analyst Ratings: Vical has the most coverage of any stock on the list with nine analysts following the company. Six say the stock is a ""buy"" while the other three suggest that investors hold onto shares.The average price target of $7.20 is about 57 percent above current levels.TheStreet Ratings has a ""hold"" rating on Vical, noting that the company's ""robust revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures and solid stock price performance"" is counterbalanced by disappointing return on equity.4. Interphase Company Profile: Interphase is a telecom-equipment maker. The company provides services for LTE and WiMAX, interworking gateways, packet processing, network connectivity and security for key applications.Interphase  shares more than doubled on Feb. 11, a day after the company reported fourth-quarter financial results. The company said revenue in the quarter jumped 24 percent to $5.8 million as it swung to a quarterly profit. The stock hit a high of $7.59 in March but has been steadily pulling back since.Share Price: $4.59 (Dec. 2) 2011 Total Return: 155 percent. Analyst Ratings: There are no research firms covering Interphase currently. TheStreet Ratings has a ""sell"" rating on the stock, which it has maintained since downgrading the stock from ""hold"" in July 2009.The latest report says Interphase's primary weakness is ""feeble growth in its earnings per share."" 3. Adolor Corp.Company Profile: Adolor develops new products and delivers advanced pain and pain-management therapies.Adolor wouldn't make the list of best-performing stocks under $5 this year if it weren't for a takeover bid in October from Cubist Pharmaceuticals , which will buy the company in a $415 million deal.Share Price: $4.69 (Dec. 2) 2011 Total Return: 287 percent. Analyst Ratings: As Adolor is an acquisition waiting to happen, the analysts following the stock are split over what investors should do.Three say the stock is still a ""buy"" while the other two researchers following Adolor say investors should hold onto shares.TheStreet Ratings has a ""sell"" rating on Adolor shares, saying that ""the company's primary weakness has been its disappointing return on equity."" 2. Majesco Entertainment Company Profile: Majesco Entertainment makes video games mainly for the family-oriented, mass-market consumer.Majesco's run this year started in January when the company announced it had shipped more than 500,000 copies of its Zumba Fitness video game for the Wii, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.Later that month, the company announced it regained compliance with the Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement for continued listing.In early March, shares of Majesco climbed higher after the company posted better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter financial results, with revenue jumping to $48.5 million from $29.2 million in the same period a year earlier.In June, Majesco upped its full-year revenue outlook as it expects to ship 17 new games this year across platforms like the Xbox Kinect, Facebook, Nintendo's 3DS and Apple's iPhone.Share Price: $3.10 (Dec. 2) 2011 Total Return: 303 percent. Analyst Ratings: Majesco garners three ""buy"" ratings from Needham & Co., Northland Securities and Sidoti & Co. Majesco also receives a ""neutral"" rating from Wedbush. The average price target of $4.42 is 42 percent above current levels.TheStreet Ratings has a ""buy"" recommendation on Majesco Entertainment after upgrading the stock in October.While TheStreet Ratings says the company has some minor weaknesses, the report lauds the company's ""robust revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, notable return on equity, solid stock price performance and impressive record of earnings per share growth."" 1. TeamStaff Company Profile: TeamStaff is a staffing provider specializing in health-care, logistical, information-technology and office administration personnel.Shares of TeamStaff  initially popped in May after the company was chosen as the single source for integrated medical support for the Department of Veterans Affairs' Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy program, an award that carries a total maximum value of $140 million.The company has also been awarded other contracts, including the Navy SeaPort-e ""prime"" contract in July, which allows TeamStaff access to bid on $5.3 billion of services via task orders issued under the SeaPort-e program.Share Price: $2.09 (Dec. 2) 2011 Total Return: 310 percent. Analyst Ratings: No Wall Street research analysts follow TeamStaff.______________________________CNBC Data Pages:Dow 30 Stocks\xe2\x80\x94In Real Time Oil, Gold, Natural Gas Prices Now Where's the US Dollar Today?Track Treasury Prices Here______________________________ Disclosures:TheStreet's editorial policy prohibits staff editors, reporters and analysts from holding positions in any individual stocks.Disclaimer",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/05/the-bestperforming-stocks-under-5-in-2011.html

After doing some research, the \xe2\x80\x9cMad Money\xe2\x80\x9d host prefers Mastercard stock.Compared to Visa , Cramer noted Mastercard  has greater international exposure. Mastercard gets 60 percent of its revenues from outside of the U.S., while Visa gets just 44 percent from international markets.Mastercard is also increasing its market share, Cramer said. It\xe2\x80\x99s currently the number two player with 30 percent of global credit card volumes and 12 percent of global debit volumes, while Visa has 46 percent of the global credit card volumes and 59 percent of the global debit volumes. Mastercard benefits from being the smaller player, Cramer said, because it has more to gain over time. And while Visa has higher margins, Cramer said Mastercard has more room to improve as it becomes larger and more profitable. Visa has operating margins of 64 percent while Mastercard's operating margin came in at 55.1 percent last quarter. As Mastercard takes share, Cramer thinks its margins will continue to improve.Bottom line: Cramer prefers Mastercard stock over Visa, but would use weakness to buy shares little by little.",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/05/cramer-compares-mastercard-visa-stock.html

1492,CEO Blog: \xe2\x80\x98Reversing\xe2\x80\x99 Innovation to Win in Emerging Markets,The Guest Blog,05-12-2011,"Innovation is critical to the heartbeat of any successful corporation in the industrialized world. But competing in emerging markets where vast differences exist in per-capita incomes, infrastructure, customer preferences and environmental pressures, requires redefining the concept of innovation. Reverse innovation is an innovation that is first adopted in developing markets and flows uphill to mature markets. This concept directs forward-looking companies to look beyond industrialized nations to draw new ideas, products and processes from emerging economies. It\xe2\x80\x99s a relatively new idea, but one that will prove critical for businesses looking to expand horizons and capitalize on the rapid growth taking place around the globe. Multinational brands, especially those with successful legacies, often struggle in emerging countries. They may be superior at moving innovations from home to abroad but not the other way around. These companies, generally known for breaking new ground and creating categories, cling to the same rules and assumptions that led to their success, ignoring the significant differences between consumers in industrialized markets and those in emerging economies. To continue advancing, one must be open to the possibility that the next great innovations will likely come out of Bangalore or Shanghai and seek talent and ingenuity residing within these regions. Researchers, engineers and scientists in budding markets intuitively understand local consumer preferences, enabling them to create solutions that meet their unique needs. Reverse innovation occurs when these solutions are brought back to the developed world, generating fresh innovations for consumption in industrialized markets.

That's because December is the last chance to take advantage of money-saving steps before the tax and calendar years end. For investors, its doubly important.Taxes may be inevitable, but they have certainly not been predictable in the last year or two, and 2012 looks likely to bring more of the same. Key tax provisions are set to expire (again), providing significant changes from income brackets, to stock dividends, to inheritance.Tax policy also happens to be a major area of disagreement in Washington at a time when leaders are not only trying to address a gaping hole in the government's balance sheet, but also positioning their parties for an election that decides the presidency and perhaps the Senate majority.",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/05/tackling-taxes-head-on.html

There were a few positive indicators in September, rising housing starts and rising home sales, that gave some analysts fodder for optimism, but the readings on prices are far less rosy, and alas far more complicated. Two reports out today show home prices are falling again after seeing some gains in the Spring and Summer. Lender Processing Servicessays they're down 3.7 percent annually in September, erasing the gains of the Spring, and they say all of the 13,500 zip codes it tracks are in the negative. Meanwhile CoreLogic says prices fell 3.9 percent in October, but when you take out foreclosures and short sales (the latter when the home is sold for less than the value of the mortgage), home prices are down just 0.5 percent annually. The vaunted S&P/Case-Shiller home price index was down 3.9 percent in September, and that's a three month running average including distressed and non-distressed property sales.

1528,Many Workers in Public Sector Retiring Sooner ,Politics,06-12-2011,"As states and cities struggle to resolve paralyzing budget shortfalls by sending workers on unpaid furloughs, freezing salaries and extracting larger contributions for health benefits and pensions, a growing number of public-sector workers are finding fewer reasons to stay.The numbers of retireesare way up in Wisconsin, where more applications to retire have been filed this year than ever before. Workers in California\xe2\x80\x99s largest public employee pension systemhave retired at a steadily increasing rate over the last five fiscal years. In New Jersey, thousands more teachers, police officers, firefighters and other public workers filed retirement papers during the past two years than in the previous two years. In part, the flood of retirements reflects a broader demographic picture. Baby boomers, wherever they work, have begun reaching the traditional retirement age. But increasingly workers fear a permanent shift away from the traditional security of government jobs, and they are making plans to get out now, before salaries and retirement benefits retreat further. \xe2\x80\x9cYou start to feel like, \xe2\x80\x98What will they do next?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d said Bob McLinn, 63, a labor union president who left his job with the Wisconsin Department of Corrections in March, earlier than he planned, after political leaders pressed to cut benefits and collective bargaining rights for workers. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s always been this promise that if you came to work and did your job, at the end there would be your reward \xe2\x80\x94 a defined retirement. The idea was you could retire with respect and dignity. But that whole idea has been slashed now, and I felt like, \xe2\x80\x98What is the point?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d In some places, the rise in retirement has brought welcome and needed financial news. Kansas announced last month that it would save $34.5 million over two years because more than 1,000 workers had agreed to accept cash and health insurance incentives to leave. State officials said they had yet to determine which of the positions of departing workers they considered critical enough to refill. But some experts and workers question the ultimate result of so much leaving, saying it is already leaving some governments short-staffed (and, in some cases, obliged to pay overtime) and at risk of losing institutional knowledge and technical expertise as older workers vanish. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see is a lot of young people reinventing the wheel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Karen Gunderson, 56, who retired this year from her information technology job with the State of Wisconsin after 26 years, a few years sooner than she had intended, saying she felt that public workers were being \xe2\x80\x9cturned into scapegoats\xe2\x80\x9d for a troubled economy. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to waste a lot of tax dollars with young people attempting things that were tried before. You can get people cheaper, but whether you save money, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d The pattern of retirements, while pronounced in some states and towns, has by no means played out everywhere. In fact, a countervailing trend \xe2\x80\x94 of delaying retirement and staying put \xe2\x80\x94 has been clear since after 2008, when the national recession and the shortage of jobs (and of potential second careers in the private sector) made people queasy about making moves at all. Certainly, the number of state and local public-sector workers has been shrinking since the second half of 2008, a necessary, useful scaling back in the eyes of some political leaders facing major budget shortfalls. Across the nation, there were 71,000 fewer state government workers in November than there were a year ago, and 180,000 fewer local government workers, federal Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. But a broad survey of about 100 public retirement systems suggests a rate of retirement that has remained within a relatively steady range in recent years, said Keith Brainard, research director for the . \xe2\x80\x9cBefore I would call this a trend, it would need to continue for another year or two,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Still, even with lingering queasiness over jobs and the larger economy, there are other signs that the mood of public workers is turning toward retirement, a worrisome possibility for some already precarious, underfunded pension plans.

1545,Movie Mogul Says Don\xe2\x80\x99t Give Up on Netflix ,Halftime Report,06-12-2011,"Sometimes the best market insights come from the people who are in the thick of things and few business titans are more in the middle of media\xc2\xa0 than Todd Wagner, the co-founder of Broadcast.com and co-owner of 2929 Entertainment with Mark Cuban.Wagner is among the nation\xe2\x80\x99s most dynamic entrepreneurs; he launched his business from nothing in 1995, took it public in 1998 and then sold it Yahoo! for $5.7 billion in 1999.Using his success at Broadcast.com as a platform, Wagner then built the Wagner/Cuban Companies, an innovative portfolio of companies that spans content creation, distribution and exhibition.> NEW SLIDESHOW: 10 Top Stocks for the Long-Term InvestorWagner also has a stake in the Dallas Mavericks, and he continues to invest in and nurture start-ups. He holds interests in Lions Gate Entertainment, and The Weinstein Company.Among Wagner's claims to fame - he revolutionized how movies are distributed by putting them on demand first then releasing them in theaters.Considering his strong connection to the media industry the Fast Money pros were eager to hear his thoughts on a number of companies \xe2\x80\x93 but none more than Netflix. Following are his comments:Netflix\xe2\x80\x9dI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\xc2\xa0 give up the ship on Netflix ,\xe2\x80\x9d Wagner tells us. He compares Netflix\xe2\x80\x99 current state of affairs to the early days of Amazon when investors were skeptical of Jeff Bezos. But Amazon, not only survived, it thrived as the Internet evolved.Wagner suggests that Netflix CEO Reed Hastings may be like Jeff Bezos. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe that Netflix has enough time - they get that they've made mistakes and I wouldn't give up the ship."" And if you have a long term time horizon Wagner says, \xe2\x80\x9cI would bet on a guy like this.\xe2\x80\x9dYahoo!\xe2\x80\x9cYahoo! is facing a classic case of brain drain \xe2\x80\x93 they have to get their mojo back,\xe2\x80\x9d says Wagner.Although that my sound challenging, Wagner doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible by any stretch. \xe2\x80\x9cThey need the right leader,"" he says. ""And they need to take drastic measures."" But with the right CEO and an aggressive game plan, Wagner adds that they could certainly turn around. Time will tell. LinkedIn\xe2\x80\x9dLinkedIn may be a fabulous company, but we have to wait and see. It's always difficult to predict how to a company will go from start-up to public firm. It's like annointing Lebron as the next Michael Jordan - how about he wins a few times first.\xe2\x80\x9dLionsGate\xe2\x80\x9dI like these guys and I believe they will do what's right for the business. At LionsGate the TV side of the business has done well and they\xe2\x80\x99re sorting through what to do with the movies. They\xe2\x80\x99ve done a good job.\xe2\x80\x9dGridlock in WashingtonWe also talked with Wagner about the gridlock in Washington, a topic about which Wagner feels strongly. \xe2\x80\x9d(Americans) are tried of the far left and the far right owning the conversation,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. It comes at the detriment to what most Americans believe \xe2\x80\x93 which is we need compromise.\xe2\x80\x9dHere\xe2\x80\x99s what Wagner would like to see.1. Either raise takes on mega rich of have each hire 10 people and generate new jobs2.

1554,The Need to Own Dividend-Paying Stocks,Mad Money,06-12-2011,"U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday as investors bet European leaders would take strong steps this week to end the region's debt crisis. According to a published report that cited senior European officials, European leaders will discuss boosting the firepower of the euro zone's rescue fund at a summit scheduled for Thursday and Friday. France and Germany are expected to try to force changes to EU rules to impose mandatory penalties on countries that exceed deficit targets in hopes of restoring market confidence.The news renewed optimism on Wall Street, as the Dow Jones industrial average gained 52.30 points, or 0.43 percent, to 12,150.13 and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index added 1.39 points, or 0.11 percent, to 1,258.47. While Cramer welcomed the gains, he cautioned investors not to get too optimistic, too soon.\xe2\x80\x9cWe have gone from believing the financial world is coming to an end a fortnight ago to believing that the French and the Germans are going to be able to solve all of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s problems and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to live happily ever after,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer noted. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong, I'd love to live happily ever after, but in the interim, you do mind if I get paid to wait?\xe2\x80\x9dThe \xe2\x80\x9cMad Money\xe2\x80\x9d host reiterated his \xe2\x80\x9cpaid to wait\xe2\x80\x9d concept, which involves investing in dividend-paying stocks. Despite economic events or how the overall stock market is faring, high yielding stocks pay investors to wait until things getting better. These stocks could go up or down, but the investor gets the dividend payment nonetheless. Cramer likes 3M , General Electric and Eli Lilly , for example. Each of these stocks has had little movement lately, but each pays a juicy dividend yield. 3M has a 2.8 percent yield while GE pays a 3.7 percent dividend yield and Eli Lilly yields a whopping 5.2 percent.\xe2\x80\x9cYou need dividend payers like this in case Europe falls apart all over again, something nobody seems to be expecting at the moment even as the likelihood that things go wrong over there is still pretty high,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer explained. \xe2\x80\x9cEven if the stocks have done nothing or next to nothing, your wallet\xe2\x80\x99s fatter just for owning them. That\xe2\x80\x99s the main reason I keep stressing dividends and the need to reinvest those dividends back into the stocks to get ever larger amounts of cash from the companies.\xe2\x80\x9dRead on for Cramer\xe2\x80\x99s Top Dividend Stocks 2011",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/06/the-need-to-own-dividendpaying-stocks.html

As a bearish bet on the financials, (or a wager on the collective insanity of the ratings agencies), Dan Nathan of Riskreversal.combought the January 35/30 put spread on Deutsche Bank for $1.10, a trade that could be worth as much as $3.90 if DB trades below $30 by January expiration. Trade and breakdown are below. DAN'S DEUTSCHE BANK OPTIONS TRADE - STOCK AT $40 BUY JAN 35-STRIKE PUT FOR $2.20 SELL JAN 30-STRIKE PUT FOR $1.10 HOW DAN'S DEUTSCHE BANK TRADE MAKES MONEY LOSSES ABOVE $33.90 PROFITS BETWEEN $33.90 - $30.00 PROFITS CAPPED AT $30.00 The other trade required much less premium but carried much greater risk. It came courtesy of Oppenheimer's Carter Worth and Cantor's Mike Khouw. As a bullish play on retailer Target , they bought the January 46/57.5 risk reversal for even money. Specifically, the trade involved selling the January 46-strike put for $0.25 and using that money to buy the January 57.5-strike call for $0.25. The trade costs nothing, but there is a significant tradeoff; by selling that put, Mike could be forced to buy target stock at that put's strike price - or for $46, even if it falls well below that level by expiration. So far so good, and the trade and breakdown are below.

1562,Positive Signs for Apple Retail,Tech Check,06-12-2011,"Apple's self checkout revolution may have seemed a bit crazy, but it's apparently working out.That's what I hear from a source familiar with Apple's  retail operation. To catch you up: You might recall that last month Apple launched a few new retail store initiatives. Among them: a feature in the Apple Store iOS appthat allows anyone with an iPhone or other camera-equipped iOS device to scan a bar code on any item on the shelf in an Apple store and pay for it using an iTunes account. My first thought when I heard about this plan? It's going to make it a lot tougher for Apple to tell shoplifters from legitimate shoppers. In the past, someone walking out of the door with an iPhone case, no bag and no visible receipt was likely up to no good. Now Apple's actually encouraging that behavior. But when I saw the system in action at the Palo Alto store last month, I saw more potential upside. Apple had reconfigured a couple of things in the store to put more eyes on the door. Plus, the system potentially accomplishes two important things. One, it lets experienced Apple shoppers go through the buying process seamlessly, without the final annoying step of having to flag down an employee to make a purchase. Two, it frees store employees to focus on coaching Apple newbies through the shopping process -- a much more profitable use of their time. The intelligence I'm getting is that the benefits of the new system are outweighing any negatives. This new setup could be particularly useful in a store like the one Apple's opening in Grand Central station on Friday. (I hear self checkout will be prominently touted there, which is no big surprise.) And the early success of this self checkout initiative bodes well for Apple's holiday sales. How so? Last fiscal year 13% of Apple's sales came through its retail stores -- and it's safe to assume that percentage is highest during the holiday season. Apple could probably do $5 billion worth of holiday quarter business in its retail stores worldwide. If self checkout is working, that means it's allowing Apple to add sales in those locations without having to increase labor costs. That's got to be good for EPS.

1564,Blog: Stuck in a Rut? Maybe You're too Comfortable,The Guest Blog,06-12-2011,"In his autobiography, Jim Whittaker, a renowned mountaineer and the first American to reach the summit of Mt. Everest, wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe the key to a life well lived\xe2\x80\xa6 is discomfort.\xe2\x80\x9d Whittaker saw discomfort as a way to stretch \xe2\x80\x9cyourself beyond what you already know or know how to do.\xe2\x80\x9d We all experience pain when we twist an ankle or touch scalding water. But \xe2\x80\x98discomfort\xe2\x80\x99 represents an altogether different experience, one that offers the promise of personal growth and character development. I took Whittaker\xe2\x80\x99s message to heart this summer when I cycled for 46 days and 1,500 miles around Iceland connected to my ten-year old son on a trailer cycle and my four-year old daughter in a bike trailer. Sometimes the headwind was so strong that we struggled simply to maintain forward momentum. On the days when the temperature dropped into the 40\xe2\x80\x99s F and rain soaked us through, my son and I shivered, despite layers of clothing, and pedaled harder to stay warm (my daughter was comfortable and dry in her trailer). I told my son, \xe2\x80\x9cThis ride was supposed to be hard. Sometimes an adventurer just suffers for a while.\xe2\x80\x9d The value of discomfort comes from the context in which it is experienced. It was precisely in those moments of discomfort during the ride that I most deeply appreciated the simple joys of life: a meal shared with people I love, soaking in hot water, snuggling up to read to my kids in bed. The suffering made the pleasure, when I finally experienced it, so much better! And, to Whittaker\xe2\x80\x99s point, handling the discomfort was really a lesson in perseverance for my children and me. While my instincts as a father \xe2\x80\x93 rightly so \xe2\x80\x93 are to protect my kids, I think that a parent shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make a child\xe2\x80\x99s life too easy. I wanted them to internalize one of the most satisfying experiences in life: overcoming hardship through effort and focus. Discomfort is not only physical, but may also come in the form of emotional resistance to making a needed change in our lives. I have met people who would like to unshackle themselves from their desks, from unbalanced lives, or unhealthy work environments. Some are looking for opportunities to express parts of themselves that they do not utilize at work, or follow a direction that is more aligned with their true interests rather than, as one friend put it, \xe2\x80\x9ccontinue to unconsciously participate in the herd.\xe2\x80\x9d But many people remain stuck, often because they are intimidated by the consequences of taking action and the discomfort that comes with change. Organizations are emerging that recognize this issue. I recently spoke at a well-attended event in New York City organized by a group called Meet Plan Go. The event encouraged people to take a \xe2\x80\x9ccareer break\xe2\x80\x9d to travel the world \xe2\x80\x9cand have it be beneficial to your career.\xe2\x80\x9d The room was filled with hundreds of people interested in taking a sabbatical from work. Some were dissatisfied with their jobs, felt that something was amiss, and wanted to take initiative to radically change their life direction. Others wanted to volunteer abroad or simply to learn about foreign cultures, then return to their professions rejuvenated. I told the audience about enlightened employers like Intel Corporation , where I worked for fourteen years, that provide full-time employees a paid two-month sabbatical every seven years. One of my fellow speakers, Rita Foley, co-author of Reboot Your Life, conducted interviews with hundreds of people who had taken a career break to travel. She said that, \xe2\x80\x9cWe could not find a single person who had regretted the decision.\xe2\x80\x9d When my son and I give presentations about our ride through Iceland, we always finish by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cSo what are you waiting for? Go out and create your own adventure!\xe2\x80\x9d We could just as easily add Whittaker\xe2\x80\x99s advice: embrace the value of discomfort. Charles Scott is an endurance athlete and family adventurer. He spent 14 years working at Intel Corporation before deciding to focus his energy full-time on writing, speaking and doing endurance challenges with his family linked to environmental causes. While working at Intel, he competed in five Ironman triathlons, eight marathons and many multi-sport and adventure races. In the summer of 2009, he and his eight-year old son Sho rode connected bicycles the length of mainland Japan, covering 2,500 miles in 67 days. They were named \xe2\x80\x9cClimate Heroes\xe2\x80\x9d by the United Nations as they raised money for a global tree planting campaign. And in the summer of 2011, he cycled 1,500 miles around Iceland on connected bicycles with his ten-year old son and four-year old daughter, once again sponsored by the UN as ""Climate Heroes"": . Charles is writing a book about the Japan ride called Rising Son.

1569,Carrizo: A Cheap Small-Cap Oil and Gas Name,Mad Money,06-12-2011,"With oil hovering around $100 for the past few weeks, \xe2\x80\x9cMad Money\xe2\x80\x9d host Jim Cramer believes this is a new era of persistently high oil prices. He thinks one way to play those higher prices is Carrizo Oil and Gas, which has a lot of exposure to the Eagle Ford and Marcellus shales.\xe2\x80\x9cThere have been some bumps in the road with Carrizo  ... but if you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to take the chance on a small-cap oil and gas name, then I think it's a terrific buy here\xe2\x80\x94very cheap with a ton of production growth,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Carrizo, which has a market capitalization of slightly more than $1.1 billion, got slammed over the summer when the price of oil  fell. It has since come back up, but the stock is still well off its highs. And Cramer thinks that makes the name attractive. However, there are also some real reasons for its underperformance, Cramer said. The company had production issues in the Eagle Ford shale last quarter and there are concerns over its North Sea asset. Cramer isn\xe2\x80\x99t too worried since management has stated it has new Eagle Ford wells coming on soon and it expects to get its North Sea project online in mid-2012.Carrizo also has an \xe2\x80\x9coverspending problem,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. There\xe2\x80\x99s about a $200 million deficit between the cash the company\xe2\x80\x99s expected to generate in 2012 and the amount of money it plans to spend. However, Carrizo plans to raise about $100 million in natural gas production in the Barnett shale. (Related: Cramer's Play on High Oil Prices)Cramer thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to focus on the positives, like Carrizo\xe2\x80\x99s increased focus on oil production and the 50 percent production growth the company\xe2\x80\x99s forecasting for next year. The company is also looking for joint venture partners to help finance new projects, and Cramer thinks the company could be a takeover target. However, if you want something safer, Cramer suggests EOG Resources  or ConocoPhilips .",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/06/carrizo-a-cheap-smallcap-oil-and-gas-name.html

Trader Steve Cortes said it was significant if Gartman was getting out of gold, someone who \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely hit the gold call out of the park.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s also notable that silver has very much underperformed gold, and typically when silver lags gold, that\xe2\x80\x99s a problem for both because it tends to be a bit more volatile,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Cortes said he believed the treasury market was correct. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a 2 percent 10-year yield, is telling us that there is no inflationary threat,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there\xe2\x80\x99s not an inflationary threat then you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be long either silver and gold.\xe2\x80\x9d Trader Pete Najarian said he saw positives in the data. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ve been positive and constructive on the market, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to participate in the last 100 points or so of this S&P run,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\xe2\x80\x9dThis is a market where you are seeing some chasing going on because people were uninvested before.\xe2\x80\x9d Najarian said it was important to keep an eye on the tipping point Steve Grasso suggested for an S&P 500 rally if it closes at 1,265. Grasso said a 1,265 close could mean a run toward 1,300 or 1,325. \xe2\x80\x9cYou could have 2 to 4 percent moves in the blink of an eye and no one really even cares anymore,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou could also be back to 12\xc2\xbc.\xe2\x80\x9d Related StoriesSlideshow: 10 Top Stocks for the Long-Term InvestorCNBC.com Special Report: Gold 2011Go for Gold: Jim Cramer's Bullish Bets on BullionJim Rogers Says Gold Due for Correction, Owns Dollar______________________________________________________Got something to to say?

1599,"Big Firms Limit Paying State Taxes, Study Finds",Politics,07-12-2011,"As states have struggled to balance their budgets by cutting services, laying off workers and raising taxes, a study to be released on Wednesday suggests that many profitable Fortune 500 companieshave not been paying as much in state corporate income taxes as the average levied on American companies, with some big firms paying none at all in recent years. A few companies, including DuPont , reported paying no state corporate income taxes from 2008 to 2010 even as they reported profits, according to the study, which was conducted by Citizens for Tax Justice and the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, nonprofit research organizations in Washington that advocate a more progressive tax code. (A spokeswoman for DuPont said that she had not seen the study, but that \xe2\x80\x9cDuPont complies with all tax laws and regulations\xe2\x80\x9d wherever it operates.) This year, there has been a great deal of discussion about whether corporations are paying their fair shareof federal taxes. But the issue resonates at the state level as well, where corporate taxes have long been a shrinking share of state revenues. While corporate income taxes made up 9.7 percent of state revenues in 1980, according to the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government, they now make up only an estimated 5.7 percent. To gauge how much Fortune 500 companies are paying in corporate income taxes, the study looked at the 265 of them that are both profitable and disclose their state tax payments. It found that 68 reported paying no state corporate taxes in at least one year between 2008 and 2010. All together, the study found that the companies reported $1.33 trillion in domestic profits from 2008 to 2010, but paid states only about half of what they would have if they had paid at the average corporate income tax rate of all states \xe2\x80\x94 reducing their state taxes by some $42.7 billion. Matthew Gardner, the executive director of the Institute on Taxation and Economy Policy, said that state corporate-tax collections have dwindled for several reasons. Many states calculate their taxes based on federal corporate taxes, so some recent federal corporate tax breaks have lowered their collections. Other states have granted their own tax breaks to try to promote economic development, or to lure companies from other states. Companies, meanwhile, have grown adept at reducing taxes and finding tax shelters. \xe2\x80\x9cThe math is different at the state level than it is at the federal level,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Gardner said in an interview. \xe2\x80\x9cState lawmakers don\xe2\x80\x99t have the luxury of cutting taxes and not worrying how to pay for it \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99ve got balanced budget requirements, which mean, inexorably, that if you cut a tax you have to pay for it either by hiking another tax or by cutting spending.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Gardner said one limit of the study was that it showed only how much companies paid in total state taxes, not what they paid in each state. He said that for state officials to judge whether their tax codes are effective and fair, they should analyze what big companies are paying.

1605,Morici: German Chancellor Angela Merkel Reforms Will Worsen Euro Crisis ,The Guest Blog,07-12-2011,"European leaders are working feverously to create what German Chancellor Merkel is calling a \xe2\x80\x9cfiscal union\xe2\x80\x9d to restore private investor confidence in Europe and rekindle growth. Unfortunately, what she advocates will thrust Europe into a deeper economic crisis, and leave European leaders without the fiscal and monetary policy tools necessary to combat recessions. The reforms Chancellor Merkel is pushing\xe2\x80\x94hard caps on national government deficits--will ensure either the ultimate demise of the euro, years of economic stagnation or worse. For many governments, those caps will be one half or even one quarter of recent annual deficits, and to comply they will dramatically raise taxes, cut spending and curtail pensions and other social benefits. Already, the Mediterranean economies are contracting rapidly, and Germany and other more prosperous states are near zero growth. Harsh austerity in France, Italy, and elsewhere will be \xe2\x80\x9cnegative stimulus\xe2\x80\x9d and thrust most if not the entire continent into a deep and prolonged recession . Rising unemployment will feed on itself, national tax bases will shrink, and sovereign debtwill become less manageable. Private investors, though perhaps initially comforted after Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s reforms are adopted, again will become skeptical that Italy and the others will pay their debts and flee government bonds. European governments will be impotent to address the recession, because Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s enforceable caps on national budget deficits will not create a \xe2\x80\x9cfiscal union.\xe2\x80\x9d The euro zone as a whole and the larger European Union will continue to lack the fiscal and monetary policy tools U.S. and Japanese governments have to manage recessions. The U.S. federal government has broad taxing, spending and borrowing authority, and jointly with the states, finances social security and pensions, health care and other essential public services. Although the 50 states face significant limits on how much they can borrow during a recession, Washington can increase its deficit to further assist states, and it cuts taxes and spends more directly on new projects to stimulate the private sector. The Great Recession would have been longer and deeper without those fiscal powers\xe2\x80\x94 powers the European Union now lacks and still lack after Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s reforms. Until now, responsibilities for combating recessions in Europe fell entirely on the individual member governments. With Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s reforms, those governments won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to increase deficits to stem unemployment, and Brussels still won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to do it for them, as Washington does for the 50 states. The European Central Bank could push down short term interest rates but as we have learned, yet again in the United States, that primary instrument of monetary policy is not much help for stemming recessions. Moreover, because the European Union lacks taxing powers and does not issue euro denominated bonds, the ECB, for example, can\xe2\x80\x99t buy long-term debt on a scale similar to the Federal Reserve to engage in quantitative easing. Simply, the ECB has fewer tools than the Fed. ",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/07/morici-german-chancellor-angela-merkel-reforms-will-worsen-euro-crisis.html

The fight du jour is how and whether to extend the payroll tax cut, and Steven Englander, head of G10 currency strategy at Citigroup, says the back and forth could affect the dollar. ""Failure to reach a compromise extending the payroll tax cut would presumably be a risk-off outcome that would lift the USD,"" he wrote in a note to clients. If Republicans have their way, and a corporate dividend repatriation proposal passes, Englander says that would lift the dollar as well. If the payroll tax cut is extended and dividend repatriation does not pass, he says that would be dollar negative. How do you trade on the debate? In the very near term, you don't, says Englander - ""but in the week before Christmas it may begin to drive FX."" So keep an eye on the payroll tax battle.

As the year\xe2\x80\x99s end draws near, hedge fund mangers are feeling a greater sense of urgency to finish the year strong. Instead of betting against this market, Cramer thinks they are using the dips to buy stocks. They are putting money to work because they are afraid not to, Cramer said. After all, they don\xe2\x80\x99t want their investors accusing them of missing an opportunity to make money.Meanwhile, Cramer said the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks of the world are working to promote growth and confidence in European markets.

1627,Chipotle and Panera vs. Buffalo Wild Wings,Mad Money,07-12-2011,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Panera Bread and Buffalo Wild Wings may have similar growth rates, but they trade at different multiples. And there\xe2\x80\x99s a reason for that, \xe2\x80\x9cMad Money\xe2\x80\x9d host Jim Cramer said Wednesday. Buffalo Wild Wings  has a 21 percent growth rate, Chipotle  has a 20 percent growth rate and Panera  has an 18 percent growth rate. However, Buffalo Wild Wings sells for 19 times earnings, while Panera sales for 26 times earnings and Chipotle sells for 38 times earnings. Why the disparity? 1. The \xe2\x80\x9csquishy, ethereal qualitative factors\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cBoth [Chipotle and Panera] have found a niche that\xe2\x80\x99s extremely popular and incredibly difficult to replicate,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. They also focus on healthy eating, which carries a lot of weight with consumers. Buffalo Wild Wings, on the other hand, is a bar and grill, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the largest category in casual dining. 2. Sales numbersThe growth from same-store sales is more important than opening new stores, Cramer said. In same-store sales, Chipotle saw an increase of 11.3 percent, Panera saw a 6 percent rise and Buffalo Wild Wings only saw a 4.25 percent increase at its franchised locations and a 5.7 percent increase from its company-owned stores.Chipotle is also the leader when it comes to opening new stores. It expects a 14 percent annual increase in store count for 2012. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, it can open at least three to four times the current store count of 1,163 before saturating the country. Panera is looking at about a 7.5 percent increase and is also far from reaching the saturation point. Buffalo Wild Wings is forecasting 12 percent unit growth for next year. The problem, Cramer said, is that management has stated the company can only support about 1,400 in the United States. It expects to hit 824 restaurants by the end of this year.3. Business modelChipotle owns 100 percent of its restaurants, Panera owns about half and franchises the other half, and Buffalo Wild Wings is only 35 percent company owned and 65 percent franchised.\xe2\x80\x9cGenerally, we pay less for companies that rely on franchises to drive growth because franchising can really limit your upside,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. 4. Restaurant margin levelsChipotle has the best restaurant margin levels of the bunch at 26.7 percent, Buffalo Wild Wings has 19.3 percent and Panera has 17.9 percent. But Cramer thinks Chipotle and Panera are both in a better position to handle rising costs than Buffalo Wild Wings since they have a greater ability to raise prices. \xe2\x80\x9cI think Chipotle, Panera and Buffalo Wild Wings are all pretty fairly valued where they are,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said, \xe2\x80\x9csince Chipotle deserves a higher multiple than Panera, which deserves a higher multiple than Buffalo Wild Wings, even as all three are pretty fabulous investments.\xe2\x80\x9d ",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/07/chipotle-and-panera-vs-buffalo-wild-wings.html

Starting at a buy? Zillow ($32 target), LinkedIn ($85 target) and IAC ($55 target). Another bit of bad news for BlackBerry maker RIM : A U.S. federal court has blocked the company from using the BBX trademark for its new operating system ... software development company Basis had cried foul, because it's called its product BBX for quite a while. RIM in a statement said it will start referring to the OS as BlackBerry 10. Let's take a look at the biggest news from innovators. Here's one to watch:Uber, a service that lets you order a car service on your smartphone and pay with your smartphone, has announced $32 million in a series B round of funding led by Menlo Ventures, Goldman Sachs and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's private investment arm. (It'll be $39 million by the time the round's over.) I caught up with V.C. Shervin Pishevar of Menlo Ventures this morning to talk about Uber's plan to expand to 24 more cities in 2012, and asked -- what's Uber's secret sauce? ""They're hiring PhDs. They're hiring data scientists at Uber that are slicing and dicing that data, and basically figuring out what is the optimal way to route cars to consumers fastest,"" Pishevar said. ""Also they see interesting economic indicators of how well a city is doing, how well a neighborhood is doing, based on the volume and traffic of Uber."" Plus, using the service sounds a lot better than hailing a cab. A couple more headlines to watch: Flipboard, a startup that's trying to reinvent digital publishing, is expanding beyond its iPad app that's done quite well -- today it's launched an iPhone app that allows you to stay up to speed on your social networks while also getting nuggets from mainstream publications. (The iPhone launch was popular enough that it temporarily knocked the entire Flipboard service offline.) And Microsoft unveiled details of its Windows Store, its upcoming app store for Windows 8. The minimum price of apps will be $1.49, maximum just under a thousand dollars, and Microsoft will let developers of the highest-grossing apps keep 80 percent of the revenue. Want to weigh in?

1641,"As Europe\xe2\x80\x99s Bond Market Dries Up, Traders Fear for Jobs",Europe News,07-12-2011,"Pity the European bond trader.Once the master of a booming euro zone universe spanning Greece, Italy and Germany, he now presides over a shrunken, fear-struck bond market \xe2\x80\x94 and might well lose his job by the end of the year.Panic that the default of a euro zone economy might lead to a crackup of the monetary union has turned European bonds, once freely traded and viewed as risk-free, into semi-poisonous hot potatoes that in some cases trade only by appointment.The result has been a sharp drop-off in trading volume \xe2\x80\x94 the mother\xe2\x80\x99s milk of bank profits \xe2\x80\x94 raising questions within capital-constrained banks in Europe about how much longer they will stick with their overstaffed bond divisions.They may number only about a thousand here in Europe\xe2\x80\x99s bond trading hub, but these highly paid traders, sales people and derivatives wizards have in many ways been at the vanguard of the boom and bust of the European debt bubble. Now that bubble risks pushing the euro zone into a second recession at the cost of millions of public and private sector jobs.When money was cheap, bond traders facilitated the borrowing excesses of Greece, Italy and others \xe2\x80\x94 but once these debts came into question, they have been among the first to sell, and they continue to do so.As Europe\xe2\x80\x99s leaders prepare to gather in Brussels on Friday to chart a course to closer political union, the bond purveyors are again attracting scrutiny \xe2\x80\x94 only this time it is from their cost-conscious employers.The numbers tell much of the tale.During an earlier era when Greece could borrow money at nearly the same interest rate as Germany, Greek government bonds traded at the rate of as much as 60 billion euros a month. Through the first two weeks of September, just 1 million euros in Greek bonds exchanged hands on HDAT, the main platform for trading Greek bonds.With Greece on the verge of default, such a result is hardly surprising. But as the fears of a euro zone collapse have spread in recent weeks, volumes have dried up for larger markets as well.Italy, one of the deepest, most sophisticated bond markets in the world, reported that secondary market bond trading on its main MTS platform withered to 887 million euros on Nov. 24, from 5.9 billion euros on Jan. 7, 2010.\xe2\x80\x9cThis is an illiquid market that is really depressed \xe2\x80\x94 there is just no appetite for position-taking right now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Smith, an economist at ICAP in London, a leading broker-dealer that facilitates trades between large institutions. It is hard for bond traders, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are there to make a market and instead you just sit there.\xe2\x80\x9dKonstantinos Panayides, who was responsible for trading Greek bonds at Barclays Capital until he was let go this summer, knows the feeling.\xe2\x80\x9cIt was dead,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere were no prices and no one was taking positions,\xe2\x80\x9d not just for Greek bonds, but for Italian bonds as well, he recalled. He described an atmosphere of near panic as foreign investors unloaded their bonds to the big banks, which then had to find some way to move these deteriorating assets off their books.Despite his reduced circumstances, Mr. Panayides, who is 31 and from Cyprus, does his best to keep up his bond trader\xe2\x80\x99s swagger. He has no plans to return to a big bank, but is enthusiastic about a move to a small brokerage house where he will focus on distressed securities.\xe2\x80\x9cYou never give up,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sipping a coffee in a cafe near his home in central London.But there is no getting around it, he said. With banks reducing their balance sheets aggressively and risk appetite diminished, the environment is going to get worse before it gets better.\xe2\x80\x9cA lot of people are going to get laid off,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.Perhaps surprisingly, there have not yet been any mass layoffs in the euro government bond sector, which as early as 2009 was one of the main profit drivers for the large European banks.That is largely because these areas have been profitable in the past, with top banks like Barclays Capital bringing in revenue of about 1 billion euros in a very good year. And unlike more risky pursuits like proprietary trading or structured products, bond trading does not require a significant outlay of capital.But the process of reducing staff may be beginning.",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/07/as-europes-bond-market-dries-up-traders-fear-for-jobs.html

1657,Blog: Can Twitter Really Increase Awareness for a Business or Brand? ,The Guest Blog,08-12-2011,"Can Twitter really increase awareness for a business or brand? Wendy's might think so. The hamburger company wins the Golden Tweet Award this year, which means one of its Twitter postings was the most retweeted Tweet of the year.Notable this year is that Wendy's most retweeted Tweet was a Promoted Tweets. This is Twitter's advertising model that allows companies to pay for their promotional Tweets to be highlighted in users' timelines and search results. ""Promoted Tweets allow an advertiser to reach the right person with the right message at the right time,"" said Shane Steele, director of sales marketing at Twitter. ""The power of Promoted Tweets reaching new audiences in a short period of time comes from the Retweet. Retweeting makes it possible for one message to reach millions of people regardless of how many followers an individual brand or user has."" The Tweet in question was part of a Wendy's Father's Day advertising campaign in June. It asked users to participate in the hashtag #TreatItFwd. For every time that the Tweet was retweeted, Wendy's donated 50 cents to The Dave Thomas Foundation For Adoption, an organization that helps foster children find permanent homes. The Tweet is still fairly active with several retweets per day six months later. It has since raised $50,000. The #TreatItFwd campaign was such a success for Wendy's that a Tweet from the same campaign was the second most retweeted Tweet of the year. The campaign was big buzz for Wendy's charity but it would be telling to see if the company sold more hamburgers as a result. Subliminal advertising does seem rather powerful to me and I find myself wanting a cheeseburger as I click through to Wendy's Twitter page but I am four months pregnant so I might not count. ""Of the 60 billion Tweets that people shared on Twitter this year, the fact that a Promoted Tweet was retweeted the most indicates that advertisers like @Wendys are getting things right,"" writes the company on the Twitter blog. ""When the message matters to people, a Promoted Tweet no longer seem like an ad--instead, it\xe2\x80\x99s content that you want to share."" Promoted Tweets was the first attempt by Twitter to monetize the popular microblogging service. It launched in April of 2010 with brands such as Starbucks, Bravo, and Virgin America. Users see Tweets that are clearly marked as promotions if Twitter deems them relevant to each user based on their likes, dislikes, and habits. Users can dismiss Promoted Tweets that they find irrelevant. Twitter learns to target each user better based on their interaction with the Promoted Tweet such as whether or not they click the link in the promotion, retweet the Tweet, or dismiss the promotion altogether. Last year's Golden Tweet Award did not go to a Promoted Tweet. In the award's inaugural year, the winner was Comedy Central talkshow host Stephen Colbert for his Tweet that referenced the Gulf Oil Spill. Natali Morris is a technology contributor to CNBC. Previously she was the technology contributor to The CBS Early Show and a technology news anchor and reporter for CNET TV. She has covered technology since 2008.

1664,EU Debt Crisis Hampers US Stocks,Fast Money,08-12-2011,"U.S. stocks fell on Thursday after the European Central Bank  dashed hopes that policymakers were preparing a financial ""bazooka"" to contain the region\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign debt  crisis, and Germany rejected some proposals to add power to the euro zone's bailout fund.U.S. markets have been on edge all week in anticipation of a summit deal that would come to grips with the euro zone's growing debt crisis, and pave the way for greater action by the ECB to hold down bond yields. But actions from Europe \xe2\x80\x94 both early and late in the day \xe2\x80\x94 were a stark disappointment. Trader Joe Terranova said he lost a lot of money in Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clousy\xe2\x80\x9d market. Terranova pared down his exposure and got out of many names, particularly in the energy space. He completely got out of Hess , a stock he\xe2\x80\x99s long held.This market is trading in a range, Terranova said, so investors should be \xe2\x80\x9cextremely defensive\xe2\x80\x9d for the remainder of the year. Drakon Capital\xe2\x80\x99s Guy Adami agreed, noting the \xe2\x80\x9cdefined range\xe2\x80\x9d in the S&P is between the 1,225 and 1,265 level. Everything could change, Adami added, depending upon what happens with Europe\xe2\x80\x99s debt problems. The financials largely led the decline Thursday. There were sharp losses in European banks\xe2\x80\x99 shares, too, following a report the European Banking Authority saw the capital shortfall at European banks at 114.7 billion euros ($154 billion). Shares of Morgan Stanley , a barometer of risk aversion due to its perceived exposure to Europe's crisis, fell 8.4 percent to $15.88. In turn, Adami thinks all bank stocks are a sell. Terranova dumped all shares of American Express , another stock he\xe2\x80\x99s held for some time.Trader Karen Finerman, however, takes a different view on the banks. Finerman thinks policymakers will eventually solve the debt crisis and is willing to hold onto her position in JPMorgan Chase . She thinks the stock has a lot of value. ______________________________________________________Got something to to say?

1666,"Busch: BOE Stays on Hold, ECB Cuts",The Guest Blog,08-12-2011,"Today, the Bank of England left rates and quantitative easing on hold as Governor King decides to wait before more additional easing measures are taken and says that the events in Europe are beyond his control. In October, the BOE surprised the markets with an aggressive increase in QE by 75bln GBP to 275bln GBP. These purchases will be completed in February and the current market expectations are for more QE then. This is despite the downgrade to the 2012 GDP forecasts by not only the central bank, but also by the OBR (Office of Budget Responsibility). While King is correct that European circumstances are beyond his control, but not acting now to address the rapidly declining economy and not preparing the UK market for an exogenous event out of Europe appears to be whistling past the graveyard. Speaking of the dead, the ECB  cut interest rates today by 25bps to 1.0%, they lengthened the Long Term Refinancing Operations unlimited lending facility to 3 years from 12 months,they eased collateral rules at the central bank and they cut the reserve ratio from 2% to 1%. These were all done in the hope of easing the liquidity crisis for European banks especially during the turn of the year crunch. Sadly, this doesn't address the solvency issue for the banks and sovereigns. During the press conference, ECB President Draghi stated that he didn't signal more bond purchases (SMP) and took away the major item that would've helped on the solvency issue. Equity markets and Risk-On tanked after this comment on bond purchases. This is precisely what I was concerned about on Monday and Draghi didn't disappoint. He needed to walk back the recent rumors/leaks/comments by the ECB on what they would do to assist European leaders if they agreed to a fiscal compact. This is the cudgel needed to prompt compliance and cohesion amongst the 17 Euro zone members to act. It is the razor's edge that must be walked by the ECB or they end up rewarding the fiscal miscreants within the monetary union. Thus, the ECB sets the stage for the European Union leaders' summitand sends a strong signal that there will be no reward without meaningful action. While the Germans may attempt to be walking back expectations on the outcome, Draghi is telling them to run forward or risk falling backwards. I believe the EU leaderswill debate the proposals from ""Merkozy"", provide reassuring comments of the necessity of the changes and agree to move forward on them. However, they will not move with the speed that the markets require. Germany and France (and whoever is left with AAA ratings) will be forced to move ahead, skirt the issue of referendums and ultimately tell other Euro zone members to join or risk the abyss. This translates into more volatility for markets heading into Q1, but with a downside protected by global central banks acting in unison (rate cuts, US dollar lending, currency intervention, etc.).

Well, its been a little over two months since the Durbin Act has been implemented, so how are consumers fairing?

1686,How to Avoid Currency Traders' Biggest Mistakes,Money in Motion,08-12-2011,"Strategies abound for trading currencies, but here are some key mistakes you can avoid.Currency markets have been wild and crazy lately, but through it all, traders seem to have put on more money-making trades than the opposite. All good, right? Not exactly. According to a new analysis using data from the broker FXCM*, traders are losing more money on the losing trades than they are making money on the winners. One example: euro-dollar  trades through FXCM were profitable 59% of the time - but traders pocketed an average of only 65 pips on the ones that made money, and lost 127 pips, on average, on losing trades. Investors fared even worse trading the British pound against the yen: the winners gained only 52 pips, and the losers lost an average of 122 pips. ""While traders were correct more than half the time, they lost nearly twice as much on their losing trades as they won on winning trades losing money overall,"" says David Rodriguez, a quantitative strategist at Daily FX.How do you keep from making the same mistakes? For starters, follow the classic trading advice: keep profitable trades going, get out early when you're on the losing end - and always seek out trades that you believe offer more potential reward than potential loss.This is simpler than it sounds in the currency markets, where you can easily use stop-loss orders at the outset of every trade. That's what Rodriguez recommends. Other tips: make sure your profit target is at least as far away as your stop - and don't change the stop unless you're moving it in your favor to lock in profits.

""If a \xe2\x80\x98solution\xe2\x80\x99 for EUR  were to materialize, EUR would likely pop higher, however the medium-term outlook for EUR would still be to trend lower (we have a 2012 year-end forecast of 1.25),"" says Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist for Scotia Capital, in a note to clients.

1698,Blog: What it Takes to Restore US Competitiveness ,The Guest Blog,08-12-2011,"In this era of financial instability and governmental austerity, many argue that government and businesses can no longer afford to launch bold new programs aimed at making a big difference in the lives of citizens. They say transformational efforts like the US space program, the Internet and Social Security are impossible. The gridlock in Washington to forge a budget compromise seems to confirm this conclusion.We, at IBM , disagree. We believe it is still possible to launch bold, world-changing initiatives and investments in our future. They just need to be approached differently, with focus on bridging gaps in political viewpoints and strengthening our nation. Today, government must work collaboratively with businesses, universities and community organizations to tackle our most demanding challenges and improve our global economic competitiveness. Public-private partnerships, where all of the parties invest and share financial risks and rewards, are an essential element of that different approach. In New York, such partnerships are crucial to initiatives aimed at expanding the high-tech workforce, encouraging new-company formation and fostering innovation. New York City is in the final stages of choosing among seven competing proposals for its Applied Sciences NYC initiative. The plan is to build a new world-class science and technology campus that will be an engine for economic development for the city, an opportunity to expand for universities and a source of talent for corporations. Universities, including Stanford, NYU, Cornell and Columbia, have teamed with each other and, in some cases, industrial partners, to put together proposals, and the city has pledged to provide free land and up to $100 million in capital spending. But science and technology education does not start at the university level. We need to create a large talent pool of people with technical skills that businesses need to be competitive. That is why IBM formed a partnership earlier this year with the New York City Department of Education, the City University of New York and NYC College of Technology to create a new public school, called P-TECH (Pathways in Technology Early College High School), which combines high school and the first two years of college. The goal is to prepare students to fill entry-level jobs in technology fields and provide them with foundational knowledge that will allow some to pursue science and math degrees in a four-year college. IBM is providing software and helping to develop the curriculum and coordinate mentoring and internships to build the skills we need to stay globally competitive. P-TECH graduates will get first crack at jobs with IBM. We\xe2\x80\x99re partnering-up at the state level, as well. Two months ago, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced plans by private industry and the state to invest $4.4 billion to extend America\xe2\x80\x99s leadership in semiconductor technology. IBM\xe2\x80\x99s piece of the initiative, an investment of $3.6 billion, will go toward updating our East Fishkill chip fabrication plant and supporting Albany Nanotech, a strategic collaboration of New York, SUNY Albany, IBM and other technology companies aimed at creating the next generations of breakthrough computer chip technologies. New York is investing $400 million and other corporations are chipping in another $400 million. The investments are expected to preserve or create 6,900 high-tech jobs in the state. The chip alliance stands out as a model for economic development, talent-pool expansion and job creation in the 21st century. The state, the university and the technology companies involved all have their parochial interests, but they also have interests in common. By combining their efforts and sharing resources they created a tremendous initiative that the individual organizations could not achieve on their own. In public-private partnerships, government, businesses and academia bring together some of the brightest and most expert people in all of society. When people from diverse backgrounds come together, innovation happens. In this intellectual crucible, we find solutions to problems that no single party would have envisioned. Innovation is vital for improving America\xe2\x80\x99s competitiveness. But while scientific and technological innovation in the private sector are necessary, they\xe2\x80\x99re not sufficient. We need to develop creative new approaches to solving complex problems and to making our society more productive\xe2\x80\x94and public-private partnerships are one important way to do that. At a time when some of the old tried-and-true solutions don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be working, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to focus on something that does work.

1699,Spain's Former Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar on the Arab Awakening and How the West Should React ,The Guest Blog,09-12-2011,"A year ago, the personal immolation of a young street vendor, having had enough abuse and humiliation from government officials, started a popular revolt that not only brought an end to decades of dictatorship in Tunisia, but set in motion a chain reaction that challenged the stability and the future of an entire region. After Ben Ali was deposed in Tunisia, Mubarak was deposed in Egypt. Shalel in Yemen faced massive demonstrations demanding his dismissal. Bahrain\xe2\x80\x99s Shia majority also revolted against its Sunni rulers. In Libya, Bengazi rebels initiated a military campaign that, after six month of fighting, put an end to 40 years of Gaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s dictatorship. And weekly demonstrations forced the King of Morocco to open up the political system and change his country\xe2\x80\x99s constitution. Suddenly, almost overnight, a calm and submissive region was boiling with popular demonstrations, overthrowing long-term, well-rooted dictatorships. Probably because the changes were unexpected and seemed to point to replace repression with freedom and tyranny with democracy, they were enthusiastically embraced by Western countries. The U.S. let Mubarak, a long term ally, fall without a blink of an eye, in order to show support to the people; and NATO engaged in a six month aerial campaign to help change the regime in Libya. Everything was so promising that the revolts shaking North Africa and the Gulf were termed ""the Arab Spring"" in the wake of the velvet revolutions that liberated central and eastern Europe from Soviet domination.

However, one stock stands out right now.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always held that Wynn  is the superior company; it has a stronger long-term story with fabulous management and unparalleled execution,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, right now, Las Vegas Sands  is the superior stock.\xe2\x80\x9dThe reason is what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in Asia, he said. Both companies get more than 75 percent of their earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization from Asia. A big chunk of that comes from Macau, the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest gambling destination and the only city in China where gambling is legal. But LVS has an \xe2\x80\x9cincredible catalyst\xe2\x80\x9d in the form of two new properties opening on the Cotai Strip, a massive project in Macau modeled after the Las Vegas strip. While Wynn is a \xe2\x80\x9cfabulous company\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cbetter management,\xe2\x80\x9d its Cotai properties won\xe2\x80\x99t open until at least 2014.Plus, Las Vegas Sands is the largest and most diversified gaming company in Macau and it is only one of two companies licensed to operate casinos in Singapore, where it has a resort.(Related: Online Gambling Exec Bets on Legalization)The company was downgraded to \xe2\x80\x98neutral\xe2\x80\x99 from \xe2\x80\x98buy\xe2\x80\x99 Thursday by Janney Montgomery, and that sent shares tumbling.

1726,Today in Tech: D-Day for HP and a Grand Opening for Apple,Tech Check,09-12-2011,"It's decision day for HP's webOS, opening day for Apple's Grand Central retail store, and a rough day for the electronics supply chain. Let's have a look at what's driving the sector: Texas Instruments gave a disappointing mid-quarterupdate yesterday that sent the stock down more than 2.5 percent at the open. The Q4 EPS range is now between $.21 $.25 per share, on sales between $3.19 billion and $3.33 billion. The previous range was 28 cents to 36 cents a share on $3.26 billion to $3.54 billion in revenue. The culprit? Weak demand across multiple categories that use TXN's analog chips. Of course, this probably says more about Q1 2012 for the rest of the industry than Q4. It is opening day for Apple's  huge store in New York's Grand Central Terminal. The stats: 23,000 square feet, 315 employees, and rent? 180 bucks per square foot for 10 years. Coming up later today around 4:30 on Closing Bell, I'll introduce you to Kiip, a startup run by fresh-faced Brian Wong, all of 20 years old. He's got a bright idea about how to reinvent in-game advertising by milking those moments when you feel like a winner. And, today at 1:30 eastern, HP  is holding an internal meeting revealing the fate of webOS, the long-suffering software it acquired with Palm. My take? The decision shouldn't be whether to keep webOS, but how to do it without breaking the bank. If HP's serious about the consumer market, owning its own intellectual property Is key. And with tablets like the iPad surging, HP's highly profitable printer revenue looks vulnerable in 2012. As more people buy tablets instead of PCs, they're also going to buy covers and cases (or 3G data plans) instead of printers. HP will need homegrown software to reinvent printing ... and to basically rethink the way information gets shared in the mobile era. No matter which way it goes, this will go down as a key decision from new HP CEO Meg Whitman. Share your thoughts -- hit me up on twitter @jonfortt. Have a great weekend.

Then \xe2\x80\x9cMad Money\xe2\x80\x9d host Jim Cramer suggests taking a look at SXC Health Solutions.SXC  is a pharmacy benefits manager that provides health care information technology. 90 percent of its sales and over 80 percent of its profits come from the benefits management division, which helps insurance companies and HMOs lower their drug costs. While SXC Health Solutions is not a big player in the PBM business, it has an edge because it makes the software systems used by many other PBMs. It sells its software to other pharmacy benefits managers, uses the technology to figure out which customers are doing well, and then either converts its smaller customers to their own existing PBM platform or acquires them. \xe2\x80\x9cThe business model feeds on itself as software clients become PBM takeover targets,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said.Plus, the future is looking good for SXC, he added. It is buying privately held pharmacy benefits manager HealthTrans for $250 million, which should bring in $270 million in revenues. HealthTrans also comes with a dozen information technology customers, of which SXC should be able to convert or acquire three or four. The company, like the rest of the PBM industry, will also benefit from the wave of generic drugs. So why is it a speculative play? Cramer said the risk is with its biggest\xc2\xa0 client, HealthSpring , which is being bought by Cigna . SXC still has four years left on its contract with HealthSpring. If Cigna cancels it, SXC will still get paid but it could cause SXC\xe2\x80\x99s earnings to take a hit. On the other hand, HealthSpring could convince Cigna to use them for all its PBM services, which would be huge for SXC.\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s a buy at these levels,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said, \xe2\x80\x9calthough if there\xe2\x80\x99s bad news on the Cigna front, that's going to knock the stock big, [and] then it might be a real terrific buying opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9dCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

1781,El-Erian: Neither a Quick Nor Comprehensive European Fix ,The Guest Blog,09-12-2011,"As a New York Jets fan, I despair of all the talk about the New England Patriots. Yes they have an amazing combination in Coach Belichick and Quarterback Brady; and yes they have incredibly talented tight ends and, in Wes Welker, one of the most dedicated players in football. But do I need to keep on hearing about it over and over again; and must I constantly worry about what the Patriots mean for the wellbeing of my Jets? I desperately want to wish the Patriots away, but I cannot. They matter. After all, the Jets are in the same division, we play them at least twice a year, and they often control our path to the playoffs. When it comes to Europe, investors around the world also face this exasperating combination of having, but not wishing to pay close attention. Every week, if not every day, Europe influences stocks, overwhelms sector-specific news, and frustrates careful security selection. The result is wave after wave of manic risk on and risk off days, together with spiking correlations and unsettling volatility. A week ago, markets were hoping that the combination of an ECB policy meeting and yet another Summit of European leaders would allow them to leave behind \xe2\x80\x94 not for a day or a week, but for months and quarters \xe2\x80\x94 the unsettling European cloud. Unfortunately, neither was decisive enough; and yet another golden opportunity was insufficiently exploited by European policymakers. Don't get me wrong, the two events did produce important results. Yet, given the scale and scope of the European crisis, they are not enough. Put differently, what came out is necessary but not sufficient. The ECB took bold steps to help banks facing crippling liquidity challenges. But it poured cold water on the notion that it was ready to go ""all in"" to stabilize the European sovereign debt problems. At their Summit, leaders provided the foundation for a potentially stronger and less imperfect Eurozone. But they did not go far enough in combining the emphasis on fiscal discipline with growth and jobs, together with real institutional robustness. Meanwhile, they opened what could well prove to be quite a destabilizing Pandora's box. British Prime Minister Cameron would have no part of the treaty changes proposed by his French and German counterparts. I suspect that this is a leading indicator of broader political strains that will get worse. Additional tensions are likely to surface as leaders return to their domestic constituencies and, importantly, as the Summit's broad agreements get translated into specifics. This is not only about stress between the 17 Eurozone countries and the 10 other members of the European Union (such as Britain) that are not members of the zone. It is also about frictions within each group. European leaders still need to do a lot more, and quickly, if they are to catch up and get ahead of the crisis. Accordingly, and regrettably, the specter of volatility caused by European headlines will not recede for long. Investors need to continue to watch and worry about Europe...and I have no choice but to continue to watch and worry about the Patriots.

1789,Oil to Drop Below $100 Easing Pressure on OPEC to Up Output: Survey,Energy,11-12-2011,"Benchmark crude oil prices may continue to drop below $100 a barrel, easing pressure on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise output at its meeting this Wednesday, CNBC's weekly survey showed.Still, prices remain elevated and may mean higher fuel bills for U.S. consumers, slowing the recovery in the world's largest economy. Meanwhile, Asian stock markets rallied Monday on hopes that an agreement involving 17 nations that use the Euro currency to tighten budget discipline may help resolve the region's debt crisis. However, many believe the ""resolution euphoria"" won't last, though others are more confident that it has laid the groundwork for a lasting solution. Andrew Economos, Head of Sovereign & Institutional Strategy Asia at JPMorgan, described the pace of progress towards a fiscal compact on Friday as ""lightspeed...a breakthrough by European standards."" This should generate a risk-on rally in the short term though he warned of a pullback in January or February as the markets refocused on recessionary fears.On the flipside, Andrew Pease, Investment Strategist at Russell Investments noted this morning that Italian bond yields over 6.5 percent suggest Friday's EU leaders' summit, and their agreements on tighter budget oversight, has ""done nothing fundamentally"" to change the debt crisis.On balance, most of this week's survey sample group agreed with Pease's assessment. Five, or exactly half, of the week's sample group of 10 respondents said prices would fall this week, four said they would rise while one said prices would remain unchanged.""The crisis will not be gone by next week,"" said Excel Futures' Mark Waggoner on Friday. ""Crude oil will not sustain these levels for long. Correction lower is inevitable.""But Peter Turville-Ince at Compass Global Markets maintained his bullish call on the basis of the progress he believed European leaders had made at last Friday's summit towards tighter fiscal discipline.""Oil should benefit substantially from Friday's outcome as traders can now place less emphasis on Europe in the short-term and focus more on the positive news we are seeing in the U.S.,"" he said. ""All the market needed was some sort of a framework or guide to what will be done and how we will achieve these outcomes and this is exactly what we got. There may be flaws in the plan but in the end this framework should act to restore some investor confidence and remove some of the uncertainty that has been present.""He added: ""Economic data is improving in the U.S. and University of Michigan consumer sentiment data on Friday clearly showed that optimism is starting to return in the U.S. economy and if we see jobs data continue to improve as it has been of late we could see a very big end of year rally in equity markets which would push crude prices well over the $100 mark."" A move to the $105-$110 band by year-end was possible, Turville-Ince said, if concerns over an Iranian oil embargo escalate and as long as U.S. data continues to improve. ""Any pullbacks have been very well supported and we feel that any dips below $100 are a great buying opportunity as long as support at $97.50 holds in the short-term."" Demand Destruction?Crude oil's  march back above $100 has yet to feed through to retail gasoline prices in the U.S. On average, prices for regular gasoline in the U.S. fell 8.89 cents to $3.2918 a gallon in the two-week period ended December 2, according to influential Lundberg Survey.The International Energy Agency on Monday said a boost in Saudi oil production would provide ""welcome"" relief to rising oil prices, warning continuing price hikes threatened to thwart global economic recovery efforts.""OECD stock levels are at historically low levels, plus we are in a very fragile economic recovery situation,"" IEA chief economist Fatih Birol told a seminar. ""And the higher prices than we have now can strangle economic recovery efforts worldwide, therefore the Saudi production boost currently and in the future will be very welcome,"" he told a seminar.A senior Saudi oil official told Reuters last week the kingdom produced 10.047 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil excluding condensate in November, the highest rate for decades. From a technical perspective, Dhiren Sarin, Barclays Capital's Chief Technical Strategist - Asia-Pac, said prices could pull-back as investors remain reluctant to redeploy money back into risk assets.""We expect choppy ranges to persist across markets as investors stay reluctant to put on risk,"" Sarin said. ""For crude oil, this likely leads to a drift lower within range as WTI crude makes its way back towards the $94/95 area, continuing to unwind its overbought extremes seen at the November peak. Range highs near the $103.40/$104.60 area remain a difficult barrier to overcome for the time being.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/11/oil-to-drop-below-100-easing-pressure-on-opec-to-up-output-survey.html

1798,Cramer: These 'Disappointers' Now Work,Mad Money,12-12-2011,"Stocks tumbled Monday, triggered by concerns that Europe was far from resolving its debt crisis. The Dow sunk 163 points, the S&P gave up 1.5 percent and the NASDAQ declined 1.3 percent. But there are themes that are working, even in this perilous market, \xe2\x80\x9cMad Money\xe2\x80\x9d host Jim Cramer said.\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to be clever about what this market really wants,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cRisk on, risk off is for the non-homework doing gunners who will far more than likely make no money at all.\xe2\x80\x9dCramer has repeatedly said that this market likes dividend-yielding stocks and master limited partnerships.

Before the rash of semiconductor related blow-ups, it was the food group who produced the most disappointments quarter after quarter. Yet while a vast majority of this group failed to meet their estimates or had their projections cut, their stocks have come roaring back.For example:ConAgra Foods  reported a \xe2\x80\x9cnauseating quarter\xe2\x80\x9d on September 20. The stock, however, has since climbed back up. McCormick  delivered weak gross margins and Credit Suisse said \xe2\x80\x9cNot Thyme to Buy the Stock.\xe2\x80\x9d However, the stock has since moved higher.Kellogg  was downgraded to \xe2\x80\x98hold\xe2\x80\x99 from \xe2\x80\x98buy\xe2\x80\x99 by Deutsche Bank, yet shares are back up.Heinz , perhaps the worst of the group, had disappointing sales. It bottomed and has been climbing up.Campbell Soup  reported \xe2\x80\x9chorrible\xe2\x80\x9d sales but shares recovered and are now higher.Tyson Foods  had a \xe2\x80\x9ctotal miss.\xe2\x80\x9d The stock, however, has since headed higher. The reason, Cramer said is that companies are doing better because their commodity costs are coming down. \xe2\x80\x9cIt tells you that a European slowdown doesn't make all stocks unattractive \xe2\x80\xa6 it actually makes some stocks more attractive than others, like the food group,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cEspecially since many of these companies have put through price increases that are sticking at the same time that the raw costs are coming down.\xe2\x80\x9dCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

1811,"Yoshikami: Europe; Panic, and Disaster ",The Guest Blog,12-12-2011,"Last week's headlines were dominated by European leaders meetingto try to finally develop a coordinated strategy to address the fiscal woes of the European Union\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign nations. As usual, Germany and Francetook the lead in attempting to forge a closer financial bond to alter the negative sentiment about European financial conditions. While many have talked about the possibility of the European Union breaking up, leaders are proposing an even stronger union with strict financial controls in place to assure members that all countries play by the same rules. We support this proposal but wonder why this wasn't part of the European Union in the first place. Behind the scenes, the goal is to break the back of speculators attempting to short the euro and drive the European Union to financial ruin. This is no different than the speculation that occurred in 2008 when short-sellers attempted to crash the U.S. economy during the Lehman crisis. Traders have attempted to crash JP Morgan  and Goldman Sachs and they are not done yet. What many investors do not recognize is that the incredible volatility that we see on a regular basis is not based on fundamentals, but is instead based on high momentum trading designed to create a liquidity crisis. And when a liquidity crisis emerges, short sellers are often rewarded by betting on negative sentiment. In essence, the current market swing development is due to a massive element of contrived panic. The media does not help because of the short news reporting cycle. As a result, most investors are bewildered and negatively impacted by market swings and hysteria. While one might be tempted to be outraged at the games being played in the market by institutional speculators, such consternation really won\xe2\x80\x99t help; it's not going to change. The reality is that the market is driven by investing and trading, and traders drive a significant percentage of revenue for exchanges and brokerage companies. Like it or not, a free enterprise market allows for yelling fire in a crowded movie theater. As investors, recognize that euphoria and panic may happen on a regular basis. Take into account sentiment; one cannot ignore emotion when investing. But one cannot be SUBJECT to emotion when making decisions. Rational thinking is required. It's not always easy, but maintaining a clear perspective is the best way to move towards long-term investment success. The market will never stabilize; it is what it is. And with the shorts attempting to pile on every minute (and second), volatility is here to stay. Like it or not, that's the world we live in.

1813,5 Worst Stocks of the Year\xe2\x80\x94Which Are 'Buys' for 2012?,CNBC Stock Blog,12-12-2011,"The Standard & Poor's 500 Index of the biggest U.S. stocks is barely break-even this year and there are many shares underperforming the broader market.Some of the weakest companies are being plagued by a limp economy, intense competition and poor leadership. Those stocks will take time to recover from their 2011 lows, especially given that the economy at home and abroad \xe2\x80\x94 in Europe and China, especially \xe2\x80\x94 is going down.And for stocks with company-specific issues, there won't be an overnight turnaround.Of the bottom five stocks, I recommend only one: coal-mining company Alpha Natural Resources. The stock is poised to rebound in 2012 as the integration of an acquisition takes hold in 2012 and coal prices increase.Details on the worst stocks of the S&P 500 are below. You'll want to stay away from most of them in 2012.5. Alpha Natural Resources Company Profile: Alpha Natural Resources is an Appalachian coal supplier. 2011 Stock Performance: minus 59 percent. What went wrong: The acquisition of Massey Energy after its tragic mine accident in 2010 is taking longer than expected to integrate and costing more, causing investors to question the acquisition.Concerns over an economic slowdown in the U.S. and Europe also weigh on the stock.Is it worth owning in 2012? Many analysts argue that the stock has been unfairly beaten down. As Massey Energy is consolidated, its profits will improve and the realization of savings ($150 million in 2012) will provide support for the stock.Plus, U.S. coal contract prices are up from last year, which will help profitability. I recommend buying this stock in 2012.4. Netflix\xc2\xa0 Company Profile: Netflix  provides subscription-based Internet services for TV shows and movies in the United States and internationally.2011 Stock Performance: minus 59 percent What went wrong: The largest problem for the company was a 60% price hike to its popular DVD-by-mail and streaming service.The result: Netflix lost 9 million DVD customers since June. In addition, the company's aggressive international expansion is producing losses.Is it worth owning in 2012? The direction CEO Reed Hastings has taken the company over the past year has resulted in a damaged brand image, and his leadership style has become concerning.Increasing competition \xe2\x80\x94 Verizon  being the latest \xe2\x80\x94 will continue and Netflix now has to prove its ability to compete and regain customers. Stay away from Netflix in 2012.3. MEMC Electronic Materials\xc2\xa0 Company Profile: MEMC Electronic  is a maker of silicon used in computer chips and solar panels.2011 Stock Performance: minus 63 percentWhat went wrong: Declining solar-panel prices has torched the stock. Suntech Power Holdings  canceled its supply agreement with MEMC in July, which was to last through 2016.Recently, MEMC announced plans to reduce its workforce by 20 percent, idle a plant in Italy and make other cost-cutting plans.Is it worth owning in 2012? Prices have declined substantially over the past four years and are expected to continue the downward trend. It will be hard for MEMC Electronics to compete in this type of environment.2012 will be a difficult year and, as such, I would not buy MEMC Electronics' shares.2. First Solar Company Profile: First Solar  makes solar-power systems.2011 Stock Price Performance: minus 63 percent What went wrong: Price wars on solar panels, dependency on government subsidies, and uncertainty around demand from Europe have put pressure on First Solar's stock.Competition in the solar-panel arena is high, and many analysts are anticipating consolidation. At the end of October, Chief Executive Officer Rob Gillette left the company.Is it worth owning in 2012? Two important headwinds will deter a near-term recovery \xe2\x80\x94 reduced government tax incentives and customer financing. First Solar is viewed as one of the better stocks in the industry, but weak demand will prevent upside for some time.Steer clear of this stock in 2012.1. Monster WorldwideCompany Profile: Online employment services company.2011 Stock Performance: minus 67.5 percentWhat went wrong: Monster Worldwide  has been hurt by a weak job market. As the company's North American business has begun to show improvement, profitability has struggled to follow suit.Declining U.S. margins have taken a toll on the stock. Increased competition from social networks like LinkedIn , Facebook and Craigslist has also weighed on Monster.Is it worth owning in 2012? International growth out of the U.K. and Germany will slow from the 30%-plus growth reported over the past two quarters.Monster is also having a hard time profiting from an improving environment in the U.S., especially given its higher cost structure versus competition.While insiders, including the CEO and CFO, have been buying shares signaling they believe the stock is undervalued, I recommend avoiding this stock in 2012.Additional News: Cable, Netflix Should Fear Verizon's Web PlansAdditional Views: Worst Not Over for Stocks, but Time to Sift for Bargains: Experts__________________________CNBC Data Pages:Dow 30 Stocks\xe2\x80\x94In Real Time Oil, Gold, Natural Gas Prices Now Where's the US Dollar Today?Track Treasury Prices Here______________________________ Disclosures:TheStreet's editorial policy prohibits staff editors, reporters and analysts from holding positions in any individual stocks.Disclaimer",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/12/5-worst-stocks-of-the-yearwhich-are-buys-for-2012.html
1814,Fratto: The Trouble With Tim Tebow (And the Economics of NFL Quarterbacks) ,The Guest Blog,12-12-2011,"Tim Tebow, the Denver Broncos starting quarterback, led yet another come-from-behindvictory on Sunday. It was the sixth straight win for the team that reluctantly turned over the reins to Tebow after a faltering start.At the risk of enraging his true believer fanatics, let me repeat the conclusion of nearly every professional scout who ever rated the young quarterback: Tebow is not skilled in the art of passing. His ability to read a defense is suspect. His mechanics are inefficient. His accuracy is lacking. He hasn't demonstrated an ability to hit a moving target. But those aren't the real problems with Tebow.Tim Tebow \xe2\x80\x94 as any coach, fan, or scout will also conclude \xe2\x80\x94 is undeniably a winner and leader. He has mental strength, a positive outlook, a will to win \xe2\x80\x94 and, importantly, what he lacks in passing skills, he makes up for with size, power, and speed. He's a gifted ""heads-up"" runner who sees the field best when on the move. So what's the real problem with Tebow? There's only one of him. Not because he's been divinely sent to teach us all about the power of positive thinking and never giving up. (Note that both the young T.J. Yates of the Houston Texans and New York Giants' veteran Eli Manning also led their teams to thrilling last-minute wins yesterday. God was indifferent.) No, the problem is the Broncos are building an offensive system to take advantage of Tim Tebow's very specific style and skills \xe2\x80\x94 relying on Tebow's ability to run, and receivers running routes to better accommodate Tebow's limited passing abilities. With an entire system and game plan built around Tebow, the Broncos are one injury away from disaster. (Yes, we'll eventually learn he is, after all, human.) In short, it's a concentrated risk. The reason NFL teams tend to avoid these athletes (or turn them into wide receivers) is money. The single most valuable position on a professional football team is the starting quarterback, with the ball in his hands on every offensive play. Good ones are stars, and stars command huge long-term contracts well north of $100 million including mammoth signing bonuses. You don't invest tens of millions of dollars in a quarterback and then let him run around the field susceptible to bone-crushing hits by linebackers. So you protect him in a pocket by offensive linemen. It's why the ""option"" offense is incompatible with the NFL. The iron-clad law of NFL economics demands that quarterbacks must be ""pocket passers"". The pattern of transition from run-pass college quarterback to pro-style pocket passer has been accomplished with varying degrees of success. In the 1970s, Terry Bradshaw \xe2\x80\x94 a bruising runner with a cannon for an arm \xe2\x80\x94 struggled for years before becoming the pocket QB we remember winning four Super Bowls with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Kordell Stewart, another Steelers quarterback in the 1990s, was so talented an athlete he excelled at wide receiver, earning the nickname ""Slash"", before becoming the team's quarterback and put in the pocket. Stewart never really succeeded as a pocket-passing quarterback, despite the Steelers' efforts to adjust their system to his passing deficiencies, much like the Broncos with Tebow. Most often, running QBs never even get a look as a quarterback in the NFL. The Philadelphia Eagles' experience with Michael Vickthis season is an experience with concentrated risk. Vick is perhaps the best athlete in the NFL \xe2\x80\x94 very strong, with sprinter's speed, outrageous stop quickness, and an effortlessly strong arm. But Vick's running ability also exposes him to hits. While some of Vick's injuries occurred in the pocket this year, his absence (and playing injured) contributed to the Eagles dismal season. Moreover, we as fans rarely get to see Vick's incredible athletic gifts on display. The Broncos aren't taking a risk by playing Tebow; they're taking a risk by only having one of him. The Broncos have an opportunity to rock NFL economics \xe2\x80\x94 and NFL defenses \xe2\x80\x94 by going ""all in"", not on Tim Tebow, but on the Tebow system. If the Broncos want to play Tebow's system, then find six other quarterbacks just like him. (I know, Tebow fans think there's only the One. They're wrong.) Supremely gifted athletes not suited to pocket-passing pro-style systems are actually available in abundance in the college ranks today, not to mention those already in the NFL playing receiver positions. They run brilliantly, catch well enough to earn NFL jobs as receivers, and can pass adequately -- especially in full-blown Tebow system. Most important for NFL's economic system: they're cheap. Supply is very high; the demand for their QB skills is very low. The Broncos could afford to populate their entire offensive backfield and receiver corps with these triple-threat athletes, and probably for less than it costs for a typical star QB and backup. And then? Have some fun! With backups aplenty, the Broncos can run the Tebow offense and open up the game in ways we haven't seen in the NFL for decades: use the run option, use the pass option, run flea-clickers and reverses with all of them! My advice to the Broncos: stick with Tebow. Stick with the Tebow system. But go all in \xe2\x80\x94 have some fun, save some money, eliminate your concentrated Tebow risk, and turn the NFL upside down! That would really be Tebow Time.

Here's how to get ready.Time for a Swiss watch. (Sorry.) The Swiss National Bank is meeting this Thursday to assess monetary policy, and officials there have indicated they are concerned about the franc's  continuing strength. Investors sure seem to be on the alert for some kind of move to bring the franc back to earth. Leveraged funds flipped to short positions in the Swiss franc over the past week - the first time that has happened in 13 months, according to Greg Anderson, senior G10 FX strategist at Citigroup. Richard Cochinos and John Hopkinson, analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, calculate that the market is assigning a 25% probability to the euro-  Swiss franc floor being raised to 1.25 - a minority view, but still. There is even some talk that the bank could set a floor of 1.30. Predicting central bank moves is a tough game, but you can watch one off-the-beaten path indicator. The Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts say that Swiss National Bank officials play close attention to the micro survey of Swiss business that appears in the bank's quarterly bulletin. ""Weakening of foreign demand and the deterioration of companies\xe2\x80\x99 earnings have negative feedback loops on investment, employment and private expenditure. Hence, the SNB tracks the results closely,"" they wrote in a note to clients.

1830,Home Buyers Could Pay for Payroll-Tax Cut,Realty Check,12-12-2011,"At face value, it seems like an easy, albeit creative way to pay for the extension of the payroll tax cut. Raise the fees that banks pay mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to guarantee home loans. These are called \xe2\x80\x9cguarantee fees,\xe2\x80\x9d and are supposed to cover mortgage defaults in a normal housing market. (I say this because obviously in today\xe2\x80\x99s foreclosure-ridden landscape they don\xe2\x80\x99t even come close, which is why the two are currently in debt to U.S. taxpayers for a collective $152.7 billion).But back to the original premise: Senate Democrats and House Republicans like the idea, which under the Senate proposal would raise $38.1 billion, according to Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey. Senate and House versions differ on how much the fees would be raised, but both proposals are additions of less than one percent of the loan. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is one of those ideas that manages to attract support from the left and the right because on the right they love the idea of raising the cost of using Fannie and Freddie, because that could bring the private sector back to the mortgage market.

1840,Crouch: The Day The Euro Died ,The Guest Blog,12-12-2011,"While most have dubbed the products of the European Union Summitas further \xe2\x80\x98kicking the can down the road,\xe2\x80\x99 I believe the outcome portends the end of the Euro currencyas we now know it. My reasoning goes well beyond the questions engendered by the actions and comes full circle to the realization that, far from getting what she wanted, Germany\xe2\x80\x99s leader Angela Merkel agreed to provisions, which she knows full well her countryman will never accept when push comes to shove. And trust me, push is coming to shove very soon. At the core of the intolerable elements of the agreement are two intertwined provisions; that private investors are not expected to take losses on unsustainable sovereign debts and the European Central Bank  (ECB) effectively channels support for challenged national debt complexes through the IMF and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the permanent successor to the temporary European Financial Stability Facility. In de-facto \xe2\x80\x98monetizing\xe2\x80\x99 the credit support mechanisms and preventing the \xe2\x80\x98market\xe2\x80\x99 to exact any risk-reward measures from investors, to central tenets of Ms. Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s multi-year protestations, I believe the so called agreements seal the fate of the Euro. That Germany will exit is now a virtual certainty, to my mind. When this will occur is sooner than most likely think possible. A matter of a few months is my best guess. Now for the whys and wherefores. Let us start with the hubris the Germans have displayed from the beginnings of the Crisis. As some, myself included, have pointed out the effective imbalances in the Euro, which greatly benefited Germany, and its powerful export economy from the inception of the common currency in 1999, the Germans have never believed this has been so. They simply believe all the troubles stem from a severe lack of financial rectitude on the part of the now struggling members of the Eurozone. If only they had controlled themselves from a fiscal perspective and acted with prudence, we would not be in this mess. That is the common refrain overwhelmingly heard throughout the German populous and institutions. Polls support this notion. That there are some severe structural imbalances, which have rendered the so called \xe2\x80\x98peripherals\xe2\x80\x99 very uncompetitive, is not just ignored, but patently rejected in Germany. Since these beliefs are deeply ingrained in the German psyche, the Germans will form a new version of the Euro when the inevitable bill comes due. And the bill will come due. And it will be very large. The resignation of a number of high profile German officials from the ECB over the bank\xe2\x80\x99s intervention in the markets through the bond buying program the ECB engaged in under the previous Director Jean-Claude Trichetis a visible clue of German attitudes toward the support of the debt markets through ECB \xe2\x80\x98monetization\xe2\x80\x99 and what I call, \xe2\x80\x98collectivization\xe2\x80\x99 of the debts. After all, if the whole of the EZ support the bonds of individual member states, does not allow for market risks to be borne by investors and provides for direct purchases of less creditworthy issuers, it renders the collective actually \xe2\x80\x98on the hook\xe2\x80\x99 for each others debts. This condition is patently unacceptable to the Germans, regardless of the agreements at hand. Speaking of agreements, I believe the agreements that will emerge sometime in March will be crafted in very deliberately to allow for the exit of the parties currently in the common currency known as the Euro. Further, I believe that the joint announcement from the EU Summit is but a staged media event very much meant for public consumption. The break has now been made and the ceremonies and pronouncements are all strictly for show. I knew this once Ms. Merkel gave up her two central tenets. Of course, those tenets being no private participation in losses and the collective EZ mechanisms acting as \xe2\x80\x98lender of last resort\xe2\x80\x99. Additionally, there are a couple of \xe2\x80\x98details\xe2\x80\x99 lacking in all this. Chief among them are: How much supposed funding \xe2\x80\x98firepower\xe2\x80\x99 is actually being made available for support? Specifically, where is the funding coming from? What are the terms of both funding and repayment? What is the timeframe of the various components of the \xe2\x80\x98fix?\xe2\x80\x99 Besides Britain, who else will bail on it BEFORE the documents are prepared in March 2012? And the big one: What happens should some participants not receive the needed mandates at home? From my perspective, Germany just answered these and many other questions. Besides Finland,Luxembourg, Austria and Holland, the rest of the World will find out soon enough. Stanley J. G.

That\xe2\x80\x99s great news for these firms.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9dAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s the other big component for these firms?"" Cortes asks. ""It\xe2\x80\x99s wages. And wages are also depressed. I see the current environment as a very good environment for these stocks; as well as other low-priced food purveyors and coffee stores.\xe2\x80\x9dHowever, if you're not already in these names, Cortes wouldn't establish new positions just yet. He thinks the market is due for a broad pullback.\xc2\xa0 But on a dip, he's a buyer.Trader Stephen Weiss is on the other side - at least when it comes to McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s only so much they can grow sales. Looking at their international business. I think the weaker euro is going to hurt their bottom line.\xe2\x80\x9d Yum however, may be a different story because it has less exposure to Europe. Weiss sees Yum as primarily a play on the US and China, where most of their stores are. \xe2\x80\x9cThis one can keep growing,\xe2\x80\x9d says Weiss.In case you're wondering on Monday's Fast at 5, trader Guy Adami said much the same - stick with what's working - names like MCD and Yum - that is if you\xe2\x80\x99re a trader. However, if you\xe2\x80\x99re a retail investor who isn\xe2\x80\x99t nimble, Karen Finerman had words of caution. ""If you don't trade in and out of positions, long MCD and Yum! may not be for you. For both the drivers have been overseas growth \xe2\x80\x93 if that slows I think both stocks have extra room to fall.\xe2\x80\x9d----------------------------------------------------------------------> NEW SLIDESHOW: Slo-o-o-w Money, 10 Top Stocks for the Long-Term Investor----------------------------------------------------------------------______________________________________________________Got something to to say?

1897,How Bad Is the Euro? Ask Iceland,Money in Motion,13-12-2011,"Iceland's Progressive Party wants to stop trying to join the euro and adopt the Canadian dollar instead.Just in case you've been wondering how big a mess Europe is really in, the folks who imploded a little Northern economy have an idea. Iceland has toyed with idea of joining the euro  for a number of years, but after the krona  plummeted during the country's economic implosion in 2008, the idea gained more urgency. Now the tiny nation has an application pending to join the euro. But the Progressive Parry - a minority party in Iceland, but still - is arguing that the Canadian dollar  is a safer bet. The idea was first reported in Canadian Business, and it has since been gaining ground. Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson, leader of the Progressive Parry, has been quoted describing the Canadian dollar as ""very promising."" (It doesn't hurt that Iceland is at odds with the European Union over fishing rights and whaling.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Bank of Canada simply says it will be glad to sell Iceland all the loonies it wants. But currency experts say it wouldn't be hard for Iceland to make the switch. Also, both countries have commodity-linked economies - fish in Iceland's case, oil and more in Canada's - along with a highly educated and relatively affluent populace. And of course, there's the snow and ice.

1908,Johnson: Five Questions You Should Ask Your Financial Adviser ,The Guest Blog,13-12-2011,"The canvass of investment planning has been subject to a variety of hues absent from the traditional 24 color Crayola box. Industries evolve, rules of thumb lose their grip on what\xe2\x80\x99s considered suitable and unannounced complexities require a different brand of expertise from those providing advice. As a consequence, most financial advisers have successfully expanded their body of knowledge to include the sharp edges on new pieces of a familiar puzzle. Investors would be wise to verify this transition with a few quick questions. 1. How will you mitigate the risks posed by Europe? The subprime market peaked at $1.5 trillion, but the outstanding debt of peripheral European nations is valued at $4.6 trillion. Moreover,\xe2\x82\xac519 billionof French, Italian and German obligations come due in the first half of 2012, a year in which European banks must refinance a trillion Euros and will compete for capital. European banks not only have tremendous exposure to distressed sovereign debt, but have sold \xe2\x82\xac178 billionin credit default swaps to investors who are intent on hedging their holdings. And while these same banks have purchased a corresponding amount of insurance on said exposure, counterparty risk would likely create inefficiencies during the midst of a crisis and invalidate their protection. Your adviser should understand these dynamics and have a reasonable game plan to protect your assets in the event of a disorderly default. 2. What long-term impact might the central banks have on the financial markets? The expressed purpose of a central bank is to monitor the supply of money, curtail inflation and reduce fluctuations in the business cycle. During the last several years, however, they have become the lender of last resort and now find themselves intimately involved in preventing the financial markets from further shocks. The side effects of loose monetary policy can be profound and basic knowledge of central banking activity is now a required skill set for financial service professionals. 3. Have you amended your asset allocation strategy over the last ten years, and if so, why? There was a time when traditional asset classes were non-correlated and shielded investors from risk during periods of extreme volatility. Unfortunately, they are now ill-suited for risk management, moving in the same direction regardless of market conditions. Few workers could perform their job function without email, a cell phone and the internet - why would investors accept an asset allocation that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed in 20 years? 4. How will inflation affect my quality of life? If the CPI was calculated today in the same manner as it was 30 years ago, inflation would be almost 10 percent. Furthermore, bonds may be referred to as fixed income, but expenses are hardly static. In addition, should artificially low interest rates begin to rise in response to depreciated currency values, bond prices will decline accordingly. Stocks have historically been effective at preserving purchasing power, but as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over the previous decade, that script is dire need of your adviser\xe2\x80\x99s editing abilities. 5. What are the last three books you\xe2\x80\x99ve read? Financial advisers cannot possibly navigate the cavernous gallery of derivatives, correlations, central banking activity and government policy in between client meetings, administrative requirements, return phone calls and other professional demands. Internal research departments can offer support, although now might be a bad time for your adviser to completely outsource his/her ability to reason. Long held investment strategies are suddenly in question, as the foundation of the global economy shifts like sand. Financial advisers don\xe2\x80\x99t need a PhD in economics, although the majority have an educated opinion based on empirical evidence and a firm grasp of macroeconomic principles. Make sure yours is amongst them. Expensive suits and a smooth sales pitch are awfully impressive, and it sure is nice to have a local office at your disposal, it's just that great presentations don't always ensure competence. The person you\xe2\x80\x99ve chosen to manage your money has in all likelihood mastered their craft. Nevertheless, an updated version of due diligence is probably in order. Ivory Johnson, CFP, ChFC, is the director of financial planning at Scarborough Capital Management, Inc. and has over 20 years of investment experience. Mr. Johnson attended Penn State University, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in finance.

1909,Want Drivers Not to Be Distracted? Jam Their Cell Phones,Behind the Wheel with Phil Lebeau,13-12-2011,"Before you fire an e-mail off to me claiming I need to get a clue, ask yourself this question: back before we had cell phones, what was it like driving a car?I ask this because I am increasingly of the belief that the only way to keep drivers off the phone is to jam their cell signals when they are in the driver's seat. If we've learned anything over the last 10-15 years, it's become clear that the problem of distracted drivingis not just whether the driver is holding phone and texting, dialing, or surfing the internet for an updated sports score. This issue is whether the driver is distracted. And that distraction happens even when you are not holding a phone. Need proof? Last year 3,092 people were killed in distraction related accidents In recommending the complete banon drivers using electronic devices (including use of hands free cell phones), the NTSB is not suggesting the cell phone signals of drivers be jammed.

1938,Heckmann CEO Downplays Fracking Concerns,Mad Money,14-12-2011,"Days after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said fluids used to drill for natural gas likely polluted an aquifer in Wyoming, an industry leader on Wednesday suggested it maybe an isolated incident.\xe2\x80\x9cIt was just bad handling of the water at the surface. It has nothing to do with fracking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heckmann Corp.  CEO Dick Heckmann, who promoted hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, as way to boost U.S. gas and oil production and slash imports. In fracking, drillers blast large amounts of water, chemicals and sand deep underground to crack rocks that hold the fuel. Industry groups have said that fracking has been used for decades without ever polluting water supplies, because the drilling occurs far below the water sources such as aquifers.\xe2\x80\x9cYou frack at 10,000 feet [underground and] water seeps down,\xe2\x80\x9d Heckmann explained. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seep up.\xe2\x80\x9dThe fracking process uses a lot of water, too. Heckmann said about 8,000 gallons are used in each well and afterward, all of that water has to come back up. Some of it can be reused, but most of it is too salty \xe2\x80\x93 roughly five times as salty as ocean water. Heckmann has pipeline and other equipment that disposes of the frac fluid and saltwater. It goes into disposal holes far underground and in places like Pennsylvania, where deep holes for disposal cannot be drilled, Heckmann said the water is coming to the surface in the middle of oilfields where it evaporates.Heckmann also addressed concerns of a water shortage, arguing it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more than an \xe2\x80\x9cold wives\xe2\x80\x99 tale.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no shortage of water. It is an allocation of water,\xe2\x80\x9d Heckmann explained, noting fracking uses about 1.4 percent of the water available, not including the oceans while farming uses 47 percent. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is plenty of water \xe2\x80\xa6 look around, there is water everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9dHeckmann admitted there is a slight water shortage in the Eagle Ford shale of South Texas, but he pointed out that much of the water is recycled.Read on for Cramer's Top Energy Plays(RELATED\xe2\x80\x94Wyoming Frack Storm Shows Need for Better Regulation: Kemp)\xe2\x80\x94Reuters contributed to this reportCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

Going forward, Cramer thinks the market will still be handcuffed to Europe\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing debt problems. If the Italian bank can\xe2\x80\x99t get funding, the Italians will be forced to nationalize the bank and Cramer thinks there could be a run on other banks. In turn, he thinks there could be more nationalizations that cause interest rates in Italy and elsewhere to spike. All of this, he said, would force Germany and France to finally take action.\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, all of this could have been prevented if the Europeans had only offered a credible plan for both the sovereign debtor nations as well as the banks that own their bonds, instead of just focusing on the banks,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer commented, adding that either way, he thinks the markets will survive the hard times ahead. He thinks the markets will suffer in the short-term, though, and he would sell financials when possible.

Real estate construction accounted for around 13 percent of gross domestic product last year and a quarter of total investment.Mr Li urged the government to provide more support to first-time homebuyers and to loosen lending policies and purchase restrictions.Most analysts expect the government to reverse many of its restrictions if prices fall more than 25 percent over the next year, but some worry Beijing may wait too long to reverse course for fear of losing credibility.Communist officials were scheduled to wrap up a three-day meeting on the economy on Wednesday, during which the central government was expected to come under intense pressure to ease property restrictions. Last week the politburo, the party\xe2\x80\x99s top decision-making body, set the tone for the meeting by emphasizing that current policies would be maintained to bring housing prices down to \xe2\x80\x9cnormal levels\xe2\x80\x9d.",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/13/beijing-under-pressure-to-bolster-housing-sector.html

1998,"Farr: Santa, Greece Has Been Naughty!",The Guest Blog,15-12-2011,"A recent Washington Post article discusses the latest report on Greece from the International Monetary Fund, IMF,. The report, spearheaded by IMF Greece mission chief Poul Thomsen, was apparently quite critical of the Greeks for their lack of follow-through on previous promises. According to the Post, ""Thomsen cast the blame squarely on Greek officials' slowness in carrying out their pledges to reform economic policy and government spending. Those politically painful steps involve selling off state enterprises, firing tens of thousands of politically connected state employees and removing jealously guarded protections that limit competition in dozens of professions."" Herein lays the crux of the European problem. Although most of the other troubled European countriesmay not have the same degree of tax evasion and nepotism that Greece has, each of these countries will be forced to implement painful reforms that are likely to endanger the jobs of many European politicians. None of these lessons should be lost in the US either. Greece is the test case for what may eventually happen throughout Southern Europe, including the much larger economies of Italy, Spain and Portugal. And while other countries may not be carrying the same level of debt, relative to GDP , as Greece, these other countries will also not get the same ""voluntary"" deal for a 50% reduction in privately held bonds outstanding that Greece, at this point, is likely to enjoy.So the questions remain, how does a government implement painful spending cuts and somehow retain enough support to remain in office long enough to carry out the plans? And perhaps more importantly, what will happen to aggregate economic growth in the event that multiple countries implement sharp spending cuts simultaneously? This is exactly why so many pundits are pessimistic about the European situation. Lots of stuff needs to go right in order to get to the other side of this crisis. First, austerity plans must be implemented and carried out across multiple countries without major governmental disruption and social unrest. And second, nobody knows the impact that simultaneous spending cuts across Europe will have on the aggregate European economy. The Greek economy is expected to shrink about 6% this year - more than double the amount expected at the inception of the bailout program in May 2010. In addition, the economy will continue contracting next year compared to an original expectation for a return to positive growth. The Post quoted Thomsen as saying ""Reforms have fallen short. They are well behind schedule. They are well away from the critical mass that would make people conclude Greece is doing business in a fundamentally different way, and that is the main reason the bottoming out of the recession has not happened."" But is it realistic to think that had the reforms (ie, spending cuts) been implemented as planned, the Greek economy would be back on track to grow again in 2012? It does not seem very likely to me, especially when the rest of the continent is shrinking at the same time. I am all for biting the bullet, ripping off the band-aid, jumping on the grenade, etc, etc. However, in this case, it seems that the IMF and the markets should be careful what they wish for. The famous economist John Maynard Keynes argued that in times of weak economic growth, governments should step in and increase spending in an effort to prime the economic pump. If Keynes were alive today, he would undoubtedly argue that sharp, simultaneous cuts in public spending across large swaths of the European economy could very likely cause bigger problems than many people fully appreciate. A mild downturn could turn into an ugly recession very quickly. The point is that in Greece, the rest of Europe, and the United States, spending cuts are necessary. If cuts are implemented too aggressively, recessions will result. If cuts are too mild, Reinhart and Rogoff\xe2\x80\x99s study, \xe2\x80\x9cThis Time is Different: A Panoramic View of Eight Centuries of Financial Crises,\xe2\x80\x9d shows that debt will reach levels that stifle growth and can cause equally deep recessions that may last a long time. Striking a proper balance is the key. Errors, in our opinion, should favor the \xe2\x80\x9caggressive\xe2\x80\x9d end of the cutting scale. Though potentially more painful, the sooner markets are allowed to clear, the better.\xc2\xa0 This post was also written by Keith B. Davis, CFA. Michael K.

2022,"iPad 3 Rumors: What We Know, Don't Know, and Think We Know",U.S. News,15-12-2011,"IPad 3 rumors increasingly suggest that the new Apple tablet will hit shelves in early 2012 \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps even as soon as February. The iPad 2, of course, with its dual-cameras and upgraded innards, represented a sizable leap forward from the original iPad. So what kind of improvements can we expect from the iPad 3? A caveat: Apple's notorious secrecy makes such hypothesizing both fun and \xe2\x80\x93 in its own way \xe2\x80\x93 futile. Still, there's plenty of information out there, some of it probable, some of it doubtful, and some of it a little silly. Let's break it down.As we noted yesterday, Citi analyst Richard Gardner recently penned a note to investors, forecasting the arrival of the new iPad. He predicted that the display on the new iPad will sport more than double the resolution of the previous model. ""[T]here do not appear to be any significant technical hurdles remaining,"" Gardner wrote, according to Business Insider. Also look for a new camera on the iPad 3 \xe2\x80\x93 par for the course for Apple, which regularly improves the quality and megapixel-count on its iPhone cameras. Plus, Eric Zeman points out today at Information Week, it's not like the lenses on the current model iPad are winning any rewards. ""Both cameras on the iPad 2 are horrible,"" Zeman writes. ""Sure, they work for FaceTime and such, but the results are pitiful. While tablets are still unwieldy for taking pictures, most of the competition is fielding tablets with 3- and 5-megapixel cameras. I don't imagine I'll be using a tablet for most photo-taking needs, but having a decent one on board wouldn't hurt."" Meanwhile, the design of the iPad 3 could be a departure from the design of the iPad 2, which, after all, was a lot like the design of the original iPad. ""It is thought the next-generation iPad 3 will be thicker in design,"" writes the ZD Net team. ""This could suggest a larger battery that would in turn make the device compatible to cope with additional 4G LTE technology. Rumors late last month surfaced that Japan\xe2\x80\x99s largest cellular network would receive 'two new 4G LTE enabled devices,' further leading speculation that Apple has finally jumped on the next-generation wireless technology."" Lastly, don't wave goodbye to the iPad 2 just yet. Just as Apple has continued to sell its older model iPhones for a discounted price, plenty of analysts think that Apple will keep the iPad 2 on the market for a while longer, especially as cheap Android tablets continue to proliferate. (Did you see the $99 Android tablet?) ""I expect the base iPad 2 will continue to be sold, after the iPad 3 launch, for $299 all through 2012. Call it the '3GS' effect,"" writes John Martellaro of Mac Observer. ",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/15/ipad-3-rumors-what-we-know-dont-know-and-think-we-know.html
2023,Top High-Yielding Stocks: Market Pros,Halftime Report,15-12-2011,"As yields on U.S. Treasurys have dropped to the lowest levels since October, the ""Fast Money"" traders on Thursday looked for yield elsewhere. They shared their top high-yielding stock picks.To some, the utilities sector ""just doesn't seem sexy enough,"" but Veracruz founder Steve Cortes noted these stocks have outperformed the overall market for some time now and often boast healthy dividend yields. The utilities are also domestic businesses, he added, so they have no exposure to Europe's ongoing sovereign debt crisis. He likes Southern Company  in particular because its stock currently pays a 4.3 percent dividend yield. RiverTwice Capital's Zachary Karabell agreed with Cortes about going to the utilities for yield. Karabell prefers the iShares S&P Global Utilitiesexchange-traded fund , though.Stuart Frankel's Steve Grasso is also looking to the utilities for high-yielding stocks. He's a buyer of both Dominion Resources , as well as the Utilities Select Sector SPDR  ETF. Both D and XLU yield at just under 4 percent right now, he noted.When it comes to high-yielding ETFs, Karabell suggests the SPDR Barclays Capital High Yield Bond  and the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond .""You're not taking the individual name risk and if the price goes down when people get freaked, the yields will go up,"" Karabell said of JNK and HYG. ""So these are good, albeit still risky, vehicles to play the names.""Meanwhile, trader Guy Adami is finding yield outside of the utilities space. Adami likes drug manufacturer Pfizer's  stock because it boasts a 3.9 percent dividend yield. He also remains bullish on home improvement retailer Home Depot  and fast food giant McDonald's , which both happen to sport a 2.9 percent dividend yield right now.______________________________________________________Got something to to say?

2042,New Foreclosure Wave is Coming ,Real Estate,15-12-2011,"Despite a seasonal slowdown in overall foreclosure activity, and a process still bogged down and backed up by the ""robo-signing"" processing scandal, the U.S real estate market is about to be hit by another surge of bank repossessions, according to a new report from the online foreclosure sale site RealtyTrac. As banks resubmit millions of documents and courts begin hearing cases again, the backlog of over four million delinquent loans will start surging through the pipeline again. ""November\xe2\x80\x99s numbers suggest a new set of incoming foreclosure waves, many of which may roll into the market as REOs [bank repossessions] or short sales sometime early next year,\xe2\x80\x9d said James Saccacio, co-founder of RealtyTrac. \xe2\x80\x9cOverall foreclosure activity is down 14 percent from a year ago, the smallest annual decrease over the past 12 months, and some bellwether states such as California, Arizona and Massachusetts actually posted year-over-year increases in foreclosure activity in November."" Foreclosure auctions, where the property is sold at the courthouse either to an investor or in most cases back to the bank, reached a nine-month high in November, which corresponds to a recent surge in default notices, the first stage in the foreclosure process, back in August. Troubled borrowers will get a reprieve over the holidays, as mortgage giant Fannie Mae says they will not evict anyone until after the new year. A spokeswoman, however, stressed that foreclosure processing would continue through the holidays, so as not to slow the system down any more than it already is. Nevada is still in the number one spot nationally for its foreclosure rate, despite artificially low activity caused by a new state law that changes the process, requiring more documentation. It has held that dubious honor for 59 straight months. Both Georgia and Utah saw substantial monthly increases in their foreclosure rates, lifting them into the nation's top five in November. Nine out of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s 10 highest foreclosure rates among metropolitan areas with a population of 200,000 or more were in California, according to RealtyTrac, with just Las Vegas making its way into the number six spot.

""For 2012, however, our base case is that financial market conditions will move away from these extremes,"" the strategists wrote in a note to clients. And they expect the euro to move away from the commodity currencies at the same time. How do you trade this? Bennenbroek and Serebriakov argue that the euro is going to move closer to being a 'funding' currency - a currency investors sell in order to buy a higher yielding one. This would mean the euro would soften against Aussie, the kiwi, and so on. ""Should the European Central Bank continue to cut rates and otherwise ease liquidity, and considering the euro zone's relatively poor economic outlook, there may be increased willingness by market participants in 2012 to fund in euros, while investing in higher yielding commodity and emerging currencies,"" they say.

2090,Free Shipping Day: Boom or Gloom for Merchants?,Small Business,16-12-2011,"Happy Free Shipping Day.Or is it? For many online shoppers, a free shipping offer is the holy grail of deals. Forget 20 percent off an item or a coupon for a future discount: free shipping is what makes people click the \xe2\x80\x9cbuy\xe2\x80\x9d button. And today, the fourth annual Free Shipping Day, could mean banner sales for the more than 2,200 merchants that have signed on. Internet marketer Luke Knowles hatched the idea for Free Shipping Day after reading several years ago that 90 percent of consumers buy more when offered free delivery. On Free Shipping Day in 2010, Internet non-travel retail spending hit $942 million, the third-highest one-day total ever. There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that free shipping is a significant force in online retail sales.

(Even during the rest of the year, levels top 40 percent.) This \xe2\x80\x9cnegative\xe2\x80\x9d cost for the consumer can come at a notable price for the small business owner, who often tentatively skates on ultra-thin margins throughout the year in the hopes of tipping annual profit into the black come December.

2103,Allen Stanford: I Have 6 Doctors To Prove I'm Incompetent ,U.S. News,16-12-2011,"The attorney for accused Ponzi mastermind R. Allen Stanford plans to call six doctors as well as Stanford's 81-year-old mother and his first defense attorney to testify at a hearing next week on whether he is competent to stand trial.Stanford, 61, is accused of 14 criminal counts in an alleged $7 billion Ponzi scheme. He has denied wrongdoing. His attorneys have argued Stanford suffers from amnesia as a result of a 2009 prison assault and his subsequent addiction to prescription drugs. Prosecutors allege Stanford is faking memory loss to avoid his trial scheduled for next month. In court papers filed Friday, Stanford's court-appointed attorney, Ali Fazel, says he wants to call two neurologists, a neuropsychologist, a forensic psychiatrist, a medical doctor and a staff psychiatrist at the prison medical center in Butner, N.C., where Stanford recently completed nine months of treatment. Four of the doctors are experts employed by the defense. The others are government witnesses that Stanford's team wants to cross-examine.The medical center certified Stanford competent to stand trial, but it will be up to U.S. District Judge David Hittner to decide whether that is the case. The trial is scheduled to begin Jan, 23. Also on the defense witness list for the competency hearing is Stanford's 81-year-old mother Sammie, and Houston attorney Dick DeGuerin, who withdrew as Stanford's defense attorney in 2009 when it became unclear if Stanford would be able to pay him. Today's court filing offers no new clues as to what the witnesses might say, but Stanford's current legal team previously argued he is incapable of assisting in his own defense. Prosecutors plan to call two doctors to testify that Stanford is competent, and they say in a court filing today that there is no need for the amount of testimony the defense is proposing. Next week's competency hearing is crucial for the 28,000 investors in Stanford's alleged scam, because without a criminal trial and a verdict, most of their assets remain in limbo.",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/16/allen-stanford-i-have-6-doctors-to-prove-im-incompetent.html

And sure, global demand for oil has been getting softer. But Rebecca Patterson, chief markets strategist for J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Institutional, says there's a flip side. ""What drives oil supply? A lot of it is going to be geopolitics,"" she says. At the latest OPEC meeting, ""what they told us is they're comfortable with current prices.""Patterson argues that oil producers have an interest in keeping oil prices at a certain level, since they need to fund their budgets and maintain social stability. If oil drops much lower, she told CNBC's Melissa Lee, ""I think they'll intervene to support it. I don't think oil goes a lot lower.""To trade that view using currencies, Patterson recommends selling the dollar against the Canadian dollar  since Canada's economy is so closely tied to oil. Specifically, if the greenback moves to 1.0450, she wants to sell it against the Canadian dollar with a stop at 1.0525 and a target of 1.0150. Todd Gordon, co-head of research and trading at Aspen Trading Group, likes the trade from a technical standpoint. ""I think oil is a pullback buy, I think the dollar downtrend continues,"" he says.

And he thinks that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly true when it comes to ZAGG and Skullcandy.ZAGG  makes scratch protectors for devices like smartphones and Skullcandy , which went public over the summer, makes headphones that are used for portable media players and smartphones. Both are pegged as smartphone plays, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t make any smartphones. \xe2\x80\x9cZAGG and Skullcandy sell ancillary products that are ridiculously easily to duplicate \xe2\x80\xa6 so there's nothing stopping potential competitors from coming in and tearing either of them to shreds,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said.Both companies also have serious customer concentration issues. ZAGG got 41 percent of its sales from Best Buy last year and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a long-term contract with any retailer. Skullcandy gets 10 percent of its sales from Best Buy and 10 percent from Target. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, Cramer sees evidence that business is faltering. In Skullcandy\xe2\x80\x99s first quarter as a public company, it gave guidance that was lower than published estimates. In the latest quarter, its margin declined by 450 basis thanks to higher product costs.

It has more diversification, which bodes well for the company in the long-term. But it also has plans to purchase El Paso Energy.

PAA has several near-term catalysts, including a series of acquisitions totally $2.3 billion and plans to grow its distribution by 8 to 9 percent next year.But while PAA could produce slightly better gains in the next six to 12 months, Cramer thinks KMP will be the long-term winner overall.",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/19/cramer-picks-his-fave-pipeline-play.html

2137,How to Trade the Swedish Central Bank Meeting,Money in Motion,19-12-2011,"Sweden's Riksbank will meet and reach an interest rate decision Tuesday. Here's how to get ready.Yes, there are happenings in Europe outside the euro zone. Here's one: Sweden's central bank is meeting on Tuesday, and an interest rate decision will ensue. Investors seem to be divided on whether there will be a 25 basis-point rate cut, but some are starting to think there could be even more. Not so fast, says Marc Chandler, chief currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. ""We think there is scope for disappointment and suspect standing pat is likely than a 50 bp cut,"" he wrote in a note to clients. Chandler points out that while inflation is low and sentiment surveys are deteriorating, third quarter growth ran at a very respectable 4.6% and Sweden's trade surplus is holding up.Others disagree, however. At Citigroup the betting is on a 50 basis point cut, ""although there is a chance it will do just 25bp."" At Barclays Capital, analysts think a 25 basis point move is most likely - and ""as poor liquidity is also likely to weigh on the SEK next week, we think the risk reward favors being long USD/SEK,"" they wrote in a research note.\xc2\xa0 And then there is the euro zone. Chandler says the krona's direction will depend as much on events there as on anything else. After all, he says, Norway cut interest rates 50 basis points, surprising just about everyone, and the krone  has risen against both the dollar and the euro since then.

2139,"Making a List, and Taking It to the Pawnshop",U.S. News,19-12-2011,"Children in San Mateo, Calif., whispered their wish lists to Santa Claus this weekend at Best Collateral, a pawnshop in a strip mall about 20 miles south of San Francisco.And if their parents didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind discounted gifts \xe2\x80\x94 well, to be realistic, used or hocked ones \xe2\x80\x94 they did their shopping there, too. Christmas this year has come to the neighborhood pawnshop \xe2\x80\x94 and business is booming like never before. Sue Gallagher, 54, is one shopper who now works through her Christmas list at a pawnshop before heading to Wal-Mart  or Target . She recently bought a television for her daughter at Tom\xe2\x80\x99s Pawn Shop in Lake Jackson, Tex., a \xe2\x80\x9cdecent-sized flat-screen TV for less than $100.\xe2\x80\x9d She described the experience as festive, with \xe2\x80\x9cgarlands and tinsel and some music playing in the background.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like I was shopping in a pawnshop,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ms. Gallagher, who works for a nursing service. Tom\xe2\x80\x99s is not the only pawnshop that is thriving. At the Pawn America chain of stores in the Midwest, the founder Brad Rixmann said his business was up 50 percent this holiday season over last year. In San Diego, Yigal Adato, a co-owner of CashCo Pawn, said customers were showing up with Christmas lists, desperate to save money. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve had a couple of customers who say, \xe2\x80\x98You know, if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for you guys\xe2\x80\x99 prices, my kids wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be getting anything this year,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9c Mr. Adato said. While some customers have always bought Christmas gifts at pawnshops, only recently has the idea gained widespread acceptance, said Emmett Murphy, a spokesman for the National Pawnbrokers Association. So far, this holiday season has been the best one yet, he said. Many pawnshops, in turn, are embracing holiday shoppers like never before, offering promotions long deployed by more traditional stores, like \xe2\x80\x9c25 Days of Deals,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Friday\xe2\x80\x9d specials\xe2\x80\x94 even visits from Santa. It underlines how the recession has hit those at the bottom of the economic spectrum, for whom even Wal-Mart can be too expensive. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want people to think of us as an alternative to Target, Best Buy,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Rixmann said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can buy stocking stuffers for next to nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d The gloomy economy is the most immediate explanation, but industry experts also point to the success of television shows like \xe2\x80\x9cPawn Stars,\xe2\x80\x9d which have attracted a more mainstream audience to the stores.

So how can you profit off the \xe2\x80\x9ceating\xe2\x80\x9d part of that holiday equation? \xe2\x80\x9cMad Money\xe2\x80\x9d host Jim Cramer would sink his teeth into Yum! Brands, which operates KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut. Yum  is \xe2\x80\x9cone of the best restaurant stocks around, and a terrific buy, especially on a pullback that the Europeans seem increasingly prone to give us between now and the end of the year,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said Monday. It is also has one of the strongest international growth stories he's ever seen in the restaurant space. China should account for 45 percent of Yum\xe2\x80\x99s operating profit for this year. The Louisville, Ky.-based company has 4,200 locations in China and Cramer believes it could easily double that footprint. Plus, Chinese same-store sales rose 19 percent in the most recent quarter. The company is also rapidly expanding outside around the rest of the globe. Yum\xe2\x80\x99s non-China overseas division should account for 30 percent of its 2011 operating profit. Yum is forecasting a 34 percent increase in units next year and a 23 percent increase in same-store sales.The U.S. has become the least important part of Yum\xe2\x80\x99s business, but the company still expects its domestic profits to grow 5 percent next year. It has decided to refranchise many of its domestic stores, which Cramer thinks makes sense since it guarantees a stable revenue stream from royalty payments. The company is also working hard to turn the domestic business around by laying off workers at Taco Bell, restructuring KFC and adding new menu items at Pizza Hut. Plus, there has been some speculation that it may sell the Taco Bell division or the entire U.S. segment. While Cramer wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bank on that happening, he thinks it could be very positive if it does.Selling at 17.8 times next year\xe2\x80\x99s earnings, with a 12.7 percent growth rate, Cramer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think this stock is too expensive. However, he\xe2\x80\x99d like it more on a pullback since the stock is less than two points off its 52-week high. \xe2\x80\x9cBe patient and you\xe2\x80\x99ll get a chance to buy this fantastic international eating story at a discount the next time we get a European-induced market wide sell-off,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.

While he still believes that the most likely scenario is one of credit contraction in Europe and greater aggressiveness by central banks, ""The situation has deteriorated so fast that the European Central Bank is now saying their mandate is to sustain prices in both inflationary and deflationary scenarios,"" he says. ""That makes us think they might be closer to monetizing the debt than we possibly can imagine.""Adding in bond purchases by the Securities Market Programme, Williams says, ""in a market already , we could see a sharp rally coming into the new year.""It's a bold prediction - a little too bold for some. Rebecca Patterson, chief markets strategist for J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Institutional, says a rise to 1.50 ""is not just short covering. One fifty is a new trend which would imply a huge recovery, a sustained recovery in global risk appetite, major capital flows into the euro area, and probably some independent dollar weakness."" The dollar part is plausible, she says, but such a major shift in risk appetite is a stretch.Andrew Busch, global currency and public policy strategist for BMO Capital, says he thinks ""the best case for the euro is to go sideways at best, maybe 1.28 to 1.35 over the first quarter.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/19/why-the-euro-could-hit-150.html

2209,Fresh Ammo to Use on the Yen,Money in Motion,20-12-2011,"The Japanese cabinet has approved an increase in financing bill issuance. Here's what it means for the yen.Experts scoffed earlier this year when Japan intervened to stem the yen's  rise. Unilateral intervention rarely works, they said - and the yen's subsequent rise seemed to confirm that. But Japan isn't giving up. Their latest move: Japanese Cabinet approval of more financing bill issuance, which will boost their intervention firepower from about $513 billion to about $897 billion, according to Barclays Capital. ""The increased intervention 'ammunition' looks sufficient for several months, taking into account the possibility of intervention as large as 31 October,"" wrote Masafumi Yamamoto, a Barclays analyst, in a note to clients. Decent U.S. economic data has been buoying the dollar,  relieving some of the upward pressure on the yen. But just as Switzerland indicated its resolve when it intervened on the franc, Japan wants to show it means business, Yamamoto says. ""We think the purpose of this increase is more to indicate the willingness of the Japanese government to fight a stronger JPY, if needed.""Scoffers, take note. -----------------------------------MULTI CURRENCIES v The DollarTune In: CNBC's ""Money in Motion Currency Trading"" airs on Fridays at 5:30pm and repeats on Saturdays at 7pm.

2211,Europe\xe2\x80\x99s Lack of News Helps Stocks,Mad Money,20-12-2011,"U.S. stocks rallied nearly 3 percent on Tuesday as Wall Street got some help from Europe: A report showed German business optimism rising unexpectedly and as Spanish short-term financing costs fell sharply. European markets also posted solid gains at the close.Yields on three and six-month Spanish treasury bills fell sharply and demand surged in an auction on Tuesday, with analysts saying, according to Reuters, that banks were waiting to tap into an ECB three-year liquidity offer on Wednesday to pay for the higher-yielding Spanish bonds.But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t news out of Europe that caused stocks to rally, so much as it was a lack of news out of Europe. To Cramer, this was a ""Roman Holiday,"" where investors were able to recognize good things happening the U.S. and feel confident about investing. So the gains were largely thanks to data that showed housing starts and building permits both rose sharply in November. The data reinforced recent numbers showing gains in builder sentiment and increases in sale prices. This only got attention, though, because Europe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t melting down. Meanwhile, truck maker Navistar  reported strong quarterly earnings results on Tuesday, indicating that the truck market is doing well. There is a truck shortage because of the aging fleet and also due to the increased demand to drill for oil, which needs to be trucked to the railhead or pipeline or refinery. The markets finally noticed this Tuesday, but only because it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t distracted by Europe. \xe2\x80\x9cThis has to make you wonder, what happens if Europe goes on holiday until New Years? Who knows how high we could go?\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said, adding there\xe2\x80\x99s just one problem. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any sustained period of more than a few days when someone doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do something stupid over in Europe that hurts confidence and dings their economies. \xe2\x80\x9cI say ferme la bouche!

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 4 points, the S&P inched up .19 percent and the Nasdaq fell 1 percent. But even on good days, there are plenty of stocks that can cause you to lose sleep, \xe2\x80\x9cMad Money\xe2\x80\x9d host Jim Cramer said Wednesday.\xe2\x80\x9cIt still depends on the stocks,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it's not enough that we fix the challenged European banks and the troubled European countries. We also have to fix our portfolios so they avoid anything that can be hurt by Europe or slowing business worldwide.\xe2\x80\x9dTake Oracle , which reported one of the worst quarters Cramer\xe2\x80\x99s ever seen from a company that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t already pre-announced bad results. Emerson Electric  also reported weak industrial orders and CarMax  disappointed with car sales. However, there are some names Cramer thinks you won\xe2\x80\x99t lose any sleep over. First, he suggests buying a master limited partnership like Enterprise Products Partners  or Kinder Morgan Energy Partners. He also suggests taking your pick from Bristol-Myers Squibb , Merck  and Pfizer , because they all have good dividends and have decent new drug pipelines. Verizon  is a \xe2\x80\x9chuge\xe2\x80\x9d winner off the failed AT&T/T-Mobile merger and has a five percent yield, Cramer said. He likes utilities like Con Ed , Duke Energy  and Southern . He also likes the turns in Kellogg  and ConAgra Foods . General Electric , which owns 49 percent of CNBC parent company NBC Universal, is an accidentally high yielder. However, he will revisit this name when it gets to $20 because unless it keeps raising the dividend as fast as it has, the yield will be too low for Cramer to recommend aggressively. McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s  and Nike are Cramer\xe2\x80\x99s favorite growth names.

At Citigroup, Todd Elmer, an analyst there, says the bank's Economic Surprise Index has moved ""from close to a record low in June to nearly a record high at present."" Nice, huh? Just not for the dollar. When the surprise index has had earlier upside moves, the dollar has taken a hit, Elmer says. ""Stabilization in economic indicators relative to expectations boosted risk appetite and encouraged dollar selling."" And Elmer says it's just a matter of time before the pattern repeats itself.Many traders have essentially closed their books for the year, and others may be reluctant to take on big new positions right before the end of a quarter.But ""as we move into 2012 continued strength in data flow could have a more powerful impact in convincing market participants that they may have overestimated the real economic drag from the European crisis,"" Elmer says.

""What we'd expect to see is an implosion in the euro, and that's not happening,"" says Todd Gordon, co-head of research and trading at Aspen Trading Group, noting that there have been snippets of good news, like the European Central Bank's successful bank lending initiative. Still, he says, ""the downward trend is in place.""Gordon told CNBC's Scott Wapner that he thinks the euro could hit 1.2550 against the dollar in the first quarter of 2012, and drop further to around 1.20 later in the year. Not surprisingly, Gordon recommends selling the euro - just not against the dollar. ""For the next couple of weeks, if you want to go short euro, go short euro against a currency with a little bit more bang for the buck,"" he says, and that currency is the Australian dollar. Australia benefits from its strong ties to China, since the Chinese government is prepared to take all kinds of steps to support its markets. So Gordon wants to sell the euro against the Aussie  at 1.2925 with a stop at 1.3025 and a target of 1.2725. ",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/22/how-to-get-a-bigger-bang-from-selling-the-euro.html

Chadha's optimism underappreciated how an escalating European debt crisis and political gridlock in Washington would curb investor risk appetite.

2320,A Doll of An Investment,Alternative Investing,22-12-2011,"In most cases, turning a profit in the world of doll collecting requires a great deal of research and patience. But a very recent example shows that trend spotting can be an exception to the rule.In October of 2011, Mattel released tokidoki Barbie, complete with a pink bob hairdo, tattoos and cactus friend, Bastardino. The dolls retailed for $50 and are, as of this writing, listed on Amazon.comstarting at $400 and going for as much as $1,590. That kind of escalation in value is rare in a market where vintage or antique is typically the way to go. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a limited amount made,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sandi Holder, author of Barbie, A Rare Beauty and owner of the Doll Attic in Union City, Calif. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was in the news and it became controversial because mothers disapproved. More media attention drove up the demand.\xe2\x80\x9d Typically, though, the money to be made collecting Barbie dolls revolves around acquiring vintage dolls that are, optimally, still in the box with all their accessories, including the stand. Barbie was launched in 1959 and that original version, where she\xe2\x80\x99s wearing a black-and-white striped bathing suit, can fetch between $7,000 and $27,000 depending upon the condition. The latter price tag is a Guinness record set in May 2006 for \xe2\x80\x9chighest price paid for a Barbie doll in an auction\xe2\x80\x9d and is held by Holder\xe2\x80\x99s store. During her last auction, in November 2011, a doll sold for a whopping $19,000. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Barbie market and values are strong,\xe2\x80\x9d Holder said. There are two camps in the collecting world: Never Removed From Box (NRFB) and De-Boxed. For investment purposes, NRFB is ideal, but many collectors prefer to enjoy the dolls by displaying them out of the box. ",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/22/a-doll-of-an-investment.html

Just look at technology and banks, two of the biggest sectors in the S&P 500. There are good banks and bad banks, good tech and bad tech, he said. But the sectors are regarded as being unified. Take technology.\xe2\x80\x9cThe problem right now is that, at this particular moment, the growth rates of many tech companies and sector subsets are slowing,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. \xe2\x80\x9cMany are falling further behind other industries \xe2\x80\xa6 to the point where the sector's growth is only slightly better than the world's growth.\xe2\x80\x9dThere are only select portions of tech that can really run, which is why he focuses on individual companies that can grow faster than the group itself. Right now, he thinks only Apple and Google  are consistent winners. The bank business is similar. Cramer likes some regionals and thinks U.S. Bancorp  is the best. But he also likes companies that are growing faster than the global economy and right now, there are almost no banks doing that. \xe2\x80\x9cThe regulators want them to put up more capital, the Fed is making it so they can't make much money just by turning on the lights everyday and playing the yield curve,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Plus fees are coming down, competition is tough and lending standards have gotten extremely high. Finally, both tech and banks don\xe2\x80\x99t have what this market wants most\xe2\x80\x94dividends. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are so many other places to go, and so few stocks that buck the headwinds of banking and tech that I gotta ask, why bother?\xc2\xa0 If the global economy grows, I would rather own the industrials,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it slows I'd rather own the food and drug stocks and pocket the dividends.

Just a few days ago, investors had thought a sharp move higher wasoff the table \xe2\x80\x93 but optimism has quickly returned to the Street.Part of the bullish sentiment stems from the latest economic data; new jobless claims hit a 3-1/2 year low last week and consumer sentiment improved in December to its highest level in six months.Although he\xe2\x80\x99s been bearish, trader Guy Adami is among those traders looking for a whoosh higher. \xe2\x80\x9cPrice is truth,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.

""As we get back to January, we're going to see a return to the risk off type of environment"" as Europe's problems comes back into focus. For now, though, Davis likes a trade that's supported both by risk appetite and by fundamentals: buying the Canadian dollar against the Swiss franc.

2367,"When Investing, Timing Is Everything",Mad Money,23-12-2011,"One of the most important and often frustrating parts of managing your money in the stock market is figuring out exactly when to buy and sell stocks, Cramer said. So to help his \xe2\x80\x9chomegamer\xe2\x80\x9d viewers become better investors, the \xe2\x80\x9cMad Money\xe2\x80\x9d host shared some lessons he\xe2\x80\x99s learned in his more than 30 years of trading.To start, Cramer said investors should almost never sell when the market is taking a beating and everyone is panicking. Inversely, this is often the right time to buy. After all, if the indices are sinking, investors can get stocks at a discount to where they were recently trading. Whether it was the sell-off following the Japanese nuclear crisis in February 2011 or the \xe2\x80\x98flash crash\xe2\x80\x99 of May 2010, the aftermath of 9/11 or the stock market crash of 1987, none of these events had been the right time to sell. Instead, Cramer found prudent buying had later proved profitable during these times of maximum fear.\xe2\x80\x9cThe only time, actually, that panic made sense, was to sell into the morass that was 2008 because the financial system was on the brink of the collapse,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said, adding it was a systemic crisis rather than a temporary one, so panicking made sense then. \xe2\x80\x9cBuying actually hurt you because stocks just kept falling and falling, so you never got a chance to unload the merchandise you bought on the dip at a higher price.\xe2\x80\x9dInvestors who took Cramer\xe2\x80\x99s lead and sold in September 2008 avoided an almost 45 percent decline, he noted. But again, this is the only time that Cramer thought selling into panic was a good idea.Most of the time, it\xe2\x80\x99s a smart move to buy when people are panicking. In volatile or turbulent markets when things don\xe2\x80\x99t look pretty, Cramer recommends being patient. Investors have to keep their head because there will likely be a better momentum to sell. The right move is almost always to buy into weakness, so he suggests keeping that mind the next time there\xe2\x80\x99s a pullback.Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

In his more than 30 years of investing, the only time Cramer recommended giving in to the panic was during the height of the financial crisis in September 2008. The entire financial crisis on the brink of collapse, he said, so selling made sense at that time and investors who heeded his call avoided a near 45 percent decline. But that was the only time\xe2\x80\x94a systemic crisis, not a temporary one. It\xe2\x80\x99s usually a good idea to buy into weakness because you can get stocks at a discount to where they were recently trading.But every investor is different and some may want to sell in an incredibly bearish moment. When this happens, Cramer said investors have to resist the urge to sell everything. His rule of thumb is that investors buy or sell in increments. That way, if a stock goes down you can buy more at a lower price. If it goes higher after you\xe2\x80\x99ve sold some, you can sell more at a higher price.Bottom line: Not every decline is the end of the world, but if you are worried and need to sell, just don\xe2\x80\x99t sell everything at once.Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

2384,Cramer: These Retailers are Value Traps,Mad Money,22-12-2011,"HHGregg, Best Buy and RadioShack have all fallen dramatically this year, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean these stocks are a bargain, \xe2\x80\x9cMad Money\xe2\x80\x9d host Jim Cramer said Thursday. In fact, he thinks they are all broken companies.\xe2\x80\x9cThese three electronics merchants have fairly different profiles, but they all have their own problems,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said, \xe2\x80\x9cand worse, they're all part of an industry that's in long-term secular decline \xe2\x80\xa6 courtesy of low-priced competition from Internet based retailers like Amazon that are pantsing the bricks and mortar guys.\xe2\x80\x9dWhile there are bull cases for each name, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think any of them hold water. For instance, HHGregg  plans to add 20 to 25 new locations next year and its last quarter came in better than expected. However, he said if the fundamentals of the industry are declining, new stores won\xe2\x80\x99t help. And the results from last quarter weren\xe2\x80\x99t all rosy\xe2\x80\x94their margins were worst than expected and its same-store sales growth was \xe2\x80\x9canemic.\xe2\x80\x9dThe bulls have pointed to Best Buy\xe2\x80\x99s  cash flows, but Cramer said the company has been \xe2\x80\x9csquandering\xe2\x80\x9d most of its cash on buy backs that haven\xe2\x80\x99t worked and its quarters keep disappointing. There is also a lot that can go wrong. Best Buy normally trades off of same-store sales numbers and margins, and Cramer thinks Best Buy just can\xe2\x80\x99t compete with online retailers.RadioShack  has been trying to restructure its business with more of a focus on mobile devices and doubled its dividend. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s not known if the restructuring will work, Cramer said. In the meantime, there are several problems with the company. It faces \xe2\x80\x9cvicious\xe2\x80\x9d competition and every key metric last quarter came in under expectations. And while the company is trying to turn itself around with smartphones, its other products are being crushed. When you analyze the valuations, none of these stocks are cheap, Cramer said.\xe2\x80\x9cBest Buy, Radio Shack and HHGregg have all been slammed this year, but they deserved to be slammed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said \xe2\x80\x9cThey are value traps, destined to look cheap forever, luring you toward them, only to have you be disappointed time and time again.\xe2\x80\x9d ",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/22/cramer-these-retailers-are-value-traps.html

2391,How to Play IPOs,Mad Money,23-12-2011,"Analyzing a company\xe2\x80\x99s initial public offering is not easy, since it depends on the price of the offering and the amount of shares being offered, \xe2\x80\x9cMad Money\xe2\x80\x9d host Jim Cramer said. The bankers don\xe2\x80\x99t always offer all the outstanding shares, and the price may just be the \xe2\x80\x9cprice talk\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94meaning it is the initial price and not the last price. Another important variable is what Cramer calls the \xe2\x80\x9csliver\xe2\x80\x9d offering\xe2\x80\x94where bankers offer just a fraction of the outstanding shares in order to generate excitement and cause the stock to pop. Those are the deals Cramer likes. \xe2\x80\x9cAny deal where a new company offers less than ten percent of the company on the IPO is one I want you in on, even if I don't like the company,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.However, he has very specific rules of engagement\xe2\x80\x94get in on the stock offering and then \xe2\x80\x9cring the register\xe2\x80\x9d when it opens. Take Groupon , for example. There are 640 million shares of GRPN but the bankers only offered 40 million shares for its IPO last month. Cramer said that offering almost assured that demand would exceed supply. Groupon was priced at $20, it opened at $28 and then traded to $30. After that it began a \xe2\x80\x9clong, ugly slog down.\xe2\x80\x9d It ultimately traded at $15 but has now bounced back above the offering price.\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes there's only two decisions to be made here, put in for a sliver deal and then to sell it into the pop,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou time that sell to the very open of the hot deal.

2393,How to Time Your Sells,Mad Money,23-12-2011,"There are many stocks where, when you buy them, you need to understand that someday you will have to sell, \xe2\x80\x9cMad Money\xe2\x80\x9d host Jim Cramer said. High-flying tech stocks, for example, can\xe2\x80\x98t be owned forever. The same goes for the smokestack industrial companies\xe2\x80\x94the so-called cyclicals, which are hostage to the business cycle. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of this comes down to simply understanding what you own and being willing to change your mind,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. Tech stocks like Skyworks Solutions  or Micron Technology , are trading vehicles, as opposed to staples like Pepsico and Altria , which \xe2\x80\x9cplod along slowly.\xe2\x80\x9d These trading vehicles are winners when a product cycle is strong, but are losers when the cycle is weak. Often the high-flying tech stocks will get hammered after the first sign that anything is deteriorating. When that happens, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell yourself it\xe2\x80\x99s too late to sell. Use any intra-day weakness to lighten up, Cramer said. Discipline also makes a huge difference, he said. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be \xe2\x80\x9cgreedy\xe2\x80\x9d when owning these stocks\xe2\x80\x94take something off the table and play with the house\xe2\x80\x99s money. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t treat risky trading vehicles like shooting star tech stocks as though they\xe2\x80\x99re staples that can be owned for ages,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember to take profits on the way up, and to get out on the way down\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to call the top to make money in these names, you just have to be willing to jump ship when it\xe2\x80\x99s clear the stock has peaked and is ready to head down for the count.\xe2\x80\x9dCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

2394,How to Trade Holiday Cheer Using Currencies,Money in Motion,23-12-2011,"With equities in a holiday mood, here's how to trade the high spirits using currencies.Stocks sure have had a nice run lately, and risk-on currencies have been following suit. Andrew Busch, global currency and public policy strategist for BMO Capital, thinks the good times could extend a bit, and he's got a plan to trade the mood.""If you think the rally is going to extend into next week, and obviously maybe in the first week of the new year, you want risk on,"" he told CNBC's Melissa Lee. Commodity currencies continue to be a good bet in that scenario, and Busch would buy the Canadian dollar against the yen. The pair has rallied 2.5% over the last few days, he says, suggesting ""good positive correlation with an equity rally.""A more bearish outlook would indicate selling a riskier currency, like the South African rand, against the yen, Busch says.  He notes that ""the yen  appreciated 4% in a very risk-off year, and the rand  lost 18.5%. It's the worst performer of the major currencies.""Busch himself is in a holiday mood, so he wants to buy the loonie against the yen. He recommends entering the trade at 76.60 with a stop at 75.50, and taking half your profits at 77.40. And if you hit that target, he says, make sure to move your stop up to lock in your gains. Todd Gordon, co-head of research and trading at Aspen Trading Group, likes the trade - but he suggests waiting for a pullback. If stocks get to 1,260, he says, he'd be more comfortable entering at that point. ",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/23/how-to-trade-holiday-cheer-using-currencies.html

Investors paid $0.25 and $0.30, and volume was quadruple the open interest in the strike. Manulife  fell 0.38 percent to $10.40 on Friday and has lost more than one-third of its value in the last six months. The declines have been slowing since the summer, however, and valuations could attract some investors: It trades at less than book value and has a 5 percent dividend yield. Those long callslock in an entry price on the stock, so they could double or triple if Manulife rallies to $12 by in the next few months. But they will also expire worthless if the stock fails to move. Given the apparent cheapness of the stock, and how long they have for the calls to pay off, Friday's trades seem to be an inexpensive bet that Manulife will rebound in coming months.

2414,"Buy Broken Stocks, Not Broken Companies",Mad Money,27-12-2011,"Buy broken stocks, not broken companies. It\xe2\x80\x99s a longtime Cramer maxim, and a sell-off can be the best opportunity. But how does an investor tell the difference?Usually, broken companies lead the decline. They\xe2\x80\x99re the reason the sell-off is happening in the first place. In 2007, weak real estate, bad loans and mortgages and the bonds that backed them all lead to the credit crisis. So any company related to housing, lending and mortgages was probably broken.More recently, a combination of concerns caused stocks to fall in summer 2011, including the U.S. debt ceiling, S&P's credit rating downgrade and liquidity concerns in Europe. All of these things led to a steep sell-off and increased volatility.Aside of the companies that were at the center of the fray, there\xe2\x80\x99s another group whose profitability is affected even though these companies aren\xe2\x80\x99t directly related to the cause of the sell-off. Cramer offered retail during 2007 as an example because the credit crunch had killed the spending power of the consumer. In 2011, the financials are a good example because these companies remain in the ""cross-hairs of government regulation"" following the Great Recession. Slower gross domestic product growth means slower growth for the sector, he explained.But a company isn\xe2\x80\x99t broken just because the stock price dropped. It\xe2\x80\x99s only when the reason for liking it is gone that a company attains that status. Just look at the other sectors in 2007 that dropped when housing and credit took the market down. Infrastructure, oil and agriculture were all strong industries that took at hit even though they weren\xe2\x80\x99t factors in the decline.

2426,The Biggest Market Myth There Is?,Mad Money,27-12-2011,"Any new investor who hopes to successfully buy and sell stocks should know that the market is not rational, Cramer said Tuesday. And desperate attempts to make sense out of the nonsensical can cost you.Sometimes stocks or the whole market will go up or down for reasons that have nothing to do with the underlying prospects of actual companies. Sure, you\xe2\x80\x99ll search for a legitimate answer and the media will offer a few as well. But there will come a point where you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to admit, Cramer said, that the moves are \xe2\x80\x9cjust nuts.\xe2\x80\x9dHere\xe2\x80\x99s one way to put things in perspective, though: If the market\xe2\x80\x99s wild fluctuations can\xe2\x80\x99t be explained by business fundamentals, then they are most likely the effect of money-management fundamentals.A lot of times money managers, namely hedge funds , will be caught on the wrong side of their trades. They start selling to raise cash because their clients want their money back. Then their selling scares other investors into dumping their own positions, and stocks are brought down across the board. Next thing you know some pundit is on TV trying to explain why gold , historically a protection against volatility, is down on a day when the markets plummeted, too.It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t always like this. Back when Cramer first started trading in the 1980s, stocks were valued according to the underlying company. The share price depended on things like earnings, cash on the balance sheet, revenues and profit margins. But during that decade, stocks began to be lumped into giant baskets that mimicked, say, the S&P 500 . As a result, stocks became an asset class that at times traded together in lockstep, regardless of their positive or negative prospects.This practice spread from country to country, Cramer said, and it turned stocks into commodities that were traded by contract with futures or exchange-traded funds. But then hedge-fund managers got involved and changed the whole game.Hedge funds were able to pool such vast amounts of money that they dwarfed individual stocks. They had so much cash that they could buy all the shares available of many companies trading on the market. And because futures markets are much bigger than the regular markets, these funds gravitated toward the former. In the process, they formed a groupthink mentality and started to trade in synch with each other based on the same indicators. The height of this groupthink occurred in 2008, Cramer said, when a lot of hedge funds bought and sold the same commodities, and did so with borrowed money. When those trades turned out to be wrong, the funds were forced to sell en masse in order to keep from going under. The end result was that the related stocks took a serious hit, and unnecessarily so. The positive side of this action, though, is that these moves are opportunities. While some stocks deserve to go down, others do not. This kind of activity continues to happen today, including during summer 2011. So don\xe2\x80\x99t buy into the panic, Cramer said, buy the declines. And they will happen again because hedge funds are still trading stocks in the same way.\xe2\x80\x9cThe next time you see everything go down at once,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said, \xe2\x80\x9cask yourself if we might simply be seeing the results of hedge funds gone wild.\xe2\x80\x9dWritten by Tom Brennan; Edited by Drew SandholmCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

2428,Don\xe2\x80\x99t Trust Buybacks,Mad Money,27-12-2011,"Cramer used to be a big fan of companies who repurchased their shares on the open market. He thought they were a good way to reward shareholders because the buybacks boosted the stock price. But a lot of these deals haven\xe2\x80\x99t returned the value he thought they would, and in some cases they\xe2\x80\x99ve been \xe2\x80\x9ca gigantic waste of corporate money,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.Since the crash of 2008 there have been a number of companies that bought back their stock at higher prices, leaving shareholders with nothing to show for the billions spent doing it. The health-maintenance organizations might be the worst offenders. Instead of paying dividends, Aetna , WellPoint  and Unitedhealth Group  used that money to finance massive buybacks \xe2\x80\x94 even though in some cases insiders were selling at the same time.In the end, the buybacks did nothing for the stocks. And what\xe2\x80\x99s worse, they left on the table what would have been yielding more than 4 percent if these companies had poured the money into dividends. That\xe2\x80\x99s the level at which all dividend-paying companies become more attractive to investors, Cramer said, and a flurry of buying might have provided the share-price support they had originally wanted.So why do CEOs like buybacks so much? Remember, a company\xe2\x80\x99s earnings-per-share is its net income divided by the total number of shares. So the repurchase of stock is a cheap way to boost the EPS.Also, CEOs often try to call a bottom in their company\xe2\x80\x99s stock by announcing a buyback. But this shows a lack of understanding of how the market works, because the share price will continue to plummet as long as the business is in decline.Cramer dispelled the myth that buybacks can cushion a stock\xe2\x80\x99s fall in a bear market. Unfortunately, short sellers these days wield too much power, enough to overwhelm even the most well-intentioned company. Especially because there are rules about how much stock a company can buy back on a given day. Meanwhile, the regulations that used to keep short sellers in check disappeared while Christopher Cox was running the Securities and Exchange Commission. In sum, you never want to own the stock of a company that\xe2\x80\x99s wasting the money it needs to survive on useless buybacks. Or worse, spending money it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have on them. And never rely on even the largest repurchase plan to help prop up a stock. \xe2\x80\x9cThe way I see it,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom now on, buybacks [are a] false sign of health and too often a waste of shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 money.\xe2\x80\x9dWritten by Tom Brennan; Edited by Drew SandholmCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

It's true; when you have volatility we have had this year, when the Dow can move 300 points in a day and no one even blinks, you will have investors shoot first and ask questions later, as we have seen with Sears today. But don't think that everything is the same, that stocks only move in tandem up or down. True, correlations are unusually high, but even in a space like retail there are plenty of winners and losers.

2430,Buying the Right Sell-Off Stocks,Mad Money,27-12-2011,"There are two specific kinds of stocks Cramer looks for during a sell-off: those knocked from their highs and those that pay dividends. The more brutal the sell-off, he said, the more attractive these stocks tend to look.The new-high list is always a great place to look for investments. After all, stocks usually don\xe2\x80\x99t make it there for no reason, Cramer said. But a stock that\xe2\x80\x99s hit a new high can be expensive, turning off interested traders. A correction takes care of that dilemma, though. If a market dip is the only reason the share price has dropped, chances are the stock is solid. So those are exactly the kinds of companies Cramer suggests you look for because they tend to rebound the fastest when the market turns up. The caveat here is that not all stocks pushed off the new-high list are worth buying. In fact, often times they\xe2\x80\x99re the companies leading the sell-off. Investors have to do their homework to figure out which stocks are worth owning and which aren't.Cramer also searches for dividend-paying stocks during a correction. When the market declines, and with it the share prices of these stocks, yields go up. (Remember: A $1 dividend on a $20 stock has a 5 percent yield. The yield on a $10 stock with a $1 dividend is 10 percent.) And while dividends aren\xe2\x80\x99t sexy, he admitted, they put money in your pocket during the hard times of a sell-off. This, of course, is based on the notion that a company has no intention of cutting its dividend. That\xe2\x80\x99s why you never buy a damaged company just because the yield has skyrocketed. Damaged companies might cut their dividends. Companies with damaged stocks probably won\xe2\x80\x99t. Cramer\xe2\x80\x99s rule of thumb: If the company\xe2\x80\x99s expected earnings are twice the size of the dividend payment, then the dividend should be reasonably safe. A sell-off is an opportunity to buy, Cramer said, especially stocks that have just pulled off their highs, and stocks with dividends that have grown larger thanks to the decline.Written by Tom Brennan; Edited by Drew SandholmCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

Born of the impossibly varied options we have to amuse ourselves, cutting-edge companies are finding innovative ways to tailor our entertainment choices to who we are, relieving us of the burden of finding the diamond in the rough of 500 TV channels or thousands of movies and music albums released every year. Despite its recent missteps, Netflix is the paragon of this new breed of company. Once you\xe2\x80\x99ve signed on, one of the first steps you go through is to rate a bunch of movies you\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen. Based on your past preferences, Netflix proceeds to tell you what your future preferences may, in fact, be. Services such as Pandora and Spotify offer a very similar process to help people discover new music that suits their tastes. Google and Facebook, each in their own way, have revolutionized the delivery of advertising based on search and social networking, creating a sort of anti-Spam: targeted, relevant ads that a consumer might actually welcome rather than spurn.

To play this long-term trend, Cramer suggests ""best of breed"" tractor maker Deere . He also likes fertilizer maker Potash .""These companies make a killing when farmers around the world are spending,"" Cramer said.

2463,Cramer: What It Takes to Pick Winning Stocks,Mad Money,28-12-2011,"Investors are capable of picking winning stocks, Cramer said Wednesday, but it's going to take work. To start, the ""Mad Money"" host said homegamers need a little conviction.It's important investors find stocks that inspire a high level of confidence, Cramer said. With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, he doesn't recommend investing in one you don't believe in. Home gamers need to believe in the underlying company because the market will often test an investor's conviction, Cramer said. The investor should like the story enough to buy more shares if it gets knocked down. Moreover, investors should welcome declines because they provide buying opportunities. A pullback, Cramer said, is the market's way of throwing a sale.Finding stocks worthy of this kind of trust can be challenging, Cramer admitted. He recommends long-term themes, like the global food shortage or power management. As millions of people in the developing world migrate from rural to urban areas, they start buying electricity. What's more important than where we get our power, Cramer said, is how we use it. That's where power management comes in. After all, businesses will continue to have a strong desire to lower their electric bills and corporations will always need to protect the bottom line. In doing so, these businesses are going to do anything to save money and Cramer said energy conservation is a great way to do it.To play the power management theme, Cramer likes the power control names and energy efficiency heating, ventilation and air conditioning makers. As regulators around the world continue to push for minimum energy efficiency standards and companies seeks to reduce their electric bills, they are installing more efficient HVAC systems, as made by Ingersoll-Rand , Johnson Controls  and Watsco . Cramer also likes Honeywell , which makes automation and control systems that are energy efficient. Its process controls, building energy management and security systems and smart grid demand response technologies help reduce energy consumption at peak hours.Emerson Electric is another play on power management, Cramer said. The company produces power management and industrial automation gear. Emerson also has a terrific HVAC business, where it's the market leader in energy efficient scroll compressor technology\xe2\x80\x94the heart of both residential and commercial HVAC systems, Cramer said. It is also the main player in power management for data centers, which Cramer said are big ""energy hogs.""Eaton  has started competing with Emerson in providing power management for data centers. It makes electrical control products, fuel efficient transmissions and hybrid engines for trucks, as well as fluid power systems and aerospace hydraulic systems that enable large aircraft to burn less fuel.Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCWhen this story was published, Cramer's charitable trust owned Johnson Controls.Questions for Cramer?

2465,Cramer Identifies a Theme for Up or Down Days,Mad Money,28-12-2011,"Cramer is always looking for investment ideas that do well when the market goes higher, but also give home gamers something to fall back on when the averages fall.Take homeland security, for example. Although Cramer wishes it wasn't so, this is a long-term theme. The U.S. Congress may seek to trim the U.S. Defense budget, but lawmakers won't cut in areas pertaining to protection and prevention. Cramer said the trend won't go away, so long as the U.S. continues to fight terrorism. Meanwhile, countries around the world spend $140 billion fighting terror. The number should double over the next decade, according to the British Trade and Information Office. All said and done, Cramer figures investors might as well try and make some money off of this enormous defense theme.There are many ways to play security, but Cramer said many of them are speculative. For that reason, he recommends investors take caution when selecting stocks. Before buying any counter-terrorism plays, Cramer suggests doing your homework and waiting for a pullback.As more and more sensitive information gets stored online, the market for cyber security grows. In this space, Cramer recommends Verint . It makes software used by security companies, law enforcement and intelligence agencies to analyst video and communications data. But like the aforementioned name, Cramer wouldn't pay up for this one. Instead, wait for a pullback.To capture both the physical and network side of security, Cramer recommends NICE Systems . This Israeli company makes analytics software for video surveillance, as well as communication inception and other spy-like products.""The need to secure our people against terrorists and our data against all kinds of online predators is not going away anytime soon and that makes counter-terrorism and network security two big businesses,"" Cramer said. ""It's a long-term theme to fall back on and circle the wagons around when the market gets hammered, but don't try to chase these security stocks when the averages are roaring. You will only get hurt.""Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

2472,Downtrend in Hang Seng to Continue: Charts,Charting Asia,27-12-2011,"Hong Kong\xe2\x80\x99s Hang Seng Index retains its volatility, but remains in a strong downtrend. This provides short term long side trades, and longer term short side trades. A retest of the 2008 lows cannot be excluded.The first observation about the Hang Seng is obvious, but still ignored by many. The Hang Seng is not a substitute for trading the Shanghai Index. The behavior is very different. Starting at the end of the first quarter in 2011 the Hang Seng developed a strong and persistent downtrend.The downtrend line is the dominant feature on the chart. This line is the ultimate cap on every rally in 2011 and it will be the most important rally cap in 2012. This is a well-established resistance level. A breakout above this line will signal a major change in the trend and will be the most important long-side trading signal.The fall is defined by the trend line, but the limits of the fall are defined by the support and resistance levels. The most significant current support level is near 17,200.A sustained fall below this level has support near 15,800, which is the level of the small consolidation band following the depths of the 2008 collapse. This is as market well on the way to retesting the 2008 lows.Traders can enjoy the rallies, but they must keep a close eye on the resistance levels, and the value of the downtrend line. These are reaction points and the points for taking profits from long side trades.On balance we are bearish on the Hang Seng but we also look for evidence of consolidation and a powerful move above the downtrend line to signal its time to take long side positions.Daryl Guppy is a trader and author of Trend Trading, The 36 Strategies of the Chinese for Financial Traders \xe2\x80\x93www.guppytraders.com .

The case of Thomas Dougherty represents one particularly costly example. He spent five months this year without a left hip, largely stuck on a recliner watching his medical bills soar. In August, Mr. Dougherty underwent an operation to replace a failed artificial hip, but his pelvis fractured soon afterward. The replacement hip was abandoned and then a serious infection set in. Some of the bills: $400,776 in charges related to hospitalizations, and $28,081 in doctors\xe2\x80\x99 bills. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sitting here on a La-Z-Boy meant for someone who is 80 and I\xe2\x80\x99m 55,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Dougherty, who lives in Groveland, Ill., and works at Caterpillar, the heavy equipment manufacturer. His bills are \xe2\x80\x9cfive times as much\xe2\x80\x9d as he paid for his home. The so-called metal-on-metal hips like Mr. Dougherty\xe2\x80\x99s, ones in which a device\xe2\x80\x99s ball and joint are made of metal, are failing at high rates within a few years instead of lasting 15 years or more, as artificial joints normally do. The wear of metal parts against each other is generating debris that is damaging tissue and, in some cases, crippling patients. The incidents have set off a financial scramble. Recently, lawsuits and complaints against makers of all-metal replacement hips passed the 5,000 mark. Insurers are alerting patients that they plan to recover their expenses from any settlement money that patients receive. Medicare is also expected to try to recover its costs. While his insurer has covered his bills so far, Mr. Dougherty said he was preparing to sue his surgeon, who may have implanted the device incorrectly, and Johnson & Johnson , which produced his artificial hip, to help recoup some of the insurer\xe2\x80\x99s money. \xe2\x80\x9cAll these payers want to be paid back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matt Garretson, the founding partner of the Garretson Resolution Group, a firm in Cincinnati that manages product liability cases. Until a recent sharp decline, all-metal implants accounted for nearly one-third of the estimated 250,000 hip replacements performed each year in the United States. Some 500,000 patients have received an all-metal replacement hip, according to one estimate. A new study found that no new artificial hip or knee introduced during a recent five-year period \xe2\x80\x94 implants that included some of the all-metal hips \xe2\x80\x94 were more durable than older devices, and 30 percent were worse. One troubled all-metal model, implanted in 40,000 patients in the United States, was recalled last year by the DePuy division of Johnson & Johnson. As of October, some 3,500 patients had filed a lawsuit involving that device. There is no data on the number of all-metal hips that have failed prematurely in this country because the outcomes of orthopedic procedures are not formally tracked by the government or private companies. But extrapolating from overseas data and the estimate of metal hip use here, tens of thousands of patients in the United States may have to undergo operations over the next decade to replace the implants, said Dr. Art Sedrakyan, a researcher at Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University, who is studying the hip problem. A decade ago, Sulzer Orthopedics paid a record $1 billion to settle claims by 6,800 patients who received artificial hips and knees that were contaminated with industrial oil during the manufacturing process. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have been dwarfed by this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Teresa Ford, a lawyer who worked at Sulzer at the time and is now in private practice.

2478,GNC is IPO Star Of 2011,Sports Biz with Darren Rovell,28-12-2011,"When GNC hit the market in April, it had its fair share of critics. Apollo, its former owner, unsuccessfully tried to take it public twice. Even more recently, the company failed to complete a prospective merger deal with Chinese buyer Bright Food. The company had $1 billion in debt and it was competing in the tremendously competitive vitamin and supplement space, which seemingly had shrinking margins.But GNC has emerged as the top IPOin a year where six percent less money was raised than 2010. Of the 125 deals priced in the US in 2011, GNC is the top performer through the close on December 27, gaining almost 83% from its IPO filing price of $16 on April 1.GNC narrowly edged data security company Imperva , who was up 82 percent on the year.

2480,Small Business Trends to Watch in 2012,Small Business,28-12-2011,"To say we are in a time of unprecedented change in business would be a vast understatement. Whether it's the transformation wrought by our flat world or technology or social media or the seeming decline of the American economy or the Euro crisis or, oh, about 14 other things, this is both an exciting and nerve-wracking time to be in business.Quick personal example: I first wrote ""The Small Business Bible"" in 2003. At that time I spent a lot of time discussing the need for small businesses to have a website. Quaint, eh? In 2007, when I wrote the second edition, the mobile business revolution \xe2\x80\x94 people working out of the office, on laptops, etc. \xe2\x80\x94 was the hot topic. This year, as I finish the third edition, I have 10 new chapters because I see that the only social media mention I made in the last edition was about (gulp) MySpace. So yes, things change rapidly today. And while trends are intriguing to learn about for their own sake, let me suggest that they should actually be an important component of your strategic thinking and planning. Today's trends become tomorrow's realities. In this first of two reports, here are the trends, factors, and events that will affect your business in the coming 12 months: ",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/28/small-business-trends-to-watch-in-2012.html

Election year campaign promises will reduce the odds that anything will get done to address the growth in entitlement spending. The rating agencies will respond in kind, but the reaction will be muted as the US remains the only safe haven. Treasury yields  will remain very low. 3) will continue to be the beneficiary of turmoil in Europe and slowing growth in China and other developing countries. US Treasurieswill remain well bid, but the major beneficiary will be high-quality, large cap blue chip US multinationals with strong balance sheets and above-average dividend yields. In a continuation of a trend established over the past few months, blue chips will outperform handily. The ""risk-on"" trade will be off. 4) Unless there is a disruption in the Middle East, the will drop below $80 as Europe falls into recession, growth rates in China slow, and the dollar continues to strengthen. 5) The European Union will be held together by a thread as officials continue putting fingers in the dike. There will be an agreement on closer fiscal oversight by a centralized European authority. However, the bazooka of Eurobonds and/or massive ECB buying of sovereign debt will remain elusive. Private holders of Greek bonds will agree to a haircut of greater than 50%. A European Bank will fail. ",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/28/farr-10-predictions-for-2012.html

To play it, he recommends companies that can deliver high-quality food that's both delicious and healthy, like Whole Foods , Hain Celestial , Panera Bread  and Chipotle .

That\xe2\x80\x99s why Cramer addressed the topic on Friday's ""Mad Money.""The thing is, there are a lot of details that investors need to know about IPOs before they buy them. Sure, there are the basics: Not everyone one is worth consideration, and these deals aren\xe2\x80\x99t about luck. But did you also know that underwriters often underprice an offering just to attract interest?It\xe2\x80\x99s true. There are times when retail investors are sitting on the sidelines, and the underwriters try to draw them in. Why? Not only to help the soon-to-be-public company raise money, but also to keep their other clients, those who trade stocks, interested in the market. Because when the clients are buying and selling, the underwriters, who offer brokerage services as well, are making money on those transactions, too. So a well-priced IPO serves to get them back in the game.One thing investors should never do, though, Cramer said, is buy in the aftermarket, which is buying an IPO\xe2\x80\x99d stock once it\xe2\x80\x99s available to the public. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t get in the deal, forget about it. Otherwise you\xe2\x80\x99ll just end up overpaying.Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

2520,Investing After the Crash,Mad Money,29-12-2011,"The line between trading and investing may have blurred, Cramer said Thursday, especially after the crash of 2008.He used to define investing as a long-term buying strategy, one where a stock was bought with an 18-month time horizon in mind. Trading, on the other hand, was a near-term approach used to capitalize on market fluctuations. But now Cramer is recommending some combination of both, because those short-term price moves could be the best way to recoup your losses from the crash and get back to even.\xe2\x80\x9cI think we all need some trader in our DNA,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said.Of course, plenty of financial advisers would rail against this. They still believe in \xe2\x80\x9cbuy and hold,\xe2\x80\x9d the idea that the gains earned over the long term will compensate for any short-term losses. But after the credit crisis and the Dow\xe2\x80\x99s near 5,000-point plunge that followed, Cramer decided the short-term fluctuations just can\xe2\x80\x99t be ignored.Price matters. A certain stock may look attractive at $30 but not at $55. Another name could be buyable at $600 but not at $700. That\xe2\x80\x99s because the risk profile changes as the price does. Certain stocks deserve to be sold when they soar too high, while others should be bought when they dip too low. And if you got one of those stocks at a lower price, then certainly you\xe2\x80\x99d want to lock in the gains and buy them back on a decline.Cramer likened it to shopping at, say, Macy\xe2\x80\x99s . You see a sweater you like for just $30, so you buy it. But you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t consider the purchase at all if the sweater was going for $55. Well, the market is like \xe2\x80\x9cMacy\xe2\x80\x99s on steroids,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Stocks are marked up and put on sale with alarming frequency, and investors watch these moves in order to get the desired merchandise at the best price possible.Now, Cramer wasn\xe2\x80\x99t trying to turn his viewers into day traders. But he firmly believes that any loss that can be avoided should be avoided, and you should buy good stocks when they go on sale. If fact, it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt to have a shopping list of companies you\xe2\x80\x99ll snatch up when the price is right. And the same goes for selling. When a stock on the list has moved high enough, then take profits.Cramer called this \xe2\x80\x9cthe basis of intelligent long-term investing.\xe2\x80\x9dCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

A few positive readings in home sales and housing starts recently, topped off by today's 7.4 percent monthly jump in contracts to buy existing homes, are fueling what I dare say is a spark, albeit not a fire. They are also managing to trump what was a particularly opposing readingin home prices from the number crunchers at S&P/Case-Shiller this week.

2522,Beating the Pros,Mad Money,29-12-2011,"After years of doing homework for school, no one wants to do it for stocks. But as Cramer pointed out on Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s ""Mad Money,"" the extra time spent researching a company can give you an edge on other investors.A lot of people might say that any number of factors can separate a stock from its underlying company\xe2\x80\x94cash-rich hedge funds, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94and therefore there\xe2\x80\x99s little point in emphasizing the fundamentals. Then there are those who say that all the information on a company is public, so it\xe2\x80\x99s already priced into the stock. What these theories are missing, though, is the ability of homework to cut through the ups and downs of a very capricious market.Study your stocks well, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll know the range in which a company is supposed to trade. That\xe2\x80\x99s important because, short-term fluctuations or not, stocks tend to drift back to their true value, which is based on how the underlying companies are performing. Also, homework will tell you when to cut your losses if a stock isn\xe2\x80\x99t working, and it will give you the conviction to stick with a company even if the market doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like it. All of this is crucial to getting back to even, Cramer said, because due diligence helps you balance the need to protect your money with the need to risk capital in order to make more. And not to mention, often times even the most venerable Wall Street professionals don\xe2\x80\x99t know their portfolios as well as you will if you do the homework. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if that\xe2\x80\x99s not an edge,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what an edge is.\xe2\x80\x9dCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

Capital levels broadly are higher than at any other time in the last 50 years. An investor can currently buy money center banks in several cases at a discount to liquidation value (tangible book value) and get the ongoing franchises for free. No matter how in?flux their franchises might be, the only way these stock prices can be rationally justified is if assets are fraudulently priced on the banks\xe2\x80\x99 books (highly unlikely after four years of regulatory and auditor scrutiny) or the US economy is about to collapse (also highly unlikely given the aggressive Fed stance and lack of cyclical excesses in the economy). Europe is not going to blow up. While problems certainly exist, there is no smoldering \xe2\x80\x9cLehman Moment\xe2\x80\x9d coming. Authorities are galvanized on both sides of the pond to meet any potential crisis. The recent ECB funding is a lifeline to weaker institutions and allows those banks the time to sell assets and recapitalize in an orderly fashion. Further, even if Europe were to fall into a significant recession, this has never \xe2\x80\x9cpushed\xe2\x80\x9d the US into recession historically. Only 10% of US GDP is tied directly to Europe; if Europe suffers a 2% contraction, the impact on US GDP should be de minimis. The US economy is getting better. Recent data have consistently exceeded expectations(employment, retail sales, etc.) despite the best efforts of the markets and the media to scare the pants off of the average American consumer. Are \xe2\x80\x9cJoe Six?Pack\xe2\x80\x9d and his girl really going to alter their spending patterns because the Italian 10 year yield is breaking over 7%? All Americans really care about is whether they have a job, and well over 2 million new jobs have been created this year. Strangely enough, the only Americans who appear to have had their behavior impacted by the news from Europe are corporate CEOs. This is clear in the Q3 GDP data. Corporations ran down inventories in preparation for a material consumer slowdown that never came. Corporate America has had to play catch up in the 4th quarter to meet normalized consumer demand.

Well, no. But he did hang around with Jack Kemp and others during the early 1980s in what became known as the Opportunity Society. So Newt\xe2\x80\x99s bona fides are there.

2548,The Difference Between a Stock and Its Underlying Company,Mad Money,29-12-2011,"Cramer wants to help investors make money, so he though it important to reiterate a basic concept about stock picking: Companies are analyzed, but never traded because the company and its stock are never the same thing.\xe2\x80\x9cPeople constantly make the mistake of equating a company with its stock,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cMad Money\xe2\x80\x9d host explained. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of mistake that can absolutely wreck your portfolio, especially in volatile markets where many stocks trade off of big-picture, so-called macro data about the broader global economy rather than what\xe2\x80\x99s known as the micro, meaning information about the actual individual companies behind the stocks.\xe2\x80\x9dWhen a stock gets crushed, Cramer said investors often assume there must be something wrong with the company. Inversely, investors tend to assume the company is doing something right if its stock pops. But many times these moves have nothing to do with the underlying business, he continued.Increases in the earnings estimates for an underlying company, however, is the important determinant of a higher stock price, as nothing correlates more strongly with a rising stock price than earnings estimates. But there are so many other factors that dictate how a stock moves, Cramer said. All sorts of things could make the stock of an improving company fall while the stock of a deteriorating company rises.One factor, Cramer said, is the rise of the exchange-traded fund. This is a basket of stocks from a certain sector. As ETFs become more and more popular, stocks in the same sector often trade in lockstep with each other. So good stocks will trade in tandem with mediocre, even bad stocks.Forced selling is yet another problem, Cramer said. This is when money managers get in a bind and need to raise cash, so they sell en masse, bringing everything else down. Short selling is another factor, he continued. When lots of shorts pile onto a stock and good news about the company comes along, there will likely be a huge short-squeeze.Bottom line: What\xe2\x80\x99s happening with a certain stock isn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x99 necessarily a reflection on the underlying company.Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

2549,Cramer: Every Investor Should Have Exposure to This,Mad Money,28-12-2011,"Every investor should own some gold, Cramer said Wednesday. After all, the precious metal is a hedge against global economic chaos. It's also in high demand from emerging markets and central banks. Perhaps most importantly, though, it's very scarce.There are a number of ways to gain exposure to gold, Cramer said. Investors could buy bullion, the actual bricks of gold, but only if they are rich because it costs a lot of money to store it in a depository bank. Another option is to buy gold coins from the U.S. Mint. Home gamers could also buy the GLD , an exchange-traded fund that owns gold so you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to. The GLD is probably the easiest and most straightforward way to own the precious metal, Cramer said. When it comes to gold miners, Cramer recommends caution because these companies can make mistakes, like any other business. Even with gold prices going higher, picking the wrong miner might not make you as much money as the GLD might have. He can't get behind any miners right now, though.When this story was published, Drew Sandholm owned the GLD.Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

Blame the European crisis, or lingering U.S. economic doldrums, or whatever you want, but the dollar  is on track to finish the year about 2% higher than when the year began. And the euro, \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0which at one point seemed headed for 1.50 against the dollar, is down roughly 3% for the year. The greenback is hardly the strongest major currency. Those honors go to the yen, which rose more than 5 percent against the dollar despite the best efforts of the Bank of Japan to stem its rise, and which ranks as the best G10 currency investment of 2011. And it's not like the dollar has suddenly become a favorite: much of its relative strength came from the simple fact that the euro has recently taken a pounding, and the buck could lose its advantage if Europe resolves its crisis or a U.S. economic recovery takes hold.For this year, though, the dollar deriders have been dead wrong.

2557,Cramer's 'Must Own' For Your Portfolio,Mad Money,30-12-2011,"Investors need to own at least one stock with a big, high-yielding dividend, Cramer said Friday.""Dividend paying stocks may not be as sexy as speculation or high-octane growth names, but you know what?"" asked Cramer. ""Who needs sex appeal, dividends work.""The ""Mad Money"" host said that buying high yielders and then reinvesting the dividends is ""one of the greatest ways to make money out there."" It allows one's investment to compound over time, meaning the money from your dividends pays dividends. Although some think high-yielding stocks are to generate income for retirement, but Cramer said that since January 1926, roughly 40 percent of the return from the S&P 500 came from reinvested dividends. He thinks high yielders are safe because as the share price falls, the yield increases and eventually gets to a level where it\xe2\x80\x99s too attractive for investors to ignore. Cramer also likes accidental high-yielders, which are stocks that yield more than 4%. When their share price falls, the yield increases. That's why he likes stocks of companies that have recently raised their dividends, as a dividend hike is one of the clearest signals management can send about the strength of the business.""A company that can raise its dividend is one that has steady, reliable growth,"" Cramer said. ""Equally important, it\xe2\x80\x99s a company that you can be pretty darned sure won\xe2\x80\x99t be cutting the dividend anytime soon.""When it comes to high-yielding dividend stocks, Cramer said that while high yields are attractive, it can also be a sign that the dividend is unsustainable and will have to be cut. To determine whether or not the dividend is safe, he recommends looking at the earnings per share. If a company has earnings that are greater than twice its dividend payout, Cramer said it can likely sustain the dividend even in lean times when the earnings shrink. If the earnings aren't greater than twice the dividend payout, look at the cash flow. Companies with a lot of depreciation and amortization costs will likely have lower earnings. It's also important to examine the balance sheet to ensure there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a lot of debt coming due in the near future that could necessitate a dividend cut, he said.To collect the dividend, Cramer said the only date you should care about is the ""must own"" date. This is the last day you can buy a stock to claim its next dividend payout and it's always the day before the ex-date.""You absolutely must own a high-yielder,"" Cramer said. ""Dividends protect your stocks, and they\xe2\x80\x99re also a terrific way to make money.""Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

2558,Cramer: Benefits of Speculative Stocks,Mad Money,30-12-2011,"In Cramerica, owning one speculative play is part of ""investing orthodoxy,"" Cramer said Friday.""There's an undeniable mystique to owning something that trades in the single digits,"" said the ""Mad Money"" host. ""They allow you to stay engaged and keep your head in the game.""High-risk, high-reward speculative stocks keep investing interesting, Cramer noted. These stocks can generate ""enormous gains"" when done correctly, but they can also bring ""gut-wrenching losses"" when mistakes are made. There are two kinds of stocks in the single-digit space: Those that have been shunned by institutional money managers and the relatively unknown stocks of undiscovered companies.Money managers fear the downside of stocks that appear broken, so they will not invest in single-digit stocks. Their pessimism allows investors to benefit from this ""classic mispricing,"" Cramer said. When the fundamentals of these companies start to turn, investors can buy them at ""terrific"" prices because the ""big boys"" won't go near them. Take Ford Motor , for example, which dropped to roughly $4 a share during the financial crisis or when Bank of America  hit a generational bottom at $3 a share in March 2009.""All of these stocks were supposed to be trash, they were dumpster juice,"" Cramer said. ""But if you went dumpster diving, then you caught doubles or triples in all of them.""When it comes to speculative stocks, Cramer said the overall goal is to invest in tiny, largely unknown companies in sectors that could catch a turnaround. That way, if Wall Street starts showing love to the sector you have a speculative play in, you can hopefully profit from large gains. These speculative fads happen quickly and don't often last long, so Cramer said it's important to take profits when you have them. At the same rate, it is wise to cut your losses before you get burned too badly. When you speculate, Cramer said you don't want to buy and hold forever. Instead, investors should look for something that's going higher and when it does, ring the register.Owning something speculative can help you to starve off boredom and possibly bring large profits, Cramer said.""Lots of fantastic stocks started as speculations,"" he noted. ""Just because a stock trades at $3 doesn't mean it's three card monte. It could be a triple waiting to happen.""Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

""We're lagging behind everyone.""Even if the U.S. was leading the world, Cramer said he'd still want to have a purely foreign play for the sake of ""international diversification."" When considering what foreign stock to invest in, he said doesn't necessarily have to be a Chinese, Indian or Brazilian company, even though those countries are where the growth is. A Cramerican could buy a Canadian stock, if they ""don't want to stray too far from home."" Canada has one of the healthiest economies right now, he noted.""The country doesn't matter as long as it isn't here,"" Cramer said.

2579,Cramer's Most Important Lesson In Investing,Mad Money,30-12-2011,"The single most important concept in investing, Cramer said Friday, is diversification.""If your portfolio is properly diversified, then you can handle just about any setback,"" he said. ""You can come back from any financial disaster.""There are simple ways investors can achieve diversification, Cramer said. Make sure that no one sector or segment of the economy should account for more than 20 percent of your portfolio. If two stocks trade together or seem to move based on the same factors, your portfolio is not diversified. The goal is to spread your money across unrelated stocks, so when something happens that causes one of them to do down hard, the rest should remain relatively unscathed or even go higher. This the ""traditional view"" on diversification, Cramer said, and it's mandatory.Investors should also consider the ""new diversification"" method, as Cramer coined it. For maximum protection and maximum upside, investors need to be in these five areas: gold, a dividend-paying stock with a high-yield, a growth stock, a speculative play and something foreign.Gold tends to go up when everything else goes down, Cramer explained. He likened it to an insurance policy against economic or geopolitical chaos, uncertainty and inflation. When other stocks would fall in response to such calamities, gold tends to rise. Owning gold minimizing your risk to the downside, he said. Consider getting into the precious metal through the SPDR Gold Shares  exchange-traded fund.Cramer said investors could also asked their broker about buying bullion, which is the actual physical bars of gold. He added that buying bullion only makes sense for investors, who can afford to buy in bulk and pay for the bricks to be stored in a depository bank.If interested in gold miners, the ""Mad Money"" host recommends looking for companies with low costs and production growth. He warned that the miners are often prone to an array of setbacks, including debt, mismanagement and the like, but investors who do their homework can often avoid these issues. Nevertheless, Cramer isn't recommending any gold mining stocks right now.""To make sure your portfolio works in any kind of market, you need to own some gold as insurance,"" Cramer said.When this story was published, Drew Sandholm owned the GLD.Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

2580,Profits In Growth Stocks,Mad Money,30-12-2011,"In a market that's become increasingly volatile, Cramer recommends investing in secular growth stocks. Unlike cyclical growth names, earnings for secular growth stocks aren't reliant on how the market is performing and will even continue to expand during a slowdown.Investors analyze growth by considering expected future earnings per share, Cramer said. The basic valuation algebra is the share price, P, equals the earnings per share, E, times the multiple, M. The multiple, by the way, tells investors what they're willing to pay for the company's future earnings. The most important determinant of the price to earnings multiple, Cramer said, is the company's growth rate. He said investors will pay a bigger multiple for businesses with higher growth because the growth means they will get larger in the foreseen future. In general, a secular growth stock can trade up to a multiple that's twice the long-term growth rate before it becomes too expensive. So if the company is growing its earnings per share at a 20 percent clip, its stock won't trade down to a multiple of less than one times its growth rate unless there's something wrong with its fundamentals. If you own a growth stock, Cramer said, be sensitive to which direction the earnings estimates are going and at what pace. Stocks can soar to new high after new high, he noted, but only remain cheap so long as the analysts who cover them are raising their earnings per share estimates fast enough. When estimates have momentum, a stock could double in twelve months and the multiple would be lower than where it started because the earnings estimates increased even faster than the share price. That momentum allows the stock to resist the downward pull of an ugly economy, Cramer said. If the multiple compresses, he recommends selling instead of riding the stock down.""To build a portfolio that can work in every kind of market, you need a fast grower,"" Cramer said.Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

On this last trading day of 2011, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to thank all of you for reading and responding to my many posts. You make what we do worthwhile. Thank you. For many years, I have selected and invested (personally) in ten of the stocks we follow and hold them for the full year. I thought you might like to see this year\xe2\x80\x99s names. Last year\xe2\x80\x99s list lagged the S&P, so there are NEVER any guarantees. Investment success depends a lot on discipline, so I will continue to be diligent. Please keep in mind that results have been good in some years and not as good in others. I will sell my 2011 names and buy the following list this afternoon. These are not recommendations to buy or sell securities. There is always a risk of losing principal. Past performance is no indication of future results. If you are interested in any of these names, please call us or your financial advisor to discuss. All prices are as of 12/29/11 closing. Danaher (DHR - $47.48) Danaher  is a globally diversified manufacturer of professional, medical, industrial and commercial products and services. While the company is heavily dependent on acquisitions for its growth, management has a clearly-defined and proven process for the identification and integration of acquisition targets. The combination of solid organic sales growth, acquisitions, and margin expansion has enabled the company to post an annual growth rate of 17% in earnings-per-share over the past 10 years. Looking forward, our analysis of Danaher\xe2\x80\x99s end markets suggests that the company should be less sensitive to a slowdown in domestic consumer spending in the future. In addition, we expect earnings growth to benefit from the recent acquisition of Beckman Coulter \xe2\x80\x93 the largest acquisition in the company\xe2\x80\x99s history. The combination of a highly visible and defensive earnings stream and a reasonable valuation of 14.5x the consensus estimate for 2012 make Danaher attractive for 2012. Wal-Mart (WMT - $59.99) Shares of Wal-Mart  are still trading at roughly the same level that they were ten years ago despite the company growing earnings-per-share at an annual rate of nearly 12% over that time. At current levels, the stock trades in line with the market multiple of slightly over 12x the consensus estimate for 2012. We believe the company is an above-average company and should trade at an above-average multiple. The company should continue to benefit from the US consumer's new-found frugality, which is a function of high unemployment, stagnant wages, income disparity, tight consumer credit and inadequate retirement savings. As investors begin to more fully appreciate the magnitude of our current economic challenges, we believe WMT's recent outperformance will continue. Furthermore, we believe the stock is relatively defensive. And finally, we are also attracted to the fact that about a quarter of company revenues comes from outside the US. Goldman Sachs (GS - $91.01) The trials and tribulations of Goldman Sachs  have been well documented since the beginning of the financial crisis. And while we are not without our concerns, especially with regard to the company\xe2\x80\x99s heavy dependence on proprietary trading, we also believe that the current valuation is far too compelling given the company\xe2\x80\x99s status as best-in-breed investment bank. As such, we believe GS will be able to generate return on equity in the low- to mid-teens over a cycle \xe2\x80\x93 well below historical returns of 20%+, but still attractive. Given this level of profitability, we believe the shares are trading at an unreasonably low 77% of tangible book value. Moreover, the company has a very dynamic and flexible business model, extremely strong capital and liquidity levels, and a network of alumni that spans the political spectrum. Given these attributes, we are comfortable including GS in our top 10 for 2012. ",https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/30/farr-my-top-ten-stocks-for-2012.html

""That's a nice seasonality to work with,"" he says. Fundamental and political factors are also weighing on the euro, Busch says, so he wants to sell it against the dollar.

2615,Cramer\xe2\x80\x99s Winning S&P Stock,Mad Money,03-01-2012,"Cabot Oil & Gas and Intuitive Surgical were the top two performers of the S&P 500 in 2011, excluding companies that were taken over, \xe2\x80\x9cMad Money\xe2\x80\x9d host Jim Cramer said Tuesday. But which of the two is the winner in his book?Cramer used a number of factors to make that determination and assigned points to each one.1. PEG RatioCabot Oil & Gas 4 points; Intuitive Surgical 2 points.Intuitive Surgical , which makes a robotic surgical system called the Da Vinci, sells for 33 times forward earnings, with a 20 percent growth rate. That gives it a PEG of 1.7. Cabot Oil & Gas , an independent oil and gas play, sells for 31 times forward earnings with a 34 percent growth rate. That gives it a PEG of just 0.09. Cramer\xe2\x80\x99s rule of thumb is never to pay more than two times growth for even the best companies. ISRG is on the high end and COG is extremely cheap. While both companies have growth opportunities ahead, he thinks there\xe2\x80\x99s more risk that Intuitive Surgical will slow down once its Da Vinci saturates the market. Cabot Oil & Gas has some infrastructure issues to contend with, but should be able to sustain its rapid growth rate.2. Take-out PotentialCabot Oil & Gas 2 points; Intuitive Surgical 1 point.Another important factor is the likelihood that the companies could be bought for a big premium, Cramer said. ISRG has an expensive valuation and is a big company, with an $18 billion market capitalization. Cabot, on the other hand, has a $8 billion market cap and hot shale properties, and is similar to other recent takeover targets in this space. 3. Prospective Homeruns in the PipelineCabot Oil & Gas 3 points; Intuitive Surgical 1 point. Cabot has some of the biggest acreage in the business and will continue to drill new wells. While ISRG has some new products coming, Cramer said none of them are game-changers.4. DividendsCabot Oil & Gas 0 points, Intuitive Surgical 2 points. Both names have negligible dividends right now, but Cramer thinks as ISRG matures, it should be able to return a lot of cash to shareholders. Cabot, however, will likely use any extra cash for exploring for more oil and gas. The bottom line\xe2\x80\x94Cramer\xe2\x80\x99s S&P winner is Cabot Oil & Gas.

2628,AT&T: Best Performing Dow Stock In 2012?,Mad Money,03-01-2012,"AT&T could rank among the best performing Dow stocks in 2012, Cramer said Tuesday. The wireless communications company\xe2\x80\x99s stock  had been a laggard in 2011 thanks to the collapse of its plans to acquire rival T-Mobile USA. In March 2011, AT&T announced plans to purchase T-Mobile from Deutsche Telekom  of Germany for $39 billion. Had the deal gone through, AT&T would have become the largest cellphone company in the U.S. AT&T\xe2\x80\x99s proposal was met with opposition from the\xc2\xa0 Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission, though. In August 2011, the Justice Department sued to block the merger, saying it would reduce competition and lead to higher prices. Months later, the companies withdrew their application to the Federal Communications Commission after its chairman also opposed the deal. The FCC claimed the merger would result in a massive loss of U.S. jobs and investment, and significantly diminish competition, while the DOJ said it would lead to higher wireless prices for consumers and businesses.After facing such fierce opposition from government regulators, AT&T last month ended its proposed purchase of T-Mobile.But the stock is now pricing in market share losses that haven\xe2\x80\x99t happened, so the \xe2\x80\x9cMad Money\xe2\x80\x9d host thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s just way too cheap at current levels.\xe2\x80\x9cNow the company can go back to focusing on the fundamentals, building its business with small deals, and coining money courtesy of its near-duopoly status in wireless,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said.AT&T also pays a juicy dividend yield. Cramer tends to like high-yielding stocks because they pay investors to wait until the stock market calms and the economy improves.

2642,Your Crash Course In Euro Break-Up Talk,Money in Motion,03-01-2012,"With experts talking openly about a potential breakup of the euro zone, here's the vocabulary you need to be in the know.If only a new year meant a fresh start for the euro zone. Instead, many strategists see further euro  weakness ahead, and talk of a potential breakup is continuing. That's why you need to brush up your...no, not Shakespeare, but the terms you'll need to talk about an end to the currency union. Luckily, Jens Nordvig, global head of G10 FX strategy for Nomura Securities, has published a lengthy analysis of euro zone break-up issues that should help. Here goes. 1. The big bang breakup, or full-blown breakup, is as scary as it sounds. That's the scenario under which the euro simply ceases to exist, as opposed to a partial breakup in which only a few countries exit the single currency.2. Consensual withdrawal would take place if a country took itself out of the euro in a legally accepted way, possibly using a clause in the Lisbon Treaty. 3. Remember the ECU? That was the basket of individual currencies that preceded the euro, sort of a transitional object that carried countries from their own currencies to the single currency trading today. Nordvig thinks a break-up could be facilitated if euro zone members agreed to create a sort of ECU-2 so that valuations could be established for new national currencies. Trivia point: ECU stood for European Currency Unit but also was pronounced the same as an old French coin - probably one reason the euro has a more neutral name. Some things never change.4. Lex Monetae - Yes, you're getting a Latin lesson. This is the legal principle that says a country has the right to issue its own currency, and exercises jurisdiction over same. The European Union's laws cover the euro, but countries that exit the euro would have jurisdiction over their own national currencies.\xc2\xa0 5. Redenomination - the process of converting the price of an asset from one currency to another. This term can cause headaches, or worse.6. Sequential breakup - a scenario in which the euro zone comes apart in drips and drabs. While you should know the term, Nordvig doesn't think it's likely to happen. ""Such an \xe2\x80\x98onion peeling process\xe2\x80\x99, during which weaker euro zone countries gradually exit, is likely to come to a halt when the process reaches one of the larger euro zone countries, such as Italy or Spain,"" he writes. ""At this point, we think the process would likely become uncontrollable and lead to a big bang collapse, including the core countries."" 7. Unilateral withdrawal would take place if a country withdraws from the euro without waiting for legal approval. Now, plenty of experts don't think a breakup is likely. Nordvig himself, despite being extremely bearish on the euro itself says that while the risk of break-up rose significantly in 2011, ""a break-up of the euro zone is not our central case."" Still, there is general consensus that 2012 will be a rocky year on the Continent.\xc2\xa0 Study your vocabulary, and fasten your seatbelts.Tune In: CNBC's ""Money in Motion Currency Trading"" airs on Fridays at 5:30pm and repeats on Saturdays at 7pm.

2685,Six Ways TVs of The Future Will Become More Intelligent,Tech Check,04-01-2012,"Aside from 3D, HDTV, and color, changes in television set technology have been slow and subtle over the years, but with today\xe2\x80\x99s changing tech landscape, TVs of the not-so-distant future could be intuitive, interactive devices that \xe2\x80\x9cwatch us.\xe2\x80\x9d With the annual Consumer Electronics Show just around the corner, let\xe2\x80\x99s look at some of the ways in which we can expect TVs to change.1. TVs Will Watch You and Learn What You Like to Watch It might take some face recognition technology already being demonstrated in the latest version of Android (Ice Cream Sandwich), Apple\xe2\x80\x99s iPhoto and even Facebook, combined with some machine learning and AI technology but imagine how useful it would be if your TV could watch you for a change, learning all about your viewing behavior including likes and dislikes. After becoming familiar with your TV viewing preferences, your TV could become a virtual assistant for you, recommending programs or incorporating recommendations from your network of friends. 2. TVs Will Understand Gestures and Voice As long as your TV is watching you maybe it will apply gesture recognition technology similar to what Microsoft has developed for its Kinect game controller and allow you to interact with your TV by waving your hand or nodding your head and of course there\xe2\x80\x99s always Apple\xe2\x80\x99s Siri technology so you can have a dialog with your TV using natural language commands to instruct your TV what to do. 3. Recommendation Engines and Proactive RecordingThe same recommendation technology we find so useful in web sites like Amazon , Yelp, Netflix , Retrevo and others will find its way into the TV of tomorrow. \xe2\x80\x9cCloud,\xe2\x80\x9d recording of shows on a DVR may become less necessary however, for first run shows like news, sporting events and award shows there will remain a need to record shows and whether the DVR is built into your TV or it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the cloud, your TV should be aware of what you record and what you end up watching so it can make recordings for you without you setting up the recording. A truly intelligent TV would record shows for you that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t even ask to record or discover shows in the cloud that it thinks you might want to watch. In other words your TV could tell you, \xe2\x80\x9cI took the liberty of recording a new show I thought you\xe2\x80\x99d want to watch.\xe2\x80\x9d ",https://www.cnbc.com/2012/01/04/six-ways-tvs-of-the-future-will-become-more-intelligent.html

2704,How to Trade Asian Currencies Now,Money in Motion,04-01-2012,"By several measures, Asian currencies are bargains - but be careful.China may be allowing the yuan \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0to rise, but the currency strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch say it has plenty of room to keep strengthening - and other Asian currencies are even more undervalued. The strategists estimate that both the Philippine peso  and the Thai baht  are at least 20 percent undervalued, with the South Korean won  and the Malaysian ringgit  each undervalued by roughly 12 percent. Serious bargains, right? Won't the yuan bring other Asian currencies along for the ride? Not so fast, the strategists say. ""One lesson to be drawn from 2011 is that even with CNY appreciation, broader Asia FX appreciation is not necessarily guaranteed,"" they wrote in a note to clients. ""This currency block remains very pro-cyclical and vulnerable to negative growth shocks from G10. We are forecasting a difficult start to 2012.""That's why the Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists recommend being short the South Korean won and the Malaysian ringgit against the dollar. There is an outside risk that China's growth could beat expectations, they say, but barring that, they believe the won could drop 6 percent against the dollar, and the ringgit roughly 3 percent.Remember what Mom said: just because it's cheap doesn't mean it's a bargain.Tune In: CNBC's ""Money in Motion Currency Trading"" airs on Fridays at 5:30pm and repeats on Saturdays at 7pm.

2705,Which Presidential Candidate Is Best for Stocks?,Mad Money,04-01-2012,"Following the Iowa caucus, Cramer on Wednesday contemplated which presidential candidate could be best for the stock market. But in the end, he thinks that despite who wins the White House, just one thing matters to investors and that is certainty.To start, Cramer thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s important investors know who is going to win. So even if the economy falters because of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s debt crisis or if U.S. jobless claims rise, investors can worry less because they will have a good idea of who the next president will be. The market likes to know who it\xe2\x80\x99s dealing with, he said.If President Barack Obama wins another term, Cramer would sell bank stocks because he thinks the big banks could get broken up or penalized to the point where they will have no earnings to speak of. He would also sell health care stocks because even if the U.S. Supreme Court doesn\xe2\x80\x99t overturn \xe2\x80\x9cObamacare,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer thinks the president will figure a way to reinstate it. Cramer would also be leery of oil-related plays because it\xe2\x80\x99s likely the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will be tougher on oil companies if Obama gets reelected. The EPA could, for example, ban fracking for natural gas.On the other hand, Cramer thinks there are still are bull markets to be found, even if Obama gets a second term. Should that happen, he would recommend buying dividend-paying stocks. He also would like the dollar stores and other discount retailers, such as Ross  and TJX Companies .\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to like gold  under Obama because he's perceived as someone who can't build a consensus around radical budget cutting which means we will come closer and closer to our own liquidity problems,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat will really serve to boost gold as I suspect that the bond vigilantes will come here after they have tortured Europe.\xe2\x80\x9dShould former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney win the presidential election, Cramer thinks investors will have a greater selection of stocks to buy. He would invest in oil and gas names, for example, because he\xe2\x80\x99s fairly certain Romney will embrace natural gas as a transportation fuel. Investors could also buy bank stocks because Cramer is betting Romney will \xe2\x80\x9cdefang\xe2\x80\x9d Dodd-Frank, the financial regulatory reform bill Obama signed into law.The bottom line?\xe2\x80\x9cUntil we get certainty or at least clarity, we are going to be buying stocks and selling them depending on every poll, the worst possible scenario,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainty puts an end to that. We will then be in shape to pick the stocks that will go higher, no matter what and the places where the bull market will live will be readily evident.\xe2\x80\x9d",https://www.cnbc.com/2012/01/04/which-presidential-candidate-is-best-for-stocks.html

2714,China Set to Bolster Short Selling,Business News,04-01-2012,"China is poised to unveil measures to bolster the country\xe2\x80\x99s nascent short-selling industry in an effort to deepen its capital markets, according to securities officials and fund managers.Beijing will create a new body called the Centralised Securities Lending Exchange to facilitate short selling as early as this quarter. China Securities Regulatory Commission, the market regulator, will be the largest shareholder in the body, which was first mooted last year.Short sellers sell borrowed shares in the hope of reaping a profit by buying the equivalent securities back later at a lower price and returning them to the lender.The practice has been curbed in some markets on the grounds it can exacerbate volatility, and Beijing has care to retain control of its introduction and development. Defenders of the practice say it increases liquidity and provides income for shareholders who are willing to lend their securities.China embraced short selling in 2010, but efforts to promote its use have been hampered by the limited number of shares available for qualified asset managers to borrow.Other shareholders in the CSLE will include the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, as well as brokerage firms and other financial institutions. It is not clear which firms will be involved, but in early 2010 just six had licenses to engage in securities lending and margin financing. At the end of that year, only 25 brokerages had licenses to provide a broader array of prime services.The new centralized lending exchange will make shares available to qualified fund managers in China who wish to borrow them, for a fee. It will source the shares from institutions in China including banks, insurers and fund management firms.Currently, qualified fund managers can only borrow shares owned by brokerage firms. Both parties must meet high asset requirements, discouraging such activity. Margin financing also remains under-developed, with just 285 stocks are allowed to be traded on margin.Securities firms believe Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s move will spur the development of the hedge fund industry. China\xe2\x80\x99s hedge fund industry is dominated by less regulated \xe2\x80\x9csunshine funds\xe2\x80\x9d, which target wealthy individuals and are the closest thing China has to hedge funds. According to The Securities Association of China, there were 400 such funds operating at the end of 2010.According to Chinese brokerage executives, the timing of the introduction of the new measures may also have been affected by the recent leadership shuffle at the CSRC which saw Guo Shuqing, the former chairman of China Construction Bank, become the regulatory body\xe2\x80\x99s new chairman.Some asset managers say the prospect of the new rules was one reason that Chinese stock markets were among the world\xe2\x80\x99s worst performers in 2011, with the Shanghai Composite index down almost 22 per cent for the year.Additional reporting by Simon Rabinovitch in Beijing",https://www.cnbc.com/2012/01/04/china-set-to-bolster-short-selling.html

""The December PMI data are encouraging as they suggest that growth is not collapsing, but in both cases there is no reason to expect an immediate improvement."" Jerram cites several macroeconomic problems that continue to plague the two Asian economic powerhouses, such as inflation and growth.Research firm Capital Economics points out that beyond China and India, PMI data for other countries offers a much more mixed picture. Production levels have declined in Taiwan, Singapore and Korea. In the case of Korea, manufacturing activity shrunk by the most in three years. According to the firm, although the biggest jump in PMI was recorded in India, the positive readings are marred by ""a string of disappointments"" in other indicators for the country such as industrial production, exports, and auto production. Yet there are some signs of a silver lining, according to HSBC's Co-head of Asian Economics, Frederic Neumann. He believes the data has ""brightened the picture everywhere.""In a note to clients, Neumann said November was a bleak month for Asian economies but in December, ""new orders have improved again almost everywhere."" He said inventories appear to have dipped and new export orders showed signs of life as well.Neumann admits that an improvement in the ISM alone won't boost the region's growth.

Its products are found in 99 percent of American households, Cramer said. Some investors may think this company sounds boring, but Cramer noted that boring, dividend-paying stocks were the savior of many individual\xe2\x80\x99s portfolios last year. After all, high-yielding stocks pay investors to wait until the stock market calms and the economy improves. So no matter what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the world, dividend-paying stocks are still turning investors a profit. For its part, Kraft sports a 3.1 percent dividend yield.In addition to Kraft\xe2\x80\x99s dividend, Cramer likes the stock because of the company\xe2\x80\x99s plans to break-up. He thinks management can unlock value by splitting the company into two parts: a fast-growing snacks company called SnackCo. and a domestic grocery business named GroceryCo. The split won\xe2\x80\x99t likely happen until the end of the year, but in the meantime, Cramer thinks Kraft\xe2\x80\x99s stock will rise in anticipation.

But job growth is incredibly important because, 1) When people get hired, they become more confident, 2) A more confident consumer means more spending on goods and services, which will benefit sectors across the board, 3) Small businesses are more likely to be created in a healthy job environment.\xe2\x80\x9cGrowth means a system that's been left for dead, our banking system, gets revived because the sheer number of bad loans finally begins to shrink,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer continued. \xe2\x80\x9cCapital gets built. The result? Our banks become healthier. Maybe even healthy enough to withstand or at least offset the weakness of the European banks and the potentially defaulting sovereign debt issuers.\xe2\x80\x9dBefore the market had job growth to turn to, it had nothing to counterweight Europe\xe2\x80\x99s debt woes. So even as Europe\xe2\x80\x99s problems are still significant, Cramer said they are less significant to the market because domestic banks have so much capital. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.\xe2\x80\x94CNBC.com and Reuters contributed to this reportCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

You'll soon be acquainted with NFC \xe2\x80\x94 which could transform the way we shop, pay, save, and interact with other mobile device users and even with physical objects. NFC is the technology that enables smartphones and other devices to establish a radio connection by touching them together or coming within close proximity. NFC technology has not been heavily adopted in the U.S. yet, but according to some analysts\xe2\x80\x99 estimates there will be a greater push for mobile users to adopt the technology in the next few years. John Devlin, a NFC analyst at ABI Research, said that he expects the number of NFC handsets to increase from about 34 million this year to about 80 million next year. Mark Hung, an analyst for Gartner, sees the growth in handsets exceeding 100 million in 2012.

Google partnered with Citibank, Mastercard, First Data, VeriFone , Samsung and Sprint among other companies, to make the wallet possible.

Reporters are not making this up. The economy is better. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to give President Obama a leg up on the election. GOP beware, and come to your senses.Take Friday\xe2\x80\x99s jobsreport from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nonfarm payrolls gained 200,000 and the unemployment rate slipped to 8.5 percent from 8.7 percent. It may well be that a seasonal quirk added 42,000 messengers and couriers to the totals, but that will be lost in the headline reporting. It will be given back next month. It\xe2\x80\x99s inconsequential to the overall story. Likewise, a normal labor participation rate would yield much higher unemployment . But that\xe2\x80\x99s academic. Like any president, Mr. Obama will take credit for these economic gains. He\xe2\x80\x99s doing that right now. And he has a case to make: A year ago the unemployment rate was 9.4 percent, and in 2011 it fell almost a percentage point. In the twelve months through December 2011, the economy produced 1.64 million new jobs, while in 2010, only 940,000 were created. On a monthly average basis, 137,000 new jobs per month were created in 2011, compared to only 78,000 a month in 2010. Things are getting better. Now, whether this has anything to do with Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s policies is quite another matter. After all, coming out of a deep recession, monthly jobs should be closer to 300,000 or 400,000, as they were during the Reagan recovery in 1983-84. The unemployment rate should be falling much faster. This should be the Republican message.

2831,Morici: Unemployment Falls to 8.5 Percent but that May Be as Good as It Gets,The Guest Blog,06-01-2012,"The economy added 200,000 jobsin December, and unemployment rate fell to 8.5 percent. Going forward unemployment is not likely to fall much further and may rise again.Fourth quarter growth was exceptionally strong as the global economy recovered from first half disruptions such as the earthquake in Japan, but going forward economists expect growth to slow to about 2 percent. Job growth in the range of 130,000 should be expected to accommodate labor force growth but not much lower the unemployment rate. That is hardly a pace that will restore economic health, or validate President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s heavy intervention in the economy and industrial policies in the upcoming Presidential campaign. The unemployment rate  would be higher but for the fact that many unemployed professionals have established home-based businesses that really don\xe2\x80\x99t provide full time employment but do take workers off the unemployment rolls. Also, many adults have quit looking for work altogether, and the adult labor force participation rate remains depressed. In December, working age adults not participating in the labor force\xe2\x80\x94those neither employed nor looking for work\xe2\x80\x94increased by 194,000, almost as many as who found jobs. Strong gainswere notched in retail and wholesale trade, warehousing and transportation, leisure and hospitality, and health care and social services. Manufacturing added 23,000 jobs and construction added 17,000. Gains in manufacturing production are not accompanied by stronger improvements in employment largely because so much of the growth is focused in high-value activity. Assembly work, outside the auto patch, remains handicapped by the exchange rate situation with the Chinese yuan. The situation with the yuan  is the single largest impediment to more robust growth in manufacturing and its broader multiplier effects for the rest of the economy; the Obama Administration indicated over the holidays it has no intention of challenging China on this issue, and it enjoys the unlikely support of Speaker John Boehner. Government employment fell by 12,000 as private sector jobs added 212,000. Lower property values translate into lower assessments and property values with considerable lag in most communities, and 2013, the housing recession will dramatically reduce local tax receipts and employment. Coupled with federal budget cutbacks, government employment should fall by about 20,000 a month through the end of 2012. The private sector less the heavily subsidized health care and social services industries, and temporary businesses services, only added 191,000 jobs. In the months ahead, gains in core private sector employment must improve dramatically if the economy is to halt the decline in real wages and provide federal, state and local governments with adequate revenues, and that is not happening fast enough. The economic crisis in Europeand mounting problems in China\xe2\x80\x99s housing sector and banks worries U.S. businesses about a second major recession and discourages new hiring. The U.S. economy continues to expand but is quite vulnerable to shock waves from crises in European and Asia. Factoring in those discouraged adults and others working part time for lack of full time opportunities, the unemployment rate is about 15.2 percent. Adding college graduates in low skill positions, like counterwork at Starbucks , and the unemployment rate is likely closer to 18 percent Prospects for lowering those dreadful statistics remain slim. The economy must add 13 million jobs over the next three years\xe2\x80\x94360,000 each month\xe2\x80\x94to bring unemployment down to 6 percent. Considering continuing layoffs at state and local governments and federal spending cuts, private sector jobs must increase about 385,000 a month to accomplish that goal. Growth in the range of 4 to 5 percent is needed to get unemployment downs to 6 percent over the next several years. In fourth quarter of 2011, the economy grew at about 3 percent but that is expected to slow to 2 percent in 2012. Growth is weak and jobs are in jeopardy, because temporary tax cuts, stimulus spending, large federal deficits, expensive and ineffective business regulations, and costly health care mandates do not address structural problems holding back dynamic growth and jobs creation\xe2\x80\x94the huge trade deficit and dysfunctional energy policies.

2837,Farr: The Fed is Creating Moral Hazard,The Guest Blog,06-01-2012,"Federal Reserve intervention in the economy has profound implications for not only the prices of goods and services, but also financial assets. The Fed has kept the Fed Funds rate at close to zero for over three years now, with a promise to remain low at least through the middle of next year. As a result, investors across the globe are forced into risky assets that offer better return potential. This rotation of money into stocks, commodities, high yield bonds, real estate, etc, has lifted the prices of these assets relative to where prices would be otherwise. And higher asset prices have been supportive of our economic recovery. However, the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s action does not come without risk. Many economists believe that the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s large-scale monetary policy (to include rate cuts and \xe2\x80\x9cQuantitative Easing\xe2\x80\x9d  ) will eventually lead to widespread inflationary pressures across the economy. Others say that forcing investors into risky assets could lead to asset bubbles the likes of which we are very familiar with by now. At the very least, we think the Fed is creating a problem of \xe2\x80\x9cmoral hazard\xe2\x80\x9d which may be difficult to unwind in the future. Old, anachronistic investors believed that they could, under certain circumstances, lose all of their money when making an investment. But the notion of \xe2\x80\x9ccaveat emptor\xe2\x80\x9d seems to have been lost as the Federal Reserve, Treasury Department, and Congress joined forces to save the financial system. Investors learned that the stock market was far too important to the consumer psyche to let it fall too far. Investors also learned that many companies, and therefore investments in those companies, were simply \xe2\x80\x9ctoo big to fail\xe2\x80\x9d.

2851,"Blog: Break Out the Budgets, Study Reveals US Consumers Increasingly Overleveraged ",The Guest Blog,06-01-2012,"During the third fiscal quarter of 2011, U.S. consumers added $17 billion in new credit card debt, wiping out what remained of a $33 billion first-quarter pay down and putting us on pace for a $64 billion net gain in credit card debt during 2011, according to a Card Hub study. First-quarter debt pay downs are typical, as the first fiscal quarter of the year is when companies give out yearly salary bonuses, the IRS serves up tax refunds, and we\xe2\x80\x99re still committed to New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Resolutions. But in neither 2009 nor 2010 was a first-quarter pay down consumed entirely by the close of the year\xe2\x80\x99s penultimate quarter. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, according to the aforementioned study, the amount of new credit card debt incurred during Q3 2011 was 58 percent and 154 percent higher than what was added during Q3 2009 and Q3 2010, respectively. These trends clearly display that overleveraging of unsecured credit cardsis getting out of hand. This may not pose an immediate threat, but what happens if the European debt crisis sours and unemployment starts to go back up? In order to help avoid a repeat of Great Recession difficulties, which hurt everyone from small business owners to big banks like Citi and Bank of America , we need to address the problem now. The first hurdle many consumers must overcome is a mental one. We all need to come to terms with the fact that pre-recession spending habits were not \xe2\x80\x9cnormal,\xe2\x80\x9d so as economic confidence grows, anyone whose income was in any way, shape or form connected to the housing bubblecannot simply revert back to \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d spending. Instead, current saving-mode fiscal conservatism will have to become the new reality. The second hurdle is a little more practical, though it too requires a change in perspective. If you currently spend more than you bring in, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to make a budget. That means forgoing things to which you have become accustomed, but that are not necessary. The questions you need to pose to yourself when evaluating existing discretionary expenses as well as new ones: Will not having this hurt me on a daily basis? Use this test to identify and cut your most expendable expenses until your after-tax monthly income exceeds your planned monthly spending.

But their terrible plans are here to stay,\xe2\x80\x9d was the declaration that greeted readers who went to the newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s Web site to get caucus updates. On Wednesday, after waiting until the dust in Iowa had settled, clearing out space in newspapers and on television, Mr. Obama delivered another jab, announcing four recess appointments, including that of Richard Cordray as head of a new consumer protection agency, despite Republican opposition. On Thursday, the president went to the Pentagon and outlined a new military strategy that embraces hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to what is a Republican sacred cow, and made it clear that American ground forces would no longer be large enough to conduct prolonged, large-scale counterinsurgency campaigns like those in Iraq and Afghanistan. On Friday, he will take a victory lap with Mr. Cordray in a visit with the staff of the new Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. White House and administration officials insist that all of Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s actions this week \xe2\x80\x94 with the exception of the advertisement \xe2\x80\x94 are policy decisions made for the good of the country. But from Marine One \xe2\x80\x94 the helicopter where Mr. Obama and Mr. Cordray revved up on Wednesday for the forthcoming fight \xe2\x80\x94 to the West Wing corridors to his campaign offices in Chicago, the president\xe2\x80\x99s battle for re-election is quickly escalating as he sets out to use the advantages of his office to full effect. The president\xe2\x80\x99s move last fall to take his jobs plan on the road to try to sell it to the American public, an effort that culminated in the extension battle that is now widely perceived as a win for Mr. Obama and a debacle for Congressional Republicans, was just the beginning, administration officials and Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s advisers say.

2867,Jobs Outlook in Small Business: Let's Review,Small Business,06-01-2012,"It was a week where just when you thought you knew what the story was, it changed. So, let\xe2\x80\x99s review:We\xe2\x80\x99ll start with jobs. Overall, 200,000 new jobs were created in December, and the unemployment rate dropped to 8.5 percent, surprising many who expected that number to rise after the holiday hiring spree. No doubt hiring was up in December, a fact that was attributable, in part, to small business, according to at least one economist. Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial, echoed her theory from last month regarding the ADP payroll report, which noted that in December, 325,000 private-sector jobs were added. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s good news and that story continues to grow,\xe2\x80\x9d she told CNBC.com\xe2\x80\x99s Patti Domm. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s one we want to keep momentum on, and that\xe2\x80\x99s small business formation \xe2\x80\xa6 That\xe2\x80\x99s seen a real turn.\xe2\x80\x9d ",https://www.cnbc.com/2012/01/06/jobs-outlook-in-small-business-lets-review.html

2873,4 Dow Stocks to Outperform In 2012,Mad Money,06-01-2012,"As all three averages logged strong gains to close the first week of the new year, Cramer on Friday revealed the four stocks he expects to outperform the Dow Jones industrial average  in 2012.General ElectricMany of General Electric\xe2\x80\x99s businesses seem likely to do well in the year ahead, Cramer said. The Fairfield, Conn.-based company is engaged in\xc2\xa0 energy infrastructure, integrated electrical equipment, aerospace and much more.Meanwhile, the company recently raised its dividend by 13.3 percent. The stock currently sports a 3.7 percent dividend yield.Finally, Cramer thinks the stock is \xe2\x80\x9cdirt cheap.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s selling for 11.7 times forward earnings, which is cheap compared to its 13.4 percent long-term growth rate. Plus, it\xe2\x80\x99s trading at a 20 percent discount to its historical multiple.Kraft FoodsBased in Northfield, Ill., Kraft is the largest packaged food company in the United States. Its products are found in 99 percent of American households, Cramer said. Some investors may think this company sounds boring, but Cramer noted that boring, dividend-paying stocks were the savior of many individual\xe2\x80\x99s portfolios last year. After all, high-yielding stocks pay investors to wait until the stock market calms and the economy improves. So no matter what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the world, dividend-paying stocks are still turning investors a profit. For its part, Kraft sports a 3.1 percent dividend yield.In addition to Kraft\xe2\x80\x99s dividend, Cramer likes the stock because of the company\xe2\x80\x99s plans to break-up. He thinks management can unlock value by splitting the company into two parts: a fast-growing snacks company called SnackCo. and a domestic grocery business named GroceryCo. The split won\xe2\x80\x99t likely happen until the end of the year, but in the meantime, Cramer thinks Kraft\xe2\x80\x99s stock will rise in anticipation. So he thinks the stock is a great buy at current levels and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if it outperforms the Dow.AT&TThe wireless communications company\xe2\x80\x99s stock had been a laggard in 2011 thanks to the collapse of its plans to acquire rival T-Mobile USA. In March 2011, AT&T announced plans to purchase T-Mobile from Deutsche Telekom  of Germany for $39 billion. Had the deal gone through, AT&T would have become the largest cellphone company in the U.S. AT&T\xe2\x80\x99s proposal was met with opposition from the\xc2\xa0 Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission, though. In August 2011, the Justice Department sued to block the merger, saying it would reduce competition and lead to higher prices. Months later, the companies withdrew their application to the Federal Communications Commission after its chairman also opposed the deal. The FCC claimed the merger would result in a massive loss of U.S. jobs and investment, and significantly diminish competition, while the DOJ said it would lead to higher wireless prices for consumers and businesses.After facing such fierce opposition from government regulators, AT&T last month ended its proposed purchase of T-Mobile.But the stock is now pricing in market share losses that haven\xe2\x80\x99t happened, so the \xe2\x80\x9cMad Money\xe2\x80\x9d host thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s just way too cheap at current levels.\xe2\x80\x9cNow the company can go back to focusing on the fundamentals, building its business with small deals, and coining money courtesy of its near-duopoly status in wireless,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said.AT&T also pays a juicy dividend yield. Cramer tends to like high-yielding stocks because they pay investors to wait until the stock market calms and the economy improves. The dividends can be reinvested into the stock.BoeingThe airplane maker is posed to have one of its best years in ages, the ""Mad Money"" host said, because it is benefitting from the powerful aerospace cycle. Right now, airlines desperately need to buy the latest fuel-efficient planes in order to reduce sky-high fuel costs.

He thinks 2012 will be just as profitable because commercial airplane orders rose by 52 percent last year to 805 aircraft and the company had a backlog of 3,771 planes in the pipeline. Looking ahead, the new orders should only continue to grow.Another reason Cramer likes Boeing is because it pays a dividend. Last month, the company raised its dividend by 5 percent.

Rebecca Patterson, chief markets strategist for J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Institutional, agrees. ""In recent months, when the ECB did cut, the euro fell. But when policy makers are seen as not acting fast enough to stem the crisis, the euro falls anyway,"" she says. ""It's a matter of degree but not direction.""The picture in the U.S. is very different, Bourdeau says, noting that comments from Federal Reserve officials next week are likely to highlight the differences between the prospects for the U.S. and European economies - with the dollar reaping some benefit.Bourdeau wants to sell the euro against the dollar,  entering the trade at 1.2760 and looking for a move to 1.2500, with a stop at 1.2830.\xc2\xa0 ",https://www.cnbc.com/2012/01/06/can-super-mario-save-the-euro.html

2924,Politics Up Close and Almost Personal,Politics,09-01-2012,"MANCHESTER, N. H. \xe2\x80\x94 Newt Gingrich has bright purple cheeks. Rick Santorum has a comb sticking out of his back pocket.Jon Huntsman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes are looking extremely red. Ron Paul\xe2\x80\x99s son, Rand, the senator, is much shorter in person. And Mitt Romney, according to rope-line reports, has very soft hands \xe2\x80\x94 though probably not as big as the \xe2\x80\x9cenormous hands\xe2\x80\x9d of Mr. Santorum\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather, whom the candidate invokes as a recurring parable (\xe2\x80\x9cThose hands dug freedom for me\xe2\x80\x9d). This data emerged in recent days because the presidential campaign trail remains, for a few fleeting moments before Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s primary, up close and intimate \xe2\x80\x94 or intimate-ish. The candidate-consumer transaction remains sufficiently close-in so people can ask questions of the hopefuls and survey their mannerisms at varied events in drivable distances. Early presidential voting has become a full-on amusement spectacle in America, where political hobbyists can buy T-shirts from licensed vendors and ask would-be presidents to hold a pose with them for several seconds while Grandma tries to figure out how to get this iPhone machine to take a picture (\xe2\x80\x9cOh wait, that one didn\xe2\x80\x99t come out either, Governor\xe2\x80\x9d). It will not be like this again for a long time. After Tuesday, the campaign will enter the ether zone of media otherness, just another reality show where it will be next to impossible to approach Callista Gingrich and have her sign your copy of her children\xe2\x80\x99s book, the one with Ellis the Elephant. If campaigns are a feast, these last days before the New Hampshire primary are a smorgasbord of cotton candy, mixed nuts and red meat. What follows is a weekend sampling of the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s offerings, beginning Friday and ending Sunday. (Rick Perry, who has not been campaigning in New Hampshire, is not included.) The Paul PosseFriday, 2 p.m., Hangar Rally for Representative Ron Paul of Texas, Nashua Airport, Nashua. Before introducing candidate/Daddy Ron Paul at an airport rally, Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, addressed a matter on everyone\xe2\x80\x99s minds: his own hair. He told of how a woman back home had recently grabbed him by his stiffly tousled mane. When he asked her what she was doing, she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI just wanted to check to see if it was a toupee or not.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s not clear why young Mr. Paul told this story Friday in Nashua, though perhaps to reinforce the Ron Paul campaign\xe2\x80\x99s message of authenticity (\xe2\x80\x9cHair\xe2\x80\x99s real, so\xe2\x80\x99s Dad\xe2\x80\x9d). Whatever, the crowd loved it \xe2\x80\x94 as they love everything Paul, especially Daddy Ron, who moseyed out in a professorial gray blazer a few minutes later to echoing screams. Supporters waved blue \xe2\x80\x9cRon Paul\xe2\x80\x9d placards, flags and \xe2\x80\x9cpeace\xe2\x80\x9d signs (actual printed signs, not two fingers). In an insistent drawl, Daddy Paul hits his big notes early. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I can think about is how freedom is popular,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, admiring the typical Paul Posse mix of \xe2\x80\x9cOccupy\xe2\x80\x9d types, (both pro and anti-Paul) military veterans, self-taught historians, skateboard hipsters and graying peaceniks. Mr. Paul stands mostly still at the lectern while his themes swing from his performance in Iowa to the wisdom of silver as a currency. He is the slightly doddering teacher who\xe2\x80\x99s been around forever, meanders through the hour and yet holds the class rapt. He rails against \xe2\x80\x9cthem\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 whom he characterizes as \xe2\x80\x9cthe people who want to run our lives, police the world and spend us into bankruptcy.\xe2\x80\x9d By a big margin, the Paul Posse is the most devoted and passionate of any candidate crowd. They are less \xe2\x80\x9csupporters\xe2\x80\x9d than followers. \xe2\x80\x9cI came even though I have a special-needs dog at home,\xe2\x80\x9d explains Jackie Casey, of Nashua. The special-needs dog \xe2\x80\x94 a Shar-Pei named Tori \xe2\x80\x94 is very old, over 100 in people years. Tori is almost blind, suffers from anxiety attacks and requires a great deal of care. And yet Ms. Casey, a former Army reservist who now works at a Dunkin\xe2\x80\x99 Donuts, would not have missed this. \xe2\x80\x9cRon Paul is the only one running for president who has not lied,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.

2925,Oil Prices Could Soar 80% If Iran Shut Hormuz: Analyst,Behind the Money,09-01-2012,"If Iran were to shut down the Strait of Hormuz, a key oil transportation route where millions of barrels travel out of the Persian Gulf every day, Brent crude would surge to between $150 and $200 a barrel, according to an oil analyst with Societe Generale.\xe2\x80\x9cWe believe it would be relatively easy for Iran to shut down the Straits of Hormuz,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Michael Wittner, in a report late Friday to clients. \xe2\x80\x9cA credible threat from missiles, mines, or fast attack boats is all it would take for tanker insurers to stop coverage, which would halt tanker traffic. However, we believe that Iran would not be able to keep the Straits shut for longer than two weeks, due to a US-led military response.\xe2\x80\x9dHowever, the analyst puts this aggressive action as a low probability event. The more likely scenario is an embargo imposed by the European Union, accompanied by U.S. pressure on other countries to do the same, which could still send Brent prices to the $125 to $150 range. Brent was trading above $112 a barrel on Monday.\xe2\x80\x9cAnEU embargo is considered likely, especially after the EU reached an agreement in principle on an embargo on January 4th,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote the analyst. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen it is announced, depending on the timing and details, we may revise our base case oil price forecast upward.\xe2\x80\x9dMore than 15 million barrels a day flow through the strait, making it one of the most (if not THE most) important points for oil delivery in the world. Its North coast is made up of Iran, which recently announced that it has started uranium enrichment at one of its Nuclear plants, further inviting sanctions by Western nations.Traders see the European embargo and the way Iran responds to it as keeping a bottom under oil prices for much of 2012.\xe2\x80\x9cAt no point during the year would I suggest going home short crude,\xe2\x80\x9d said David Greenberg, president of Greenberg Capital and former member of the NYMEX board. \xe2\x80\x9cWe could easily open $25 higher on the Brent market\xe2\x80\x9d following a drastic move by Iran.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For the best market insight, catch 'Fast Money' each night at 5pm ET, and the \xe2\x80\x98Halftime Report\xe2\x80\x99 each afternoon at 12:00 ET on CNBC.

2942,PAC Ads to Attack Romney as Predatory Capitalist,Politics,09-01-2012,"MANCHESTER, N.H. \xe2\x80\x94 Thanks to a $5 million donation from a wealthy casino owner, a group supporting Newt Gingrich plans to place advertisements in South Carolina this week attacking Mitt Romney as a predatory capitalist who destroyed jobs and communities, a full-scale Republican assault on Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s business background.The advertisements, a counterpunch to a campaign waged against Mr. Gingrich by a group backing Mr. Romney, will be built on excerpts from a scathing movie about Bain Capital, the private equity firm Mr. Romney once ran. The movie, financed by a Republican operative opposed to Mr. Romney, includes emotional interviews with people who lost jobs at companies that Bain bought and later sold. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had to load up the U-Haul because we done lost our home,\xe2\x80\x9d one woman says. Democrats have signaled that they intend to make Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s history at Bain a central part of their case against him if he wins the Republican nomination. But Bain has also emerged as an issue in the Republican primary, despite the party\xe2\x80\x99s free market stance and business-friendly policies, reflecting the depth of public anger about the economy. At an appearance here on Sunday, Mr. Gingrich suggested that Bain\xe2\x80\x99s approach was to carry out \xe2\x80\x9cclever legal ways to loot a company.\xe2\x80\x9d But the planned advertisements appear to be intended to elevate the subject to a new level as Mr. Gingrich and the other Republican contenders begin to run out of time to slow Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s progress toward the nomination. They are the latest example of how \xe2\x80\x9csuper PACs\xe2\x80\x9d are carrying out attacks in sync with their preferred candidates and in the process helping to reshape the presidential race. Super PACs can raise unlimited amounts of money but are barred from coordinating with the campaigns they are supporting. The Bain-centered campaign strikes at the heart of Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s argument for his qualifications as president \xe2\x80\x94 that as a successful executive in the private sector, he learned how to create jobs \xe2\x80\x94 and advances an argument that President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s re-election campaign has signaled it will employ aggressively against Mr. Romney. \xe2\x80\x9cHis business success comes from raiding and destroying businesses \xe2\x80\x94 putting people out of work, stealing their health care,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rick Tyler, a senior adviser to the pro-Gingrich super PAC, Winning Our Future, which recently bought the film, \xe2\x80\x9cKing of Bain: When Mitt Romney Came to Town,\xe2\x80\x9d after groups backing two other Republican candidates passed up opportunities to use it.

2964,"Strength In Tech, Financials Means Rally",Mad Money,09-01-2012,"Should the technology and financial sectors see continued strength, Cramer on Monday said the overall stock market could rally. Given a few indicators, it seems that could very well happen, too.Although both tech and financials were among the worst laggards for the latter half of 2011, the two sectors have been acting like leaders in 2012. Nevertheless, nobody expects much from either and the average analyst on Wall Street has incredibly low expectations for tech and financial companies, not including Apple , U.S. Bancorp  and Wells Fargo . The expectations are so low for these two sectors that Cramer thinks most companies will actually be able to beat on earnings.It would be hard for stocks to rally without strength in the tech and financial space. After all, tech is the biggest component of the S&P 500 , accounting for roughly 17.5 percent of the index. The banks, a major part of the financial sector, make up around 12.4 percent of the S&P.So what\xe2\x80\x99s the bottom line?\xe2\x80\x9cThe biggest surprise of 2012 could be that the financials, the most hated group out there, can actually soar,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf that happens, the leaders, like USB and Wells Fargo can really romp, particularly now that the largest market cap bank, and the de facto winner, is Wells.\xe2\x80\x9cApple and Wells Fargo, they are the purloined letters of this market, hidden right in plain sight and ready for the grabbing.\xe2\x80\x9d",https://www.cnbc.com/2012/01/09/strength-in-tech-financials-means-rally.html

2967,Breakout: S&P 500\xe2\x80\x99s Highest Close Since July Could Fuel More Buying,Behind the Money,10-01-2012,"The S&P 500 closed above its closing high hit last October, a technical breakout that could spark more buying, chart analysts and traders said. How much buying, though, is subject to debate.It could go \xe2\x80\x9ca lot higher,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dennis Gartman, whose The Gartman Letter is usually filled with analysis of charts. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to see a bit more volume, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take what I can get.\xe2\x80\x9dNow at the highest since July, the benchmark leaves behind a 2 \xc2\xbd month trading range it was trapped in as concerns about the European financial crisis continued to push it down. The market is pricing in an improvement in the U.S. economy and good results in the upcoming earnings season, traders said.\xe2\x80\x9cWe are probably looking at new all-time highs on the S&P 500 by the end of the year,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam Grimes, chief investment officer for Waverly Advisors. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is significant technical support and justification for such a rally, and we are now in area that justifies a more aggressive stance on risk, as opposed to our hands-off attitude of the past several months.\xe2\x80\x9dAlcoa, the first Dow Jones Industrial Average member to report 4th quarter results, kicked of the earnings season right, gaining after it predicted strong aluminum demand this year. The PowerShares QQQ Trust \xc2\xa0, which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 Index, is about 1 percent from breaking out to a new high. A breakout by the more volatile security could mark a true return to the risk trade.\xe2\x80\x9cLook at the QQQ's for an animal spirits gauge,\xe2\x80\x9d said Josh Brown, a trader with Fusion Analytics and author of the popular  blog. \xe2\x80\x9cThe more times it tries to break through, the bigger the eventual breakout. If it breaks $59 to $60, this is a new 11-year high and the whole market will go crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d ---------------------------------------------------------------------NEW SLIDESHOW: The Biggest Momentum Stocks of 2011: Buy or Sell?---------------------------------------------------------------------For the best market insight, catch 'Fast Money' each night at 5pm ET, and the \xe2\x80\x98Halftime Report\xe2\x80\x99 each afternoon at 12:00 ET on CNBC.

2968,Playing a Potential Housing Resurgence,Mad Money,09-01-2012,"There may soon be a housing resurgence, Cramer said Monday, at least if bullish comments from prominent businessmen and recent data are any indicator.Jack Welch joined the group of notable businessmen, who think housing could soon turn around. The former CEO of General Electric made bullish comments on housing while appearing on CNBC Monday. Meanwhile, pending home sales recently hit its highest level in 19 months. The National Association of Realtors\xe2\x80\x99 existing home sales index rose by 7.3 percent from October to November while experts had only expected an increase of just 1 percent.To play this potential housing resurgence, Cramer suggests Weyerhaeuser. The second-largest owner of timberland in the United States, Cramer said it\xe2\x80\x99s more profitable and productive than its competitors. Cramer said its successes are, in a part, due to its fabulous management team.The timber company\xe2\x80\x99s stock sports a 3.2 percent dividend yield. It\xe2\x80\x99s cheap, too, trading at a 30 percent discount to its net asset value.

2970,Dollar-Reserve Dumping? Not So Much,Money in Motion,10-01-2012,"Funny what a European debt crisis can do to the appeal of the dollar.It wasn't so long ago that experts were predicting that the dollar would soon cease to be a major reserve currency. Well, don't hold your breath. Data released at the very end of 2011 show that dollar reserves were maintaining at roughly 61.7 percent of all reserves at the end of the third quarter, while euro  reserves declined by about 0.9 percent in the first nine months of 2011, and 1.5 percent since the beginning of the debt crisis. Now, the dollar isn't exactly winning popularity contests. While Switzerland and Japan added to their dollar holdings, developing countries shed dollars, according to an analysis by Alan Ruskin, global head of G10 FX strategy at Deutsche Bank.Still, he says, other major currencies like the yen  have been unable to break into the reserve-currency big leagues, making reserves increasingly the province of the dollar and the euro. And the overall trend right now, he says, ""fits with thoughts that the glacial reduction in the USD reserve status has flattened out, while the EUR\xe2\x80\x99s reserve share has peaked, and more tentatively taken over a \xe2\x80\x98glacial\xe2\x80\x99 decline trend from the USD, that has potential to accelerate.""Ruskin doesn't see demand for euro reserves picking up until there are clear signs of resolution of the debt crisis.----------------------------CURRENCY FUTURESTune In: CNBC's ""Money in Motion Currency Trading"" airs on Fridays at 5:30pm and repeats on Saturdays at 7pm.

Be it production disruptions in Libya or instability in Iraq, Cramer thinks there will always be some geopolitical mess on the horizon that will send oil higher. Around the world, there is just too much demand for oil and not enough supply, which is why Cramer likes oil and gas driller Key Energy Services.The Houston-based company is what\xe2\x80\x99s known as a well servicing contractor, meaning it does pretty much everything needed to keep oil wells working, including maintenance or repair. With 787 rigs in operation, It\xe2\x80\x99s actually the largest operator of onshore well service rigs in the U.S. Cramer likes Key Energy Services because it\xe2\x80\x99s engaged in hydraulic fracking, which is the controversial drilling technique performed in oil-rich shales. Fracking is a crucial part of horizontal drilling, a method that\xe2\x80\x99s more complicated than traditional drilling. The oil wells created by horizontal drilling are up to five times more service intensive than conventional wells and that means more business for Key Energy Services.Right now, KEG is trading off its 52-week high and is selling for just 9.7 times forward earnings with a 12 percent long-term growth rate.

In a blistering report in 2010, SEC Inspector General H. David Kotz accused Barasch of repeatedly derailing or downplaying investigations of Stanford, who in 2009 was accused of running a $7 billion Ponzi scheme.Under dual civil settlements with the SEC and the Justice Department that could be finalized as soon as this week, Barasch would pay a $50,000 fine and agree to a six-month ban on practicing before the SEC, the source said. It is the harshest penalty available under the law.Barasch, currently a partner with the law firm Andrews Kurth, did not immediately respond to calls or an e-mail seeking comment.According to Kotz\xe2\x80\x99s report, after Barasch left the SEC in 2005, he repeatedly sought to represent Stanford even after the agency\xe2\x80\x99s ethics office told him it was improper. Barasch represented Stanford anyway \xe2\x80\x94 briefly \xe2\x80\x94 in 2006.In his report, Kotz said that when he asked Barasch why he was so interested in representing Stanford, he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cEvery lawyer in Texas and beyond is going to get rich over this case. Okay? And I hated being on the sidelines.\xe2\x80\x9d Kotz found SEC staffers were first alerted to potential problems with Stanford as far back as 1997, but did not take action against him until 12 years later.

This is good news for Romney on two fronts.One, he clearly destroyed the rest of the field in a state that has a primary more akin to the general election compared to Iowa. Two, the conservative Republicans are all staying in the race and divide the conservative vote.

It\xe2\x80\x99s not stellar, he admits, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a safe yield even if housing stays flat in the year ahead.Masco\xe2\x80\x99s stock currently sells for 38 times this year\xe2\x80\x99s earnings estimates, a sky-high multiple, especially for a company with a 15 percent long-term growth rate. But with this kind of cyclical stock, Cramer said it\xe2\x80\x99s best to buy when the price-to-earnings multiple is at its highest because that means earnings are depressed.

3050,"What Cramer Expects of Spanish, Italian Bonds",Mad Money,11-01-2012,"The stock market is on edge ahead of the first debt sales of 2012, as Spanish and Italian bond auctions are scheduled to take place on Thursday and Friday.Euro zone debt sales always seem to have a big impact on market sentiment, but ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer is curious if that will still be the case in the new year. The debt auctions from Spain and Italy this week will test the appetite for the bonds of the two countries at the forefront of the Europe's sovereign debtcrisis. Spain sells up to 5 billion euros of 2015 and 2016 paper on Thursday, while Italy offers up to 4.75 billion euros of five-year bonds on Friday.Elsewhere in the market, U.S. December retail sales numbers will be released on Thursday. Cramer doesn't think it will be as important to the market as the European auctions will be, but positive data could help counterweight any bad news out of Europe. Nevertheless, the aggregate sales number isn't likely to be as good as how individual retail names have been doing lately. So if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t invested in the sector yet, Cramer would wait for a what could be a disappointing number before taking the plunge into retail. For those interested, Cramer prefers retailers Macy\xe2\x80\x99s , TJX Companies  and Ross Stores .Finally, Cramer also plans to monitor Domino\xe2\x80\x99s Pizzaearnings results on Thursday.

We expect this situation to get worse before it gets better,"" they wrote in a note to clients.Europe isn't creating the only headwinds. The strategists say Canada's housing market is overvalued, and while they don't expect a crash, ""this situation may serve to exacerbate any large external shock should prices fall rapidly.""

3071,Cramer: Wait Out the Rally,Mad Money,10-01-2012,"As Wall Street hit a five-month high on Tuesday, Cramer told his \xe2\x80\x9cMad Money\xe2\x80\x9d viewers to wait for a pullback before buying any more stocks.\xe2\x80\x9cAs much as I would love to tell you that a new year means new fundamentals, we are still stuck with the same old ones and for the most part the good news is beginning to be reflected in the price action, while the risks are no longer as evident in the market as they should be,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer explained, adding that even though the market will likely continue to climb, it may not be wise to participate in it.A lot of things have changed for the better, though, such as full capitulation by the Chinese government where a number of stocks hit their lows. The Chinese government suggested it\xe2\x80\x99s done cooling its economy, prompting the metals to trade higher. On the belief copper is in short supply in China, copper miners Freeport-McMoRan  and Southern Copper  saw shares spike. With China\xe2\x80\x99s non-residential construction firing back up, industrial stocks like Caterpillar , Cummins  and Joy Global  saw gains. More power plants will be built in China, too, benefiting companies like General Electric .Another positive helping the market is strong U.S. auto sales data, Cramer noted. Auto parts maker BorgWarner  and plastics maker Honeywell International  are starting to see a pickup.Meanwhile, Cramer thinks the U.S. housing market may be turning around. If this proves true, he said it could be a major engine of job growth.While these three things have changed for the better, Europe\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign debt crisis lingers. In addition, two of the hottest sectors this year \xe2\x80\x94 technology and financials \xe2\x80\x94 have Cramer worried. Early earnings reports suggest there may have been another downturn in spending on tech, Cramer said, and earnings being reported by the banks suggest the numbers will have to be lowered. Finally, the price of oil is not going up because of demand, but because of supply concerns primarily centered around a potential supply disruption on behalf of Iran and Cramer said he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like that \xe2\x80\x9cone bit.\xe2\x80\x9dThe bottom line?\xe2\x80\x9cI think you have to be willing to miss the next phase of this rally by no longer buying up here, until we pull back and begin to discount the issues that haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed, not just the ones that have,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. \xe2\x80\x9cIgnoring the negatives in 2011 was an expensive proposition, and as much as I like the tone of 2012 so far, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to whistle too loudly past the graveyard.\xe2\x80\x9dWhen this story was published, General Electric owned 49 percent of NBCUniversal, which operates CNBC and Cramer's charitable trust owned Caterpillar and Cummins.Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

3081,Farr: More Government Money? ,The Guest Blog,11-01-2012,"I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the Japanese economy. The federal government has a huge debt burden, and the country\xe2\x80\x99s bonds have suffered credit rating downgrades, yet the yield on the 10-year bond is less than 1%.I asked a well-recognized global economist for a huge US bank to help me understand this seeming paradox.He suggested that Japanese rates would be substantially lower without the downgrade and the country\xe2\x80\x99s ultra-loose monetary policy. While I guess that makes sense academically, I continue to wonder. I mean, how much lower could yields really go from here? Japan comes to mind as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, in a recent letter to Congress, indicated a willingness to pursue additional Quantitative Easing (QE3) and purchase what some suggest may be an additional $750 billion of government-backed mortgage bonds. At present, the simple reinvestment of maturing holdings will provide about $200 billion in new purchases this year. Since 2009, the Fed  has purchased $1.25 trillion in mortgage backed securities  which may have stemmed the bleeding but not healed the wound. Between the housing price peak in 2006 and the first round of Fed purchases in 2009, prices fell about 28%. Since 2009 they have declined an additional 4% for a total drop of 32%. And the price decline may not be over. We have long argued that residential real estate is of lynchpin importance to the US economy and its recovery. The ongoing bursting of the housing bubble has been the first punch of a classic one-two combo that led to a banking collapse uppercut. Housing represents a meaningful portion of GDP and, other than her job, is the largest asset most Americans have. As the value of one\xe2\x80\x99s largest asset declines, confidence is undermined and a source savings is impaired. In a consumer-driven economy, this blow to the ability and willingness to spend is crucial. To many, Japan\xe2\x80\x99s economic policyhas failed because its economy remains at stall-speed. Yet it may be that Japan would be in a far worse condition had it not taken the steps it has. In the US, many suggest that the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s Quantitative Easing has failed and are perplexed as to why they would consider pursuing such failed policy. BUT, it may be that Quantitative Easing and the huge mortgage-backed bond purchases have saved us from a far worse fate. While the jury deliberates, we think that the current housing recovery is critical and very fragile. According to Bloomberg, \xe2\x80\x9cWhile the Fed has helped push mortgage rates to record lows of less than 4%, home-loan borrowing in 2012 is forecast to decline to the least in 15 years.\xe2\x80\x9d The supply of credit and the demand for housing remain well below the levels needed to clear the existing housing supply and return the housing market to a healthy state. Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker appeared on CNBC\xe2\x80\x99s Squawk Boxwith Steve Liesman this morning and said that \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fed doesn\xe2\x80\x99t control growth.\xe2\x80\x9d I agree, and I also believe that the markets have become far too preoccupied with the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s next move. The Fed has played a very important role in stabilizing our economy and financial systems, and it continues to do so today. However, the economy and markets will only return to a healthy state when investors shift focus from anticipating government\xe2\x80\x99s next move to anticipating organic improvement in corporate earnings.

3106,The Pattern Trap,Money in Motion,12-01-2012,"Correlations can help you trade, but they can also come back to bite.Sorry, Hayley Mills, it's not just parents who get trapped. Currency investors spend a lot of time looking for correlations, either between currencies, or between currencies and other assets. It's often useful because a view on one asset can point the way to a trade on the other - but these patterns can also mess you up. Take the euro-dollar pair  and the S&P 500 index. Alan Ruskin, global head of G10 foreign-exchange strategy at Deutsche Bank, has examined the performance of the two over the last several months, and found a 79 percent positive correlation in daily percentage changes. Nice, right? But the euro has fallen some 6 percent over that time, while the stock index rose 8 percent. What happened? In a word, volatility. The euro has tended tofall more than the S&P on a given day, and also rise more. But because the falls are steeper, the rises don't fully compensate, and the euro has seriously lagged. ""The last three months provided a clear view of the problems and the opportunities associated with trading correlation and associated products,"" Ruskin says.To avoid this pattern trap, make sure you look at all kinds of correlations, not just the ones that indicate the direction of trades.

Second, if a company\xe2\x80\x99s stock got hammered last year, it is roaring back this year regardless of whether it should be rallying.To Cramer, the first change makes sense, but the second is a little concerning. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think the \xe2\x80\x9cworst to first\xe2\x80\x9d phenomenon is sustainable. The banks, for example, performed terribly last year only to see some pick up yet this year.

The future of TV is niche, and will come through broadband pipes, not the airwaves, according to Kyncl.

He projects that by 2012, 75 percent of all channels will be over the Internet, and ""channels"" will be far less reliant on traditional Hollywood: the new platform is democratizing a previously closed system.

3124,Poll: Mormons like Romney More than Huntsman,Election 2012,12-01-2012,"Americans who identify themselves as Mormons rate former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney much more highly than they do former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr., a new survey finds.Both Republican presidential candidates are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), as the church is formally known.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 While Mormons view Mr. Romney in a very positive light, only 56 percent think Americans are ready to elect someone of their faith as president. Three of five respondents said Americans know little or nothing about their church, and almost half (46 percent) said there is a lot of discrimination against members of their church.These findings come from a new survey of Mormons by the Pew Research Center\xe2\x80\x99s Forum on Religion & Public Life. It is the first such survey ever conducted by a non-LDS research organization.Among Mormons, there is a sharp difference in favorability ratings between Romney and Mr. Huntsman, according to the survey, conducted from Oct. 25 to Nov 16. Some 86 percent view Romney favorably, while only 10 percent view him unfavorably. By contrast, 50 percent have a favorable view of Huntsman, while 24 percent view him unfavorably.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Romney, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, is seen in a much harsher light by the public as a whole, which gives him a 38 percent favorable and a 45 percent unfavorable rating, Pew said. Comparable data were not provided for Huntsman.Both men were viewed in a kinder light by their co-religionists than was Senate majority leader Harry Reid, the most prominent Democrat who is a Mormon. Senator Reid is viewed positively by only 22 percent of Mormons and unfavorably by 51 percent.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The poll did not probe for the reasons behind the differing approval ratings. But the researchers found that 66 percent of Mormons consider themselves conservative, versus 37 percent of the general public. And among Mormons surveyed, 74 percent say they are Republican or lean Republican versus 17 percent who identify with Democrats.\xc2\xa0 Mormons' strong party affiliation with Republicans does not explain why Romney is viewed more favorably than Huntsman. One possible factor, noted by CNN religion editor Dan Gilgoff in a blog, is how each man has described his ties to the religion.Huntsman told Fortune magazine that, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say I am overly religious.\xe2\x80\x9d He added, \xe2\x80\x9cI get satisfaction from many different types of religions and philosophies.\xe2\x80\x9dRomney, on the other hand, is well known for his active role as a lay leader in the Boston area Mormon Church. In a 2007 speech, he noted that some \xe2\x80\x9cwould prefer if I would simply distance myself from my religion, say that it is more a tradition than my personal conviction or disavow one or another of its precepts.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 To which he responded, \xe2\x80\x9cThat I will not do.\xe2\x80\x9dIn one high-profile example of the potential political drawbacks of Romney's faith, the Rev. Robert Jeffress called Mormonism a ""cult"" at the Values Voter Summit in October.While there is a considerable feeling among Mormons of being misunderstood, 63 percent of those surveyed said that acceptance of Mormonism was on the rise. Moreover, Mormons also said that gays and lesbians as well as Muslims suffer more discrimination.Overall, 1.9 percent of US adults describe themselves as Mormon. The survey of 1,019 adult Mormons has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.",https://www.cnbc.com/2012/01/12/poll-mormons-like-romney-more-than-huntsman.html

3150,Republican Rivals Batter Romney in South Carolina ,Politics,12-01-2012,"COLUMBIA, S.C. \xe2\x80\x94 For the Republican presidential candidates who want to stop  in South Carolina, it comes down to this: How far are they willing to go?A day after Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s victory in New Hampshire left his rivals running out of time to block his path to the nomination, he was greeted here by a wave of attacks on his business record, his past support for abortion rights and his character. With little left to lose,  of Texas and their allies sought to portray Mr. Romney as insufficiently steadfast in his conservatism in this very conservative state, threatening a scorched-earth approach to the primary to be held here on Jan. 21. But there were some signs that a pressure campaign from the party establishment \xe2\x80\x94 encouraged and to some degree organized by pro-Romney forces \xe2\x80\x94 was forcing his rivals to recalibrate if not rethink the attacks. A growing chorus of high-profile Republicans criticized the attacks on Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s earlier career buying and selling companies as Democratic talking points. Two days after former  of Utah said that Mr. Romney \xe2\x80\x9clikes firing people,\xe2\x80\x9d The Associated Press reported him as saying on Wednesday: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have creative destruction in capitalism, which has always been part of capitalism, it becomes a little disingenuous to take on Bain Capital,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s former firm. But Mr. Gingrich said he would not back off as an outside \xe2\x80\x9csuper PAC\xe2\x80\x9d supporting him introduced a scathing video about Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s work at Bain. And Mr. Perry kept up his critique of what he has called Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cvulture capitalism.\xe2\x80\x9d It was Day 1 of what is shaping up as a 10-day test of whether conservatives can marshal the arguments, tactics and unity to slow Mr. Romney and rally around a single alternative \xe2\x80\x94 and of whether Mr. Romney, now in a commanding position, can show the muscle needed to stamp out the opposition and take control of the party. Mr. Romney utilized the full force of his formidable campaign machinery to create a backlash against the attacks on his record at Bain. Employing resources no other campaign can match, his Boston headquarters held conference calls with his huge array of endorsers around the nation, sent talking points to supporters and enlisted go-betweens to tell leaders of the pro-Gingrich group Winning Our Future that they were harming the party with the attacks. At the very least, Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s team appeared to have made headway in casting his opponents as abandoning their own party\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding support for the free market. It received backing Wednesday from two political voices that have had the respect of the Tea Party movement here in ways Mr. Romney has not: Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, who has endorsed Mr. Romney, and Senator Jim DeMint, who has not. ",https://www.cnbc.com/2012/01/12/republican-rivals-batter-romney-in-south-carolina.html

3159,Cramer\xe2\x80\x99s Housing Recovery Play,Mad Money,11-01-2012,"Housing has bottomed, Cramer said Wednesday, adding that it could soon turn around.To back his call, the \xe2\x80\x9cMad Money\xe2\x80\x9d host pointed to a few positive signs. On its earnings conference call Wednesday, homebuilder Lennar  reported a 20 percent increase in new orders and a 35 percent jump in its total backlog. In turn, its stock soared and pushed other homebuilder stocks higher, too, leading the Philadelphia Housing Index to break through a key technical level of $111.So if housing is to turn around, Cramer recommend investing in indirect housing plays that pay you to wait until the housing market does bounce back. He likes Fortune Brands Home & Security , which makes kitchen and bath cabinetry, plumbing, windows, doors and more. Last year, new construction drove 20 percent of sales while the repair and remodel markets accounted for 35 percent. So even if housing doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bounce back right away, Fortune will still profit from people fixing up their homes.Fortune\xe2\x80\x99s stock is close to its 52-week high and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem cheap because its selling for 22.6 times earnings, but looks like a better deal when you consider it has a 22 percent long-term growth rate. But Cramer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t recommend investors chase this stock. Instead, he suggests waiting for a pullback before buying shares.Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

3173,El-Erian: Do Friday's European Downgrades Matter? ,The Guest Blog,13-01-2012,"The chatter on Friday's downgrades of European sovereign ratings debtis all over the place - from those dismissing it as old news (especially given that S&P warned back on December 5th) to those viewing it as part of a larger and consequential transformation of the international monetary system. What follows is an attempt to provide a guide to the multi-faceted implications. It focuses on three types of consequences: (i) those that are unambiguous and already reflected, albeit not fully, in market valuations; (ii) those that are less well understood but will become clearer in the next few weeks; and (iii) those that are consequential but where the analytics are still largely unknown at present. The sovereign debt of European sovereigns was already trading at yields consistent not only with what S&P announced today, but also with more draconian downgrades - thus the view that the impact on overall yields and spreads would be contained. Yet there are some differences between signaling an action and actually taking it. First you remove residual uncertainty about the action, including timing and scale. Second, you encourage others to follow. Third, you impact the pattern of investment flows, especially those subject to guidelines and restrictions defined in terms of ratings. All three are relevant for Europe. The net result has both a quantity and price angle: a decline in future investment flows into the Euro-zone, and incremental market pressure that, other things being equal, would be more persistent than would have otherwise been the case. This speaks to a weaker Euro  and recurrent volatility in sovereign spreads. In introducing a rating wedge at the very inner core of the Eurozone, the downgrade of France in particular impacts Pan-European vehicles.

Reconstruction, however, is going to require Sino steel.Politics have stirred up a media storm over the use of foreign steel in the Bay Bridge.

American steel is excellent. So too are the skills of our metallurgists. That\xe2\x80\x99s not the point.

3176,Isn\xe2\x80\x99t a \xe2\x80\x98Bainful\xe2\x80\x99 Turnaround What America Needs? ,Money & Politics with Larry Kudlow,13-01-2012,"There\xe2\x80\x99s a very troubled company out there called U.S. Government, Inc. It\xe2\x80\x99s teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. And it badly needs to be taken over and turned around. It probably even needs the services of a good private-equity firm, with plenty of experience and a reasonably good track record in downsizing, modernizing, shrinking staff, and making substantial changes in management. Yes, layoffs will be a necessary part of the restructuring.A quick look at the income statement of this troubled firm tells the story. Just in the past year (FY 2011) the firm spent $3.7 trillion, but took in only $2.2 trillion in sales revenues. Hence its deficit came to $1.5 trillion. Just in the first three months of the new year (FY 2012), the firm\xe2\x80\x99s troubles continued. Outlays for all purposes came in at $874 billion, but income was only $554 billion. So the shortfall was $320 billion. No hope of a self-imposed turnaround here. Indeed, both the senior management and the board of directors show no signs of making major changes to their business strategy. Hope for future profits? That\xe2\x80\x99s out of the question. The firms only chance of survival is a takeover. Worldwide employment for U.S. Government, Inc. is estimated to be over two million, a completely unmanageable number for a venture like this. Total compensation for this company is roughly twice the level of its private-sector counterparts. And its retirement and health-insurance benefits are so large in relation to contributions paid that its benefit plans are careening toward insolvency. In fact, the total debt of this firm now equals its total income -- an unsustainable position that suggests to many observers that future financing needs will not be met. The product line of this troubled firm has been rejected over and over by growing segments of its customer base. And its product pricing (taxes) is not even remotely competitive. Even worse, heavily unionized work rules and regulations are so onerous that the prospects for even reasonable productivity and efficiency are long gone. Its credit rating? That\xe2\x80\x99s been marked down, with more downgrades expected in the future. The very troubled U.S. Government, Inc. had long been either number one or in the top three worldwide in terms of economic freedom. But as a result of all these deteriorating conditions, it has fallen four years in a row in this category, slipping all the way to tenth. In fact, over the past ten years, the firm has barely grown and its share price has been flat. Without the kind of radical change that comes from a takeover and turnaround, more economic slippage is baked in the cake. Restructuring this company seems a hopeless proposition. But wait a minute. There\xe2\x80\x99s a highly regarded private-equity operation located in Boston that has a good (but not perfect) track record in turning around hopeless ventures. Though there have been failures for this firm, notable successes include Staples , The Sports Authority, Domino\xe2\x80\x99s Pizza , and Steel Dynamics .Anyone operating in business knows full well that even the smartest reorganizing firms are prone to failure as well as success in our free-market capitalist system. But the customer base of the troubled U.S. Government, Inc. seems like it is desperate enough to go the takeover route.

3180,Steinbock: Looking Ahead to D-Day in Greece,The Guest Blog,13-01-2012,"In May 2010, the Eurozone crisis began with turmoil in Greece. In spring 2012, new turmoil in Greece will frame the end-game of the Eurozone itself.On January 16, the representatives of the \xe2\x80\x9cTroika\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 the European Union, International Monetary Fund  and the European Central Bank \xe2\x80\x93 will return to Greece to restart talks with the Greek government on the next loan contract. ""We must see progress on the voluntary restructuring of Greek debt,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a joint news conference with French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Berlin in January 9. \xe2\x80\x9cOtherwise it won't be possible to pay out the next tranche for Greece."" This tranche amounts to EUR 130 billion, and the Greek economy is critically dependent on it. In the absence of radical policy shifts, Athens is heading toward default. Few options left The prospects for cash-strapped Greece look increasingly bleak. Nonetheless, the Troika and the current Greek government hope to stick to the current strategy, which is likely to contribute to continued downward slide \xe2\x80\x93 for the fifth year in the row. Again, there are three options on the table: tougher austerity measures, larger debt restructuring, or additional funds. If the Troika asks the Greeks to impose even tougher austerity measures and Athens goes along, any lingering hopes for growth will be extinguished and social tumult will escalate. If Athens decides to oppose new austerity measures, the dispute over the next tranche will force the default sooner rather than later. The other option \xe2\x80\x93 that the country\xe2\x80\x99s creditors should provide Greece with additional funds\xe2\x80\x93 is no option at all. In the absence of substantial policy shifts, political obstacles against additional funds are growing rapidly in the recessionary environment of the Eurozone. What about the third option? Running behind haircuts Since spring 2010, I, along with others, have spoken for debt restructuring in Greece. For two years, the ECB and most euro leaders shunned all talk about Greek debt restructuring. When the idea was presented to the then-ECB chief Jean-Claude Trichet, he walked out. Last summer, the euro leaders finally did conclude that Greece probably needs a 21% debt reduction. However, time is money and that was too little too late. By then, the more realistic figure was closer to 50%. In the fall, the euro leaders concluded that, actually, what is really needed is a 50% haircut. But precious time had been lost again, and by then the real figure was close to 70-75%. Today, a 50% debt restructuring in Greece is grossly inadequate. What is needed is probably an 85-90% haircut. What went wrong? Unrealistic assumptions The simple answer has to do with assumptions. In May 2010, the Eurozone supported Greece with EUR 110 billion; last year Athens hoped to stay afloat with another bailout round of EUR 109 billion. But neither was sufficient. In October 2011, the Troika concluded in its debt sustainability study that Greece would need another EUR 250 billion in the course of the next decade. At the time, I argued that, given the current policy packages, this was neither viable nor enough. The IMF and the EU determined that Greece\xe2\x80\x99s debt would have to be cut from more than 160% to 120% of GDP to be sustainable. And yet, only weeks after the Troika study, Italy, a major Eurozone economy, was swept by market turmoil, even though its debt-to-GDP was 120%. As far as the Troika was concerned, Athens\xe2\x80\x99 best option was a decade of nightmarish austerity programs that, at best, would result in the kind of market turmoil that had just swept the Italian economy. The simple fact remains that, in order to gain control of the expenditures in the Greek budget and the country\xe2\x80\x99s debt, current revenues would have to exceed expenditures by more than 10% - and that is a figure that not a single industrialized country has achieved in recent past. Greece as an emerging economy In other words, when the most recent Greek restructuring program was approved in last fall, it was dead on arrival. The initial decision to grant Greece membership in the Eurozone was motivated by political considerations, not economics. In the absence of drastic policy shifts, the final decision to permit Greek exit is likely to be motivated by economic considerations, not politics. When the Greek government has to face a choice between a decade of austerity and an Eurozone exit to regain competitiveness, the chances are that the government will choose the latter. In structural terms, the indebted-Greece looks today like an emerging economy. However, this outcome was neither necessary, nor inevitable. A more realistic approach would have spared the Greeks of unnecessary suffering and the Eurozone from unnecessary escalation and contagion.

3200,PACs\xe2\x80\x99 Aid Allows Romney\xe2\x80\x99s Rivals to Extend Race,Politics,13-01-2012,"Under the old political rules, Mitt Romney arrived in South Carolina this week the prohibitive Republican front-runner: flush with cash, awash in endorsements from a party establishment starting to coalesce behind him and buoyed by victories in Iowa and New Hampshire.But as Mr. Romney is quickly learning, those rules no longer apply. Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s carefully tended network of Republican donors has been rendered functionally less important by \xe2\x80\x9csuper PACs,\xe2\x80\x9d through which a handful of wealthy individuals are financing a multimillion-dollar advertising barrage to assail his record and prop up his opponents. And Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s victories in Iowa and New Hampshire have netted him just a handful of the delegates he needs to become the nominee, thanks to the party\xe2\x80\x99s decision last year to lengthen the nominating process by shifting more winner-take-all contests to the end of the primary season. As a result, Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s remaining opponents have little incentive to drop out, knowing that their support from super PACs and Internet contributions from grass-roots supporters can keep them in the race long after they would have remained viable in earlier eras, potentially draining money and delegates away from Mr. Romney even as he lurches toward the nomination. Since the contests began, only one candidate, Representative Michele Bachmann, has pulled out, while two others, Newt Gingrich and Gov. Rick Perry, have failed to break into the top three in Iowa or New Hampshire. \xe2\x80\x9cI think everybody in the race right now has a legitimate shot,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Romney said to reporters at a news conference in South Carolina on Thursday. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I wish them all well.\xe2\x80\x9d  The debut of candidate-aligned super PACs in the Republican primaries has further upended a party already struggling to reconcile its restive Tea Party-inspired grass roots with a traditional party apparatus that is rapidly losing whatever control it once exerted over the process. Enter 'Winning Our Future'On Thursday, even as hundreds of wealthy Republicans gathered in Palm Beach, Fla., and raised an estimated $1.5 million for Mr. Romney the old-fashioned way, a super PAC backing Mr. Gingrich began buying half-hour blocks of advertising time in South Carolina, with preparations to broadcast a scathing video about Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s record as the founder of Bain Capital. The group, Winning Our Future, is armed with $5 million from just a single Gingrich ally, the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. And Mr. Gingrich signaled on Thursday that he would continue his own assaults on Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s private equity days, even as other prominent Republicans \xe2\x80\x94 including Rudolph W. Giuliani and Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina, a Tea Party favorite \xe2\x80\x94 called on him to cease. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to back down or be afraid to say, \xe2\x80\x98We, the American people, have the right to know, and any candidate for president has an obligation to tell us,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Gingrich said at a convention of the elderly in Columbia. Asked if Winning Our Future was keeping him in the race, Mr. Gingrich said that \xe2\x80\x9cit just offsets the other PACs.\xe2\x80\x9d 'Red, White and Blue'He is not necessarily wrong. The Red, White and Blue Fund, an outside group that is promoting the candidacy of Rick Santorum, began advertising in South Carolina before the New Hampshire primary, softening the negative effects of Mr. Santorum\xe2\x80\x99s potentially campaign killing \xe2\x80\x94 at least by the old rules \xe2\x80\x94 poor finish there on Tuesday. On Thursday, the group, which was seeded with a major contribution from Foster Friess, a wealthy mutual fund executive, announced a new investment of $600,000 in television advertising in South Carolina. The group had its largest fund-raising day on Wednesday, officials said, allowing it to expand its reach into all television markets in the state. In a brief interview on Thursday, Mr. Santorum said that he welcomed the support and acknowledged that his allies had kept his candidacy afloat. Asked whether the new investment would improve his chances in South Carolina, his eyes lit up, and he declared, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope so!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWe certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t have the kind of money that these other super PACs have,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Santorum said after a stop in Hilton Head, S.C., \xe2\x80\x9cbut the modest amount that they\xe2\x80\x99re able to put out there will, hopefully, be a help to us.\xe2\x80\x9d 'Our Destiny'While Jon M. Huntsman Jr. has had too little campaign cash to afford substantial advertising, a super PAC supporting him, Our Destiny, helped keep him afloat through New Hampshire and is expected to weigh in for him to some degree in South Carolina. The group has received hundreds of thousands of dollars from Mr. Huntsman\xe2\x80\x99s father, a billionaire industrialist. Officials with Mr. Huntsman\xe2\x80\x99s campaign have conceded that without the help of the super PAC supporting him, they would have had a much harder time competing. But John Weaver, the chief political strategist for Mr. Huntsman, said having Our Destiny\xe2\x80\x99s help was \xe2\x80\x9cnot a clean shot\xe2\x80\x9d because it left the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s strategy in the hands of people it is legally prohibited from coordinating directly with. \xe2\x80\x9cWe would prefer to have the funds within our coffers so we could have direct control of the message,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Weaver said. Mr. Weaver put Mr. Huntsman in a different category than Mr. Gingrich, noting that Mr. Huntsman began rising in the polls just before Election Day in New Hampshire, whereas Mr. Gingrich began a sustained slide weeks beforehand. \xe2\x80\x9cWithout a super PAC, Newt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have left Des Moines,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. The outside help for his rivals may, of course, prove to have an upside for Mr. Romney: By keeping a half-dozen different candidates viable, the super PACs may inadvertently be making it impossible for one of them to emerge as the alternative to him. But the change in the delegate-awarding process means that if Mr. Romney continues to win states only with pluralities, he could face a long nominating fight, as other candidates pick up delegates under new party rules that increase the number of states that award delegates based on vote share. Still, Mr. Romney will himself enjoy the benefit of a well-financed super PAC in his own corner: Restore Our Future, which spent millions of dollars to attack Mr. Gingrich in Iowa and is preparing to spend even more in South Carolina and Florida.

3203,How to Make Your Air Travel Green,Road Warriors,13-01-2012,"For those corporate travelers concerned about climate change \xe2\x80\x94 as well as quarterly profits \xe2\x80\x94frequent air travel may make you uneasy.If you work for Google, Dell,UBS and dozens of other companies, both big and small, sit back and enjoy your flight because your employer has already purchased carbon credits to offset the greenhouse gas emissions created by travel. \xe2\x80\x9cMost of our revenue comes from businesses right now,\xe2\x80\x9d says Eric Carlson, president of  carbonfund.org Foundation. \xe2\x80\x9cThroughout the recession, business interest remained very high and I think that shows the importance of corporate social responsibility in the marketplace as a core part of attracting and retaining customers."" The carbon offset market, a byproduct of the Clean Air Act of 1991, enables consumers to balance their impact on the planet by purchasing tax-deductible credits toward a project that reduces carbon dioxide emissions elsewhere. Those who donate to carbonfund.org, for example, one of several nonprofits that sell carbon credits, can select from the projects it supports. They include ones focused on renewable energy (wind farms), energy efficiency (compact fluorescent light bulbs and technologies to reduce tailpipe emissions from long-haul freight trucks) and reforestation in the Amazon forest and domestic wildlife refuges. \xe2\x80\x9cCarbon offsetting is simply the process of neutralizing your footprint,\xe2\x80\x9d says Carlson, president of carbonfund.org. \xe2\x80\x9cIf your car is responsible for 10,000 pounds of carbon emission, you plant some trees and boom, you\xe2\x80\x99re carbon neutral.\xe2\x80\x9d One carbon credit, he notes, is equal to one metric ton of carbon dioxide, or its equivalent for another greenhouse gas, such as methane, which are widely blamed for climate change. According to the group\xe2\x80\x99s website, a roundtrip flight between New York and Los Angeles would produce 0.89 metric tons of carbon dioxide. As such, the suggested donation to offset that emission is $8.94. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s less than 5 percent of the cost of my flights,\xe2\x80\x9d says Geiger.The cost is also tax deductible, like most other business expenses.Where to Buy ThemAs in most things green these days, the largest companies or those in the sustainability business itself are the most likely to be involved in the carbon offset business. If you want to sign up your employer or your own company, there are plenty of easily available choices.In addition to carbonfund.org, certified carbon credits are marketed by nonprofits including the Nature Conservancyand Bonneville Environmental Foundation, along with climate mitigation services firms TerraPassand 3Degreesinc.com. You can also purchase credits directly from airlines like JetBlue and United, and online travel companies OrbitzandExpedia, when booking tickets online. Prices per credit can vary, depending on how the carbon emission is measured. Some calculators, for example, include all the pollutants generated per flight, while others factor in departure dates (it\xe2\x80\x99s more fuel efficient to fly in July than in January), airline carrier and seat class (economy, business, first class.) For its part, Terrapass in San Francisco aggregates direct donations from its online consumers and corporate partners, like Expedia, and uses those dollars to help emitters, including landfills and dairy farms, reduce their carbon emissions. \xe2\x80\x9cWe establish long-term contracts with them, and help them get the money they need to install capital equipment and implement process changes that reduce their emissions,\xe2\x80\x9d says Terrapass Chief Executive Erin Craig. She says her group helps complete the modifications as well. ",https://www.cnbc.com/2012/01/13/how-to-make-your-air-travel-green.html

The euro  tumbled, of course, but Rebecca Patterson, chief markets strategist for J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Institutional, thinks there's a better way to trade the news: looking at countries that really feel the effects of the euro's troubles.Patterson just returned from a trip to London, she told CNBC's Melissa Lee, and she thinks selling the British pound  makes sense. ""About 40 percent of the U.K's exports go to the euro area, and a large percentage of U.K. banks have claims on the euro area, so there's a lot of linkages,"" she says. So when Europe has a problem - or feels the sting of credit-rating cuts - so does Britain.Patterson wants to sell the pound against the dollar at 1.5295 with a stop at 1.5530 and a target of 1.4800.Todd Gordon, co-head of research and trading at Aspen Trading Group, says he thinks the trade is ""right on,"" noting that the pound and the dollar have just broken out of a three-year trading range.

3230,Cramer's 5 Rules For Becoming a Better Investor,Mad Money,13-01-2012,"Avoid some of the most common and money-losing mistakes that investors make, Cramer said Friday, by following five rules to help you make money in any environment.""If you follow my rules, you should be able to recognize an opportunity when you see it and to manage to avoid losing money when you don't have to, no matter what the circumstances, including a collapse in Europe or a slowing in China or even a skyrocketing oil price,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.Rule #1: ""Don't dig in your heels when you're wrong""The late, great economist John Maynard Keynes always said, ""When the facts change, I change my mind."" Cramer has adopted the quote as his personal mantra. After all, he said one of the easiest mistakes to make is refusing to change your mind when the facts are in and you've been proven wrong. It's one of the most difficult things for the most emotional investors and traders to do, but also crucial to be a good investor.""Swallowing your pride is never easy, but the more time you spend digging in your heels, the less you have to take advantage of the new situation and profit from it,"" Cramer explained.Rule #2: ""Price matters""Price is so important, that if it could go low enough, investors are willing to buy stocks of companies they don't even like that much. Cramer will never recommend a stock when he thinks the fundamentals of the underlying company are deteriorating and normally there's a lot of space between a ""best of breed"" company and one that's uninvestable. In normal circumstances then, if a lowly company's stock falls to a certain level that makes it just too darned cheap to pass up, Cramer thinks it's perfectly OK to buy when you merely have a low opinion of the underlying company. That's when price matters.So how do you know when the price is right for a stock you wouldn't otherwise buy? It's a sliding scale, Cramer said, where the better the company, the more you should be willing to pay. If speculating, he recommends looking for companies that have been left for dead, even though they still have pulse upon closer inspection. Just be sure that bankruptcy is not on the table, he added. So long as bankruptcy is not on the radar, then buying an unattractive company at an attractive price could make a lot of sense.Rule #3: ""Don't take your cue from an inferior company""When a ""worst of breed"" name says things are bad for the entire sector, don't just take it on faith, Cramer said. Weak players always seek to pin their failings on the entire industry, he explained. It's important, then, that investors are able to recognize the excuses. If a company has gotten into the habit of serial underperformance and blames its shoddy results on a shoddy environment, Cramer said the odds are that its competitors will tell a different story. At the same time, bad news for one company might not mean bad news for another company in the same sector. Investors can't just assume that all companies in the same industry are equivalent, he noted.Rule #4: ""Don't believe the hype""Not all upside surprises are worth getting excited about, Cramer said. If a company reports quarterly results that show its earnings-per-share are higher than what the average analyst on Wall Street had expected, then all of the headlines will describe it as an upside surprise.""Stocks are supposed to go up when the underlying companies they're attached to deliver higher earnings than anyone had expected,"" Cramer explained. ""But what the headlines call an upside surprise and what truly impresses the professionals in a quarter are two different things.""Headline writers don't draw a distinction between a high quality upside surprise and a ""low quality, illusory"" upside surprise, Cramer noted. Investors can tell the difference, though. A high-quality upside surprise is generated by high-than-expected sales, which leads to better-than-expected earnings per share. Improved sales means the industry is improving and more people are buying the company's products or it could mean that the company is taking market share. Either way, it bodes well for the company.On the other than, a low-quality upside surprise is based purely on a better bottom line (earnings per share) than the top line (the sales number). In this case, the upside surprise is not generated by improved business, but because management cut costs, changed their accounting practices or bought back shares. None of these things matter to Wall Street analysts, though. Instead, they want to see a company's ability to deliver better-than-expected sales.Rule #5: ""Be critical of commentary""One of the most natural and misleading mistakes, Cramer said, is to assume that people on TV criticizing the market must be telling the truth. Don't fall victim to this. People who dislike the market are not any more honest or less self-interested than those who talk up the market and/or individual stocks. Investors should be just as skeptical of bears as they are of bulls. But to most people, expressing a critical view of the market and/or an individual stock automatically bolsters the commentators credibility. But Cramer said the people criticizing the market in the media aren't necessarily trying to help you. When people see a commentator recommending a stock, they automatically assume that person owns it and is promoting it for those reasons. But nobody thinks the commentator criticizing the market is just trying to knock stocks down in order to buy them at a lower price.The rule of thumb is to always be on your guard and think critically of what you hear the commentators say on TV or read in print, Cramer said. After all, the bearish commentators aren't any more altruistic or honest than the bullish ones.Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

3244,Indonesia Looks to Grow Its Economy 'Creatively',Asia-Pacific News,15-01-2012,"Indonesia is digging into thousands of years of rich, creative culture and history to push itself forward faster into the 21st century. And it's not looking at basket weaving, batik or busloads of mass-market tourists. ""It's about ideas and new ones,"" says Mari Pangestu, in charge of Indonesia's new Ministry for Tourism and Creative Economy, set up just three months ago.Pangestu told CNBC that creative economy includes everything from restaurants, fashion, music, theatre, industrial design, publishing, spa, and arts and crafts. According to her this kind of activity already accounts for about 7 percent of Indonesia's economy.She wants to boost that share by more than half, to over 11 percent of GDP, over the next decade or so. That would be worth what agriculture is now to Indonesia's still largely oil and commodity based economy. Pangestu plans to do it by creating an ecosystem that supports start-ups. ""We want to tap what is inherently a creative culture for ideas, commercialize them, and scale them up,"" says Pangestu, who was Trade Minister before this new portfolio, which she juggles together with tourism.She points to the success South Korea has had in digital entertainment and pop culture, both of which have become huge exports.In Indonesia, she sees clusters of creative economic activity already brewing in places like Bandung, and Bali, and wants to create the same kind of buzz in other Indonesian cities. Indonesia watchers say it helps that Pangestu is also looking after small and medium sized companies, until President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono appoints a new minister for that portfolio.""We're not reinventing the wheel,"" says one of Indonesia's most well known economists. ""But what we will have to do is balance the role of government as a catalyst for creative enterprises, and entrepreneurial risk-taking and drive.""Pangestu is lobbying with her country's central bank, Bank Indonesia, as well as with leading commercial banks in the archipelago to get them to support her ideas. She admits it won't be easy, but says she's trying to convince them through potential banking riches at the ""bottom of the pyramid""\xc2\xa0 - the poorest socio-economic group. At the same time, Pangestu is also sounding out potential venture capitalists, in Indonesia, as well as abroad""(For) Agriculture, you need land. Industry, you need to build factories. With the creative economy, it's about the people, and maintaining what you already have there, your very rich culture, heritage and tradition, how do you preserve it, and at the same time grow it?"" says Pangestu.If creative start-ups boom, they could also give the country's image a big boost internationally. And, while the tourism part of her portfolio involves policy-making to pull more travelers into Indonesia (predominantly mass-market tour groups or volume business), she wants creative economic activity to bring higher margins. ""We need to layer on a premium for specifically Indonesian ideas and value-additions,"" she says.She had a series of meetings recently with senior Chinese officials, who told her that China was also planning to throw its weight behind creative economic activity. But she is not worried because China has been able to dominate industrial activity globally by producing goods cheaper than anybody else. Indonesia, she says, is aiming for the higher end of the market.Pangestu is confident that Indonesia will be able to grow in this area because \xe2\x80\x9cIndonesia has a long and deep history of creative activity. Creativity is in our DNA.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2012/01/15/indonesia-looks-to-grow-its-economy-creatively.html

3265,CEO Blog: Network Mobility \xe2\x80\x93 It\xe2\x80\x99s More Than Wireless ,The Guest Blog,17-01-2012,"In 2012, the term \xe2\x80\x9cmobility\xe2\x80\x9d has become more than a pure wireless connection for consumers \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s a gateway to access popular services, personal media and the cloud anytime, anywhere. Behind this mobile curtain lies an intelligent network that enables services to follow subscribers from location to location, and affect how they access their content. This has powerful implications to the world of computing as we know it. In today\xe2\x80\x99s world, people are no longer tethered to a stationary PC, as witnessed by the \xe2\x80\x9cbring your own device\xe2\x80\x9d (BYOD) phenomena. In the last few years, smartphones and tablets have transformed from social and entertainment \xe2\x80\x9ctoys\xe2\x80\x9d to business productivity tools. In fact, Forrester Research found that by 2015, 1 in 3 US online consumers will use a tablet, and more often than not they will be bringing these devices into the workplace. No one can question the tablet\xe2\x80\x99s ability to better enable business users to access, collaborate and share information in real time, whether they are at home, at work or on vacation. In addition to productivity gains, the proliferation of mobile devices has led to the creation of a new mobile ecosystem comprised of users, devices, operating systems, clients, applications, and the network itself, which gets increasingly harder for IT to manage. This new world of mobile computing is causing many enterprises to rethink their network strategies as companies no longer dictate the device, even though they still control the environment in which that device operates. This shift has already greatly changed the shape of network traffic, and it is presenting an entirely new set of challenges and expectations on the network in terms of access, performance, and security. What is needed from the network? The network has to get smarter so it can distinguish users and what devices they\xe2\x80\x99re using. It has to know where they roam and give specific levels of access \xe2\x80\x94 through role-based authentication \xe2\x80\x94 because enterprises have to keep out unauthorized users. The network has to keep track of everything in motion. ",https://www.cnbc.com/2012/01/17/ceo-blog-network-mobility-its-more-than-wireless.html

3301,Employee Review Time: Three Ways to Give Tough Feedback,Executive Careers Blog,17-01-2012,"Right now, one of your employees\xe2\x80\x94let's call him Bob\xe2\x80\x94has spinach between his teeth, metaphorically speaking. Someone needs to tell him. Here are three possible problems, plus three extra-strength techniques: 1) Bob can't hear the feedback. You think you're talking about a little piece of spinach, but Bob thinks his entire identity is under attack and gets defensive. Use the evil twin technique. Say: ""Bob, this (the performance issue) is so UNLIKE YOU. What happened?"" That allows Bob to preserve self-esteem, while he agrees with you that the problem was an outlier and won't happen again. Unfortunately, sometimes you can't blame the evil twin because Bob's behavior is EXACTLY like BOB. But you can still make the feedback easier to hear. Say: ""Bob, unless we fix this, it's going to derail your career. You're much too important to the organization, and to me, for us to let that happen."" 2) Bob doesn't understand it. Your feedback is unclear\xe2\x80\x94probably because it's too general. Use the video camera technique. Be specific. Stick to what Bob did or didn't do, said or didn't say\xe2\x80\x94concrete behavior that, if you made a movie about Bob, anyone in their right mind would observe it. Bad: ""You were unprofessional at the client meeting."" (There are 1001 ways to be unprofessional. ""Unprofessional"" is an interpretation, not observable behavior.) Still bad: ""You seemed highly agitated."" (You can't see agitation.) Better: ""I noticed you gulped down 10 pills the size of horse tranquilizers. Then you galloped out of the meeting. Later, I heard some whinnying."" 3) Bob doesn't know what to do about it. The whole purpose of feedback is to influence the future. The past is dead. If you only talk about the past, that's criticism. Criticism sounds bad: ""Bob, you screwed this up, you screwed that up, you screwed everything up. You're a screw-up!"" That's a tough message to motivate with. Use future-focused feedback. Be the coach who pulls a player off the field, whispers a few words of advice and encouragement, then sends him back out. Say these three key words: ""The next time . . .

Market volatility can make any investor question his strategy, sometimes prompting knee-jerk reactions to events and short-term trends.At this point, there's little reason to think that 2012 will be a smooth ride.To help set the table, we've culled somepredictionsabout the from CNBC anchors, editors and reporters. EquitiesThe U.S. stock market has a rip-your-face-off rally. Sometime next year, the stock market will experience a huge rally that will make suckers of all the pessimists like me. Shorts will get clobbered; those sitting on the sidelines will look foolish. \xe2\x80\x94 John CarneyEquities gain but stock-picking rules.With the Fed on hold, and the economy chugging along at slow speed, stocks can still go higher. Strategists see just marginal gains in 2012. It should prove better to be a stock-picker than to just rely on those returns from sectors and indices. \xe2\x80\x94 Patti DommHard times for ETFs and Chinese stocks.As market volatility continues, expect regulators and politicians to seek a scapegoat. The most likely target, because it has the least lobbying power: Leveraged ETFs. And accounting issues continue to hamper Chinese stocks that trade in the U.S. But with their stock values already pummeled, nobody cares.  \xe2\x80\x94 Herb GreenbergThe U.S. stock market will continue to outperform Europe and the rest of the world. U.S. economic data in the fourth quarter is already outpacing Europe and will continue to do so at least into the first half of 2012. \xe2\x80\x94  Bob PisaniU.S. stocks will rise 5 to 8 percent.Sure, we have problems, but the rest of the developed world has bigger issues and capital will continue to flow to, as one of my sources calls it, \xe2\x80\x9cthe least dirty shirt in the laundry.\xe2\x80\x9d It won\xe2\x80\x99t be a boom year for stocks, but continued solid earnings and expectations for a change in the White House should push equities higher. (Last year, I predicted the Dow Industrials would rise 8 to 10 percent and it's still possible.) \xe2\x80\x94 Brian SullivanChinese stocks will outperform. With the property market offering deadbeat returns and interest rates remaining low (as the government tries to ease the pain of a housing correction), investors will finally return to stocks. After a three-year slump, Chinese equities will rally as investors realize the virtue of buying into a market currently trading at just 11 times earnings. \xe2\x80\x94 Deepanshu BagcheeGoldPricesGold will exceed $2000 because the European Central Bank will have to print euros to bail out so many countries and banks, and that will raise the value of gold as a version of the world\xe2\x80\x99s reserve currency. Gold will be a terrific performer once again. Mad Money\xe2\x80\x99s been bullish on gold since we started and we remain bullish. \xe2\x80\x94 Jim Cramer I think gold has basically peaked and is now a bit overvalued. My prediction is that people will buy more stocks than gold. I\xe2\x80\x99m optimistic about the stock market, so I would not be a gold buyer. \xe2\x80\x94 Larry KudlowIf I had to put my own money on the line, I would probably bet gold does break $2,000. The fact is there\xe2\x80\x99s so much economic and political uncertainty in the world that people want safe havens. \xe2\x80\x94 Maria BartiromoThe long-term bull market in gold marches on. Goldwon\xe2\x80\x99t make a straight shot to a new inflation-adjusted high. Expect bullion prices to experience some pullbacks when the U.S. dollar is strengthening. The Federal Reserve has said it plans to leave interest rates near zero until the middle of 2013. As long as the real return on U.S. bondsis negative and other countries debase their own currencies, investors will turn to gold as an alternative currency and another form of protection against ongoing debt problems in developed and emerging nations. \xe2\x80\x94 Sharon Epperson A stronger dollar will devalue everyone\xe2\x80\x99s favorite speculative metal. Buying by emerging market central banks has propped up gold prices more than I thought possible, but cash and capital have better uses than a non-industrial metal, so I continue to expect a dumping of gold in 2012. That, and a stronger U.S. dollar, should drive the price down. Ignore the doomsday commercials. If indeed the Mayans are right, holding a heavy block of yellow metal won\xe2\x80\x99t matter much anyway. Invest instead in a bunker and canned foods. \xe2\x80\x94 Brian Sullivan Fixed Income The yield on the 10-year Treasury hits 1 percent. The secular move into bonds, coupled with easy money around the world, will continue to push bond yields to historic lows. \xe2\x80\x94 Gary Kaminsky Japan's placid bond market will slowly awaken from a deep, deflation-induced slumber. With 95 percent of Japan's government bonds owned by domestic investors, the government has been able to pay just 1 percent on 10-year bonds, despite running a debt-to-GDP ratio of 200 percent. That will change in 2012, as politicians fail to bring the deficit under control and ratings agencies take further action. As domestic savings find other channels, bond investors will wise up and hedge funds will see an opportunity. Still, the rise in yields won't trigger a crisis, given Japan's large current account surplus and large pool of domestic savings. But Japan's government will finally realize its finances are running on borrowed time. \xe2\x80\x94 Deepanshu Bagchee ",https://www.cnbc.com/2012/01/18/what-to-expect-from-the-financial-markets-in-2012.html

3320,Bank of America's Fourth Quarter Can't Go Well (and Won't),CNBC Stock Blog,18-01-2012,"How else to describe Bank of America , which has stumbled so often since the 2008 crisis it is difficult to imagine the bank doing anything right? Even if it did, investors would probably just chalk it up to dumb luck, and sell the stock anyway.The current banking environment is not for amateurs. Political and regulatory minefields lurk around every corner. Europe is on the verge of the collapse. The U.S. is paralyzed by recessionand the short-term thinking of its political and business leaders, who only want to dress up ugly numbers to win the next election or cash in their stock options at the earliest opportunity.Nowhere are these ills more evident than in the performance of giant multinational financial institutions.Even supposedly well-run companies like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs are having a tough time of late.JPMorgan  posted horrible trading results in the fourth quarter as well as a decline in mortgage revenues when it reported its results on Friday.Goldman , which reported earnings ahead of Wednesday's open, has seen some high-level defections as it struggles to find its footing amid widespread public criticism and the threat of harsh new rules aimed at type of trading that for years formed the heart of its profit machine.Wells Fargo has bucked the trend, turning in solid results again in the fourth quarter and showing strength in mortgage origination and even capital markets.But Bank of America is no Wells Fargo. It has been too busy looking for businesses to sell to meet tough new capital rules.Bank of America is in no position to scoop up talented investment bankers on the cheap, as Wells did in hiring several executives from Chicago-based investment firm Citadel last year, or to buy a distressed European lending business as Wells did recently in acquiring from Burdale Capital Finance from the Bank of Ireland .With both Citigroup and JPMorgan posting poor fourth-quarter trading results, it is hard to imagine how Bank of America could do much better.Even if it did, investors would probably view the feat as an unsustainable one-time event.No one is looking for Bank of America to turn into a trading powerhouse \xe2\x80\x94 if such an animal can even be said to exist anymore given how severely new regulations (or merely the threat of them) have clipped the wings of Wall Street traders.What analysts and investors are hoping to see from Bank of America is evidence that it is putting mortgage litigation risk behind it.But how can the bank possibly provide such evidence? Don't expect positive news from negotiations between Bank of America and government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac .Not when the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees the mortgage giants, is under criticism from its inspector general for failing to challenge a $1.35 billion settlement between Bank of America and Freddie Mac over mortgage repurchase clams.Some analysts are hoping for finalization of a long ago-proposed $25 billion deal regarding mortgage servicing abuses between the banks and attorney generals from a majority of the 50 states in the U.S. Still, a big settlement is hard to envision when attorneys general from several states, including New York, Massachusetts and Delaware, refuse to go along with a deal.""We look forward to doing whatever it takes to obtain servicing reforms \xe2\x80\x94 whether through a negotiated deal with banks or through regulations issued by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But we will not release claims that we are currently investigating,"" wrote New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and his Delaware counterpart Beau Biden in an essay for Politico.In addition to mortgage servicing, Schneiderman and Biden are investigating securitization, origination and ""the Frankenstein's monster of a recording system called the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems,"" they wrote.JPMorgan, which has far fewer problems than Bank of America, saw its mortgage-related legal costs rise during the quarter, casting an ominous cloud over Bank of America's coming report.Some analysts are hoping for resolution of Bank of America's proposed $8.5 billion settlement of mortgage litigation involving Bank of America, Goldman, BlackRock Financial , Pimco and other large institutional money managers.But with Schneiderman, the FDIC and others arguing against the proposed settlement, it is hard to imagine the deal will go through as proposed.If it proves more costly, analysts will have to revise upward their projections for Bank of America's mortgage losses. Most of those projections still use that far-from-done $8.5 billion deal as a benchmark.Bank of America's share price may easily finish 2012 above the $6.48 level where it closed on Tuesday, assuming Europe doesn't come apart in the meantime.Still, anyone who believes the bank's troubles are in the rear-view mirror is likely to be in for a nasty surprise.Additional News: FDIC Requires Big Banks to Have Breakup PlanAdditional Views: Option Bulls Won't Quit Bank of America______________________________\xc2\xa0 CNBC Data Pages:Dow 30 Stocks\xe2\x80\x94In Real Time Oil, Gold, Natural Gas Prices Now Where's the US Dollar Today?______________________________ Disclosures:TheStreet's editorial policy prohibits staff editors, reporters and analysts from holding positions in any individual stocks.Disclaimer",https://www.cnbc.com/2012/01/18/bank-of-americas-fourth-quarter-cant-go-well-and-wont.html

Investors watching for any signs of Swiss National Bank intervention were initially suspicious, but it soon became clear that the Swiss were not the euro buyers, and things settled down. Strategists like Amelia Bourdeau, a director in the foreign exchange group at Westpac, said indications pointed to a ""fat finger"" - someone entering the wrong data on a trade.Still, the Swissie has other factors weighing on it, says Mark McCormick, a currency strategist with Brown Brothers Harriman.

3325,Farr: Buy The Banks? ,The Guest Blog,18-01-2012,"Bank stock prices have increased significantly over the past couple of months. In fact, the financials sector of the S&P 500 has been up more than any other sector since November 23, which was roughly the beginning of the current market rally. Specifically, Financials have risen over 18% compared to an increase of slightly more than 12% for the entire S&P 500 . Similarly, the KBW Bank Index , which is a narrower index of the Financials universe consisting of 24 major US banks, is up nearly 24% over that same time frame - double the increase of the S&P 500. Is this strength in the banking sector justified? What is driving the strength and will it continue? The primary driver of the recent strength, in our estimation, is valuation. Bank stocks had so under-performed the broader market since the Great Recession began that it may have just been time for somewhat of a reversal. To put some numbers around the point, consider the following: the Financials sector of the S&P 500 fell over 55% from the beginning of 2008 through the end of 2011. Over this same time frame the S&P 500 was down just over 14%. Bank stocks went from trading at a 2x or 3x (or more!) multiples to book values to discounts to book values, in most cases. Over the course of this revaluation process, expectations for bank returns were scaled back dramatically - and perhaps too dramatically. Bank stocks that had once been expected to generate returns well in excess of their cost of capital were suddenly not expected to ever earn their cost of capital again. And any company that is not able to earn its cost of capital won't survive for very long. More recently, however, bank stock investors have come to believe that they may have gotten too pessimistic with regard to future return expectations.To be sure, there is little chance that the Goldman Sachs' of the world will ever go back to earning 25%+ returns-on-equity on a consistent basis. However, banks that are able to put up low teens ROE's over a cycle most certainly deserve to trade at a premium to book value. We think investors are beginning to get comfortable with the fact that banks, by and large, should be able to achieve these more modest targets in the future. A second reason for the recent strength in bank stocks is improved fundamentals and earnings visibility. Without question, the entire sector has been held back by a slew of uncertainties ranging from housing price declines to loan growth issues to regulatory changes. Ever so gradually, we are gaining more clarity with regard to these issues. Consider the following: Housing price declines, while not over, have leveled off, and the promise of election-year initiatives should provide support in the event of further price declines; The effect of many new government regulations, including Regulation E, the Card Act, and the Durbin Amendment are now well understood and quantifiable with regard to their effect on bank revenue and earnings; New capital requirements, as determined by various stress tests and Basel 3, have mostly been defined at this point; Improvements in credit loss and delinquency trends are now well established; Loan growth has turned positive; Bank balance sheets, following recapitalization and asset sales, are much stronger than prior to the crisis; Deposits continue to pour in, promising strong earnings potential as loan growth improves and interest rates rise; Many banks have gone a long way toward right-sizing their expense bases, including employment levels. But while much has been clarified, uncertainties undoubtedly remain. For instance, the backlog of home foreclosures remains large, the ultimate level of mortgage ""put-backs"" is unknown, low interests rates continue to drag down margins, the capital markets businesses may be in secular rather than cyclical decline, the Volcker Rule has yet to be defined, unemployment remains high, etc, etc. These are legitimate concerns that will definitely affect the earnings power at banks. As long as uncertainties such as these remain, valuations will be penalized. However, as issues get cleared up, one by one, investor reticence with regard to bank stocks should continue to decline. We once again quote Joe Rosenberg, Chief Investment Strategist at Loew's: ""You can have cheap equity prices or good news, but you can't have both at the same time."" In other words, it will be too late if we wait for all the risks and uncertainties to clear up. Bank stock valuations will have already risen to reflect the improved outlook. So, in a nutshell, the rally in bank stocks we are seeing is due to a combination of super-cheap valuations and the alleviation of some of the uncertainties that had been weighing down the sector. As long as the visibility surrounding future bank earnings power continues to improve, we would expect valuations to improve and bank stocks to continue to perform well relative to the overall market. After the recent increase in prices, earnings disappointments or other bits of adverse news will likely cause setbacks. Those strike us as near term issues which may add to volatility but should not derail clear, albeit plodding, long-term progress. Michael K.

3330,"Shanghai Rally to Face Resistance at 2,300: Charts",Charting Asia,17-01-2012,"Is the current rally the beginning of a new uptrend for the Shanghai Index? This was one of the key questions I was asked when I was in Beijing earlier this week.The answer can be got from chart activity on the Shanghai Index and from the broader thrust of government policy related to the slowing of the economy and to the battle against inflation.There are five key features in the behavior of the Shanghai Index . These features provide the environment for the development of a downtrend breakout for the Index. The features are:The support activity created by trend line AThe resistance activity created by trend line BThe historical support/resistance feature near 2,300. The historical support near 2,000.The wide separation in the Guppy Multiple Moving Averages.Trend line A acted as a resistance level until October 26, 2011. The breakout above the value of trend line A signaled the start of the 2011 rally from October to November. Now trend line A acts as a support level.Trend line B is the long-term downtrend line and it acts as a resistance level. A breakout above the value of this downtrend line is very bullish. Current value is near 2,340.The current rally is testing the support/resistance level near 2,300. A move above this level is bullish. A retreat away from this level is bearish and confirms the downtrend remains very strong.The market may develop a consolidation band between 2,000 and 2,300.\xc2\xa0 Activity inside this trading band could contain high volatility with very fast rallies and very fast retreats. This is the danger in the current market with the potential for a rapid retreat from resistance near 2,300 and a retest of support near 2,000 to 2,150.The long-term GMMA shows investors thinking and this remains well separated. This suggests investors are sellers in this market and their selling created the retreat from the 2,300 resistance level. The most important behavior is compression in the long-term GMMA because this shows investors are becoming buyers. This is a bullish behavior and confirms the development of a new uptrend.Market rebounds develop in four main types of patterns. They are: L-shaped consolidation. The strong rally towards 2,300 suggests this L-shaped consolidation pattern will not develop.Saucer pattern. This pattern may develop so traders watch for the behavior of any retreat from 2,300.V-shaped recovery. Looks like this pattern will not develop because the rally is moving too quickly.Inverted head and shoulder pattern. The fast rally has changed the potential development of this pattern. A move above 2,300 and a retreat from the value of trend line B creates the conditions for an inverted head and shoulder pattern. Traders watch for the future development of the index behavior.The strong resistance features near 2,300 and the value of trend line B suggest the Shanghai Index will retreat. A small retreat is bullish because it is easier to retest the resistance levels. A strong weekly close above trend line B near 2,340 is very bullish and will signal the start of a new uptrend. This remains a rally within the context of a downtrend, but it is also part of the context of a broad consolidation pattern.Daryl Guppy is a trader and author of Trend Trading, The 36 Strategies of the Chinese for Financial Traders \xe2\x80\x93.

3355,Johnson: Is a Healthy Lifestyle Part of Your Retirement Plan?,The Guest Blog,18-01-2012,"A cynic would suggest that many of those quixotic New Year\xe2\x80\x99s resolutions will ultimately go the way of bipartisan compromise in Washington \xe2\x80\x93 a great idea that never comes to pass. Smart investors should think otherwise. By all accounts, a renewed commitment to one\xe2\x80\x99s health is a sound financial decision.Healthcare costs are a key ingredient of everyone\xe2\x80\x99s financial plan, as a healthy couple at age 65 in 2018 will need $511,000for health care. Should either spouse develop a long-term illness, years of savings will evaporate into decades of struggle. The Consumer Price Index may be 3.4%, but the cost for healthcare is rising at a much faster pace. To illustrate the tremendous strain health care has on families, 20 percentof bankruptcies last year were the result of medical bills. And while it\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable to assume that insurance would prevent such demise, 75 percentof people pushed into bankruptcy because of medical costs already had insurance when they became ill. Moreover, the government is projected to run enormous budget deficits, as retired baby boomers and the most vulnerable amongst us will incur burdensome medical expenses in the not too distant future. Unfortunately, two-thirds of peopleover 65 will need long-term care during their lifetime and Medicare contributes virtually nothing for services provided. Weight is a function of calories consumed versus calories burned by the body and the excess is stored as fat. A regular exercise routine not only controls weight that may lead to costly medical procedures during retirement, but can also make workers more productive. Rumor has it that increased blood flow goes a long way to improve alertness and energy levels at work. As one takes stock of the current circumstance, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to conclude that a healthy lifestyle is akin to saving money for retirement. According to the CDC, the consequences of being overweight include coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, hypertension, stroke, liver disease and osteoarthritis. When you consider that consumer out-of-pocket health care expenses will reach an average of $3,301 a yearfor each household by 2014, staying fit might offer handsome returns. Of course, exercise is only part of the answer. Smoking accounts for 20 percentof all deaths each year in the United States, dramatically increasing the odds of heart disease, lung cancer and reparatory illnesses that dig deep holes in shallow nest eggs. Also, your bank account reflects what you eat. Few of us have the discipline to completely eliminate juicy cheeseburgers, rich pasta and fried food, but good eating habits should pay robust dividends during retirement. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that 80,000 new chemicals have been introduced since the turn of the 20th century, creating a heavy burden on the body. Author J.J. Smith explains in \xe2\x80\x9cLose Weight Without Dieting or Working Out\xe2\x80\x9d that five of the most toxic chemicals were found in 100 percent of tissue samples in an EPA study. Fortunately, a body that is properly nourished and detoxified will operate at peak performance. ",https://www.cnbc.com/2012/01/18/johnson-is-a-healthy-lifestyle-part-of-your-retirement-plan.html

Democrats pounced, gleeful at the prospect of portraying the leading Republican candidate as a direct beneficiary of tax policies that favor the wealthy over the middle class. They started a Twitter campaign to mock his reluctance to release his federal income tax returns. And they sent out more than a dozen e-mails citing his taxes. \xe2\x80\x9cHis tax plan would increase benefits for millionaires and billionaires,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eric Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York, on a conference call quickly organized by the Democratic National Committee. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to understand his refusal to disclose the loopholes he\xe2\x80\x99s using and the tax strategy he\xe2\x80\x99s employed.\xe2\x80\x9d And in case that was not enough, Mr. Romney offered some icing on the cake: an offhand remark that his income from paid speeches amounted to \xe2\x80\x9cnot very much\xe2\x80\x9d money. The problem? In one recent year, he made $374,327.62 giving speeches \xe2\x80\x94 an amount vastly higher than the income of a typical family. It was as if Mr. Romney was once again playing into the hands of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s political advisers, who believe that voters will not elect a wealthy, Wall Street Republican during a time of economic uncertainty. Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s comments came on the heels of more than two weeks of attention \xe2\x80\x94 driven largely by Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s Republican rivals \xe2\x80\x94 focused on his role as a venture capitalist who bought and sold businesses, with sometimes dire consequences for workers. And that followed Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s statement that he knows what its like to worry about getting a pink slip, and a comment, taken out of context by his critics, that he \xe2\x80\x9clikes to fire people.\xe2\x80\x9d Taken together, the string of moments provided Democrats an opportunity to define Mr. Romney as out of touch with regular people, a creature of special interests and the embodiment of Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the wealthy need to do more to help the nation get out of its fiscal hole.

3368,Germany Controls EU Debt Crisis: Cramer,Mad Money,17-01-2012,"Germany has taken control of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign debt crisis, Cramer noted Tuesday, adding German policymakers have essentially told troubled countries, \xe2\x80\x9cgive me austerity and I will give you growth.\xe2\x80\x9d In turn, the U.S. stock market was able to rally Tuesday despite downgrades of key countries over the weekend.German leaders are telling troubled nations that to get help, they must first get their house in order. That\xe2\x80\x99s how Spain\xe2\x80\x99s borrowing costs went down as Italy\xe2\x80\x99s were held in check. Both countries are implementing austerity programs that are hurting their growth, but neither will be cut loose like Greece. To Cramer, it seems Italy and Spain are willing to take a hit of a recession in order to appease the Germans. In turn, the Germans will help them get back on their feet without ever having to cut them a blank check.\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s been a recognition by the Germans that stock markets matter, that the banks matter, too, and if they can lift their banks and their stock markets, then they can put a stop to the heavy supply of regurgitated bonds that flooded the bond markets over and over again,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer observed. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce you clean out that supply by forcing the banks to be more creative and issue equity \xe2\x80\xa6 you defeat the bond vigilantes, who have pushed interest rates so high over in Europe.""Meanwhile, now that there is a dearth of supply, sovereign debt seems like a bargain as rates have fallen to a level that a financial institution could work a good arbitrage trade by taking virtually free money from the European Central Bank and buying sovereign bonds on the auctions, Cramer said. And since these bonds are all in euros, there\xe2\x80\x99s no currency risk, like when all European countries had their own form of currency.But how long can this last? Cramer suggests German Chancellor Angela Merkel will continue the bond-buying program for the foreseen future. He thinks she will continue to let euros roll off the printing presses to create growth after the trouble countries have embraced austerity because of the price action in gold. The precious metal has been making a comeback as people realize there is positive growth in Europe that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t involve austerity all together. In turn, he thinks gold could go to $2,000 an ounce over the next year and recommends buying the SPDR Gold Trust exchange-traded fund .Another positive sign for global growth is that the price of copper has had a major breakout. That\xe2\x80\x99s because the Chinese government is done letting its economy cool down. The People\xe2\x80\x99s Republic uses more than 30 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s copper, too. He recommends buying the iPath Dow Jones UBS Copper Tota ETF.\xe2\x80\x9cIf it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for the larger context of a return to Chinese growth plus European austerity as the path to German-fueled growth, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing over here,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow it does, hence why we can rally after the Friday night ratings massacre, why we can take our eyes off the euro for a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d",https://www.cnbc.com/2012/01/17/germany-controls-eu-debt-crisis-cramer.html

The \xe2\x80\x9cchatter\xe2\x80\x9d from Volkswagen suggests it could reach 15 million in 2012, even though analysts are expecting just 13.5 million in auto sales. Meanwhile, December auto sales figures showed sharp increases, including a 7 percent pop for cars, 9.6 percent gain for light trucks and a 28 percent increase in the number of small SUVs sold.Cramer thinks auto sales will be strong in 2012, but to play it, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t recommend buying automakers, like Ford Motor  or General Motors . Instead, he likes indirect plays and specifically, the companies that supply the automakers with components.Take Magna , for example. The company makes technologically advanced components, systems and modules, including anything from seating systems to powertrain systems. It is the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest auto parts supplier and is such a force in the industry that the big automakers can\xe2\x80\x99t push it around. In other words, it has strong pricing power.Magna\xe2\x80\x99s recent quarterly results weren\xe2\x80\x99t particularly impressive, but it has a sizable backlog, meaning business should be strong going forward. Its stock has run up 22 percent in the last 30 days and yet Cramer thinks it has room to run. He thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s a buy.Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

3408,7 Compensation Tactics To Help Retain Employees,Small Business,19-01-2012,"Guest columnist Ron Volper discusses how a well-thought out compensation plan can help retain your best employeees.Small and mid-sized businesses that lose top performers incur the costs of hiring and training new employees, but they face an even greater risk: damaging relationships with existing customers and eroding the morale of other employees. Proof of this is that the companies that are the most profitable usually have the highest employee retention. A study the Ron Volper Group conducted, in 2011, across a range of industries, confirmed that the number one reason for ""unforced turnover"" is employee dissatisfaction with their compensation. Moreover, 80 percent of employees who voluntarily left their company took a higher paying position with another company.

3427,"Regional Banks Get Loan Pleasure, Durbin Pain",CNBC Stock Blog,19-01-2012,"Huntington  reported fourth-quarter earnings applicable to common shareholders of $119.2 million, or 14 cents a share, declining from $135.7 million, or 16 cents a share, the previous quarter, but increasing from $39.1 million a year earlier, mainly from a decline in credit expenses. The Columbus, Ohio, lender's fourth-quarter results met the analyst consensus EPS estimate of 14 cents, according to Zacks. Huntington's earnings declined from the third quarter reflected an 11 percent decline in noninterest income, with electronic banking revenue declining 44 percent to $18.2 million as the Durbin Amendment's limitations to interchange fee revenue from debit card purchase transactions took effect. The decline in noninterest income also reflected $19.1 million in gains on the sale of loans in the third quarter, when Huntington securitized $1 billion in automobile loan, for a $15.5 million gain. Fourth-quarter gains on loan sales totaled $2.9 million. On Dec. 31, Huntington reclassified $1.3 billion of automobile loans to loans held for sale in anticipation of completing another securitization in the first half of 2012. Huntington CEO Stephen Steinour said the company would be doing auto loan securitizations ""once or twice a year,"" as part of its strategy to ""have a limited exposure, frankly, to everything,"" adding that auto loan securitization ""generates a significant return for us, and it comes with a very low cost of funding right now."" Partially offsetting the noninterest income decline in the fourth quarter was an increase in mortgage banking income to $24.1 million from $12.8 million in the third quarter, although it was still way down from $53.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Bottom-line results for the fourth quarter were boosted by a $45 million release of loan loss reserves. Huntington's net interest margin \xe2\x80\x94 the difference between a bank's average yield on loans and investments and its average cost for deposits and wholesale borrowings \xe2\x80\x94 expanded to 3.38 percent during the fourth quarter from 3.34 percent in the third quarter and 3.37 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010, which Stienour said reflected a ""continued focus on fundamentally changing our deposit mix and driving down the overall cost of funds."" The CEO added that Huntington's auto loan originations had expanded into Minnesota and Wisconsin. ""We have auto loan operations in 16 states, mostly contiguous, except for new England,"" Steinour said, ""and 2011 was a record year with $3.65 billion dollars in origination, and the quality of our origination is highly desired, which is why the execution is so good for us.""Steinour also said that ""commercial growth"" in core deposits ""is really the story for us in the fourth quarter. We have had 10 quarters in a row now of commercial loan growth, with our best quarter yet in the fourth quarter."" Average commercial and industrial loan balances grew 4 percent during the fourth quarter, to $14.2 billion, while average residential mortgages grew 5 percent to $5 billion, and home equity loans grew by 2 percent to $8.1 billion. Steinour said that in Huntington's market area, ""there is a large amount of manufacturing doing quite well with exports,"" and that the ""auto sector is very strong and has rebounded incredibly."" He added that ""our health-care lending business has become a specialty business, with good results in the fourth quarter."" Huntington continued to aggressively pursue deposit growth, with average noninterest bearing demand deposits growing by a very strong 23 percent in the third quarter, to $10.7 billion, while core certificates of deposit declined by 11 percent, to $6.8 billion. Total deposits grew by 3 percent to $43.6 billion. Steinour said, ""Our fundamental strategies are working and we get a setback like Durbin or the Fed flattening the yield curve, we just continue executing our strategy and our results will overcome the setback in a reasonably short period because of our strong growth."" Huntington said its return on average assets (ROA) for the fourth-quarter was 0.92 percent. The ROA has ranged between 0.91 percent and 1.11 percent over the past five quarters, according to SNL Financial. Out of 20 analysts covering Huntington Bancshares, seven rate the stock a buy, 11 have neutral ratings, and two analysts recommend selling. BB&T  reported fourth-quarter net income available to common shareholders of $391 million, or 55 cents a share, increasing from $366 million, or 52 cents a share in the third quarter, and $208 million, or 30 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 2010. Fourth-quarter noninterest income totaled $922 million, increasing from $690 million the previous quarter, but declining from $964 million a year earlier. The third-quarter results included $104 million in expenses related to Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. loss-sharing agreements, ""due primarily to improved performance from covered loans,"" and posted $39 million in securities losses that quarter. The company also booked $16 million in merger related expenses during the fourth quarter, ""due primarily to charges associated with management's expense optimization efforts and costs related to the BankAtlantic acquisition."" BB&T expects to complete its purchase of BankAtlantic Bancorp's  main thrift subsidiary by the end of the first quarter, paying a premium of $301 million to acquire 78 South Florida branches. During the fourth quarter, BB&T reported $46 million in expenses related to FDIC loss-share, and securities gains of $103 million. Checkcard fees declined sharply to $42 million, from $78 million the previous quarter, as the Durbin Amendment took its toll. Average loans held for investment \xe2\x80\x94 excluding loans covered by FDIC loss-sharing agreements \xe2\x80\x94 grew 2 percent during the fourth quarter, to $100.7 million. Average residential mortgage loans grew 7 percent to $20.1 billion, and commercial and industrial loans grew by 3 percent to 35.2 billion. BB&T's fourth-quarter net interest margin was a tax-adjusted 4.02 percent, declining from 4.09 percent the previous quarter and 4.04 percent a year earlier. Maintaining a net interest margin over 4 percent in the current environment is quite difficult for a diversified lender, and BB&T CEO Kelly King said the company ""had another strong quarter growing deposits and improving our deposit mix,"" as ""average deposits increased 24 percent on an annualized basis compared to the third quarter, and noninterest-bearing deposits and interest checking increased 31 percent and 10 percent, respectively."" King also said that BB&T ""made further progress on our strategy to reduce the cost of interest-bearing deposits. The cost this quarter was 0.56 percent compared with 0.65 percent last quarter."" Average noninterest bearing checking account balances increased 8 percent during the fourth quarter, to $25.2 billion, while total deposits were up 15 percent, to $121.9 billion. The company's fourth-quarter earnings included a $135 million release of loan loss reserves. BB&T reported a fourth-quarter ROA of 0.93 percent, for its highest return over the past five quarters. Out of 29 analysts covering BB&T, eight rate the shares a ""buy,"" 19 have ""neutral"" ratings, and two analysts recommend selling the shares. Like the two regional banks, Bank of America's  fourth-quarter earnings reflected a similar painful hit from the Durbin Amendment, which ""reduced revenue by $430 million,"" according to the company. Bank of America met earnings expectations with a 15-cent quarterly profit, including a $2.12 billion profit for the company's mortgage banking unit.

This follows another 20 percent-plus gain in Internet ad spending that brought the sector within $4 billion of surpassing newspapers and magazines last year, according to the firm.Leading the way is the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest search engine, Google , which Thursday evening reported a 25 percent jump in revenue for the fourth quarter. Google gets the bulk of its revenue from advertisements generated through search, but it is steadily increasing its share in the online display ad market.Google took a hit in Friday\xe2\x80\x99s trading as investors grew concerned that the company is paying more to keep those ad clicks coming. Still, the shares are up 20 percent over the last five years, compared to a 67 percent drop in shares of The New York Times over the same period.With this digital hand-off officially happening, the question emerges: is there a contrarian investment to be made on old media companies as they finally figure out their own digital strategy?After all, digital revenues for the newspaper industry will jump 11 percent to $3.7 billion this year, forecasts eMarketer.

3494,How Cramer Uses Earnings Reports,Mad Money,19-01-2012,"On Thursday, Cramer detailed how he uses a company\xe2\x80\x99s earnings report, a tactic he recommends all investors do.\xe2\x80\x9cI measure the stock\xe2\x80\x99s earnings growth and its quality of earnings growth against its cohort,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I figure out whether its cohort is worth owning or forgetting about.\xe2\x80\x9dAfter all, the sector is an important issue to consider when picking stocks. Historically, a stock\xe2\x80\x99s sector had accounted for 50 percent of its performance. Today, though, many people invest by using exchange-traded funds. In turn, the sector has superseded earnings at times.Take bank stocks, for example. Many investors trade the XLF , the ETF that encompasses many bank stocks. If a certain bank stock is apart of the XLF, but then people don\xe2\x80\x99t want to buy that ETF, then it really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what kind of earnings results the bank posted. The bank stocks will largely trade in tandem because they are being pulled up or down by the XLF. For this reason, Cramer has had to dismiss earnings per share gains when the cohort was radically out of favor. Instead, he tries to determine which stocks can break free and outperform the cohort. Sector analysis is key here and it requires doing a lot of homework.\xe2\x80\x9cNothing\xe2\x80\x99s worse than owning a bad stock, as defined by weak earnings, in a bad sector neighborhood. Nothing\xe2\x80\x99s better than owning a good stock in a great neighborhood,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if you do not measure the stock\xe2\x80\x99s earnings against the sector\xe2\x80\x99s growth and you do not determine first whether the sector is in favor versus out of favor than the earnings report, better than expected or not, just won\xe2\x80\x99t mean a thing.\xe2\x80\x9dCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

3503,Mitt\xe2\x80\x99s Attack on Crony Capitalism Tough Stuff \xe2\x80\x94 The Right Stuff,Money & Politics with Larry Kudlow,20-01-2012,"Let me build on Charles Krauthammer\xe2\x80\x99s great Friday column, \xe2\x80\x9cThe GOP\xe2\x80\x99s Suicide March.\xe2\x80\x9d Krauthammer argues that just as President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s class-warfare, soak-the-rich mantra started lagging in the polls, some Republicans on the campaign trail started making the case that Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s Bain Capital was involved in nothing more than vulture capitalism, looting companies, and destroying jobs. Keeping class envy alive.I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to name names, because everybody knows who these Republicans are. Instead, I want to go positive, and commend Mitt Romney himself. Romney did his best in the second South Carolina debate to fight for free-market capitalism and Adam Smith, and against the spread of Obama-style crony capitalism and class envy. During the Thursday night debate, Romney launched this: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to stop the spread of crony capitalism. [Obama] gives General Motors to the UAW. He takes $500 million and sticks it into Solyndra. He stacks the labor stooges on the NLRB so they can say no to Boeing and take care of their friends in the labor movement. . . . He has to bow to the most extreme members of the environmental movement. He turns down the Keystone pipeline, which would bring energy and jobs to America. \xe2\x80\x9cMy view is capitalism works. Free enterprise works. . . . There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong with profit, by the way. That profit went to pension funds, to charities. It went to a wide array of institutions. . . . And by the way, as enterprises become more profitable, they can hire more people. I\xe2\x80\x99m someone who believes in free enterprise. I think Adam Smith was right. And I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna stand and defend capitalism across this country, throughout this campaign. I know we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get hit hard from President Obama, but we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna stuff it down his throat and point out that it is capitalism and freedom that makes America strong.\xe2\x80\x9d Whoa. Tough stuff. The right stuff. I watched this on DVR late at night. So just to be sure, I read the transcript the next morning. Still there. And let me say, this is exactly what the Republicans must say. The issue of crony capitalism should be front and center in this campaign. President Obama defends his cronies instead of the so called 99 percent. That\xe2\x80\x99s his contradiction. Big Labor, Big Business, and Big Green Energy are collections of cronies with big jobs, big salaries, and big privileges. Nothing to do with the 99 percent. But Governor Romney can go even further to slam crony capitalism. This is where tax-reform and deep spending cuts come in. A flattening of tax rates should be accompanied by the elimination of cronied tax deductions, exemptions, and carve-outs. Even more, we should get rid of crony corporate welfare wherever it exists, including crony government subsidies to energy, exports, and agriculture. Wherever it exists.

3509,Cavoli: How to Create that Super Bowl Ad Buzz,The Guest Blog,20-01-2012,"Why do companies buy the most expensive ads on earth during the Super Bowl? The answer is simple, it's word of mouth. Ads last less than a minute, but getting people talking can keep your brand in the conversation for a long time. But you have to have a plan. You are investing way too much in an ad just hope it stands out above Clydesdales, explosive movie trailers and shock and awe from companies like GoDaddy. So if you are a Super Bowl advertiser, how do you ensure people talk about you? 1. Focus on the Conversation People use Facebook to get involved in conversation. It may be easy to get people to visit your page and comment on the ad, but that type of conversation isn\xe2\x80\x99t meaningful and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t last long. Jokes about the actor in the ad may be funny for a couple days but they do nothing to convince others to buy your product. Prepare for your ad by encouraging customers to talk about your product on Facebook and across the social web. When your ad drives people to the web, they will find posts from peers that will get them interested about trying your product. You need to drive sales and you aren\xe2\x80\x99t spending $3 million in 30 seconds to get people to make cracks about the actor in your ad are you? 2. Cultivate Your Advocates There is a big difference between all your followers and your true brand advocates. How you cultivate those advocates can be the difference that makes your campaign grow in social media. Advocates are influential and they want to share meaningful experiences with your brand. Give them exclusive access to something of value to share with their followers. Things like product trials, unpublished content and special offers will generate the quality word of mouth that turns buzzing into buying. 3. Start NowQuality conversation takes a little time to build momentum, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of time. The social measurement firm Cymfony conducted a study on the media coverage and social media discussions surrounding Super Bowl advertisers a couple years ago. (Disclosure: I was at Cymfony working on this project at the time) The study found that most of the discussion companies receive about their Super Bowl ad occurs before the game. Staying quiet now and relying on massive word of mouth after the game isn\xe2\x80\x99t a good idea. Conversation and media coverage increases throughout January, it spikes the day after the game, and it drops off quickly over the next three days. By Thursday, the only ads with any discussion are the ones that had created some controversy that the company had to apologize for. Your window for creating valuable buzz is opening right now. Use every social media channel available to get people talking about your product. An Opportunity for Everyone Else Even if you are not advertising in the Super Bowl, you can still benefit from the Facebook gold rush. Get there first. If all these ads are going to be promoting Facebook on February 5th, there will be a lot of people logging on to the site that night and the next day. If their friends are already talking about your company and sharing their experiences here, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be part of the conversation. Your brand may get more exposure in social media than it ever could in a single day. You have to start now.

It\xe2\x80\x99s a name you must and should want to be in.\xe2\x80\x9dDocJ thinks Google is attractive on the sharp sell-off. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a broken company. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a buy on dips. Certainly I like Google a lot more today ($60 lower) than yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d JJ Kinhan agrees. \xe2\x80\x9cGoogle had a huge run. The sell-off takes the stock back to levels at which it was trading in the beginning in December,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s being oversold to the downside.\xe2\x80\x9dBut rather than buy the stock outright he thinks an options trade makes more sense, to limit downside. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d sell the 570 puts \xe2\x80\x93 collect the premium and protect against another wave of selling.\xe2\x80\x9d (It\xe2\x80\x99s important to note, by selling 570 puts Kinahan would be compelled to buy Google at $570 \xe2\x80\x93 a level he finds attractive.)If you want to play Google, Steve Grasso says wait. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather buy Google above $600 on momentum rather than as a value these levels.\xe2\x80\x9dLooking at Microsoft, trader JJ Kinhan thinks the action over the next few days could be very interesting and telling as Microsoft approaches $30, a level of past resistance. He says if it can get up and over, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at a technical break-out and there could be a lot more upside. However, $30 could again generate strong resistance and the stock could slide.\xe2\x80\x9dWhat do you think?

3526,Cohan: Corporations Need to Think Like a Start-Up,The Guest Blog,20-01-2012,"Entrepreneurs seem to win against the odds. Whether the story is about Bill Gates, Richard Bransonor any other legendary entrepreneur, that story usually ends with the word \xe2\x80\x9csuccess.\xe2\x80\x9d But how do the best entrepreneurs manage to succeed so often and so convincingly? Here are examples of how the entrepreneurial mind employs the following four principles of strategic decision-making: Exploiting confirmation bias. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever down-played information that you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear, you\xe2\x80\x99ve experienced confirmation bias. When he was a business pipsqueak in the early 1980s, Bill Gates exploited IBM\xe2\x80\x99s confirmation bias, cutting a deal that made him the world\xe2\x80\x99s richest man. IBM  was getting into the PC business and wanted to license a PC operating system. IBM believed that its marketing excellence would make it the PC leader overnight, and was happy to give Gates the license to sell his operating system to so-called PC clones. Since it assumed no clones would exist once it entered the market, IBM figured it was giving Gates something worthless. Gates thought otherwise, and as Dell  and Compaq took over the PC market, he got the better of IBM\xe2\x80\x99s confirmation bias. Letting a thousand flowers bloom. Google doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know where it\xe2\x80\x99s next big thing will sprout so it lets its people spend 25% of their time working on projects that interest them. The story of Google Earth suggests that unexpected outcomes can generate new revenues. Google co-founder Sergey Brin was testing US satellite-imaging software from Keyhole before acquiring the company in 2004. At a staff meeting, Brin put Keyhole on a projector and began to show people their houses. Brin soon asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy can\xe2\x80\x99t you look at the whole world at once?\xe2\x80\x9d By 2006, Google Earth had integrated advertisements \xe2\x80\x93 such as searching for pizza while visiting a neighborhood. And by requesting that users who download Google Earth also download a search toolbar, odds have increased that more people will click on an advertiser\xe2\x80\x99s ads, further boosting Google\xe2\x80\x99s top line. As of October 2011, Google Earth had been downloaded a billion times. Expanding through beachhead acquisitions. Although Cisco Systems  is a huge company, its growth during the 1990s came from a David-and-Goliath mindset that if it didn\xe2\x80\x99t grow, it would die. Cisco quickly recognized that acquisitions of small companies with a foothold in an emerging market could generate attractive returns, provided that the target made a product in a new category that corporate customers were eagerly purchasing; and it was to be weak in selling and marketing to large corporations \xe2\x80\x93 an activity at which Cisco excelled. This was the case with Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s 1993 acquisition of Crescendo Communications from which one of Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s largest customers, Boeing , intended to purchase switches. Cisco was concerned at the time that Crescendo\xe2\x80\x99s switches could cannibalize Cisco\xe2\x80\x99score technology, the router. But Cisco overcame this concern and acquired Crescendo for $95 million. It was a smart decision: by 1999 switches accounted for $4 billion in Cisco sales.

As avid \xe2\x80\x9cMad Money\xe2\x80\x9d viewers know, Cramer likes dividends because they pay a rate of return that certificate of deposits can\xe2\x80\x99t match. Of course, stocks present more risk than CDs, but they can also go a lot higher. Many companies increase their dividends year-over-year, too. When it comes to earnings, then, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to listen to whether management indicates if it will boost the dividend.\xe2\x80\x9cWe look for signals about the future on these calls, particularly about upcoming catalysts that will move the stocks later on, making them solid buys on any short term decline,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we try to measure confidence about cash flow that can ultimately trigger rising dividends, the best source of wealth that stocks can give us. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember, dividends pay us to wait for things to get better and there is no better way to find out about the prospects for increased dividends than to listen to the earnings calls.\xe2\x80\x9dCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

3542,Putting Earnings Reports In Context,Mad Money,19-01-2012,"It\xe2\x80\x99s important investors put a company\xe2\x80\x99s earnings report in context, Cramer said Thursday. The \xe2\x80\x9cMad Money\xe2\x80\x9d host detailed just how he interprets an earnings report.To start, Cramer looks at the predictive value for the year. If a company issues a report that beats the high man (the analyst who has the most aggressively high estimates on Wall Street), then that beat will cause a raising of numbers for the rest of the year.If a company does post such an increase in earnings per share, Cramer will try to figure out whether it actually stemmed from real business or had occurred as a result of accounting changes. To make that analysis, Cramer looks more at the revenues than the actual earnings themselves because a company can\xe2\x80\x99t change the sales line except by increasing demand, taking market share or by just plain better salesmanship. A company can, however, change the earnings by buying back a ton of stock. So the number of shares changes, but the profits stay the same. Investors should look at the accelerated revenue growth quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year because it tells you a lot about future revenue and earnings growth, helping you figure out how much to pay for a stock.\xe2\x80\x9cFigure out what that growth rate is using the revenue and earnings prism I have just given you, figure out how fast it is growing both linked quarter\xe2\x80\x94the previous quarter and the current one\xe2\x80\x94and year over year and then calculate that trajectory versus the growth rate,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf a company is growing at 20 percent and the price-to-earnings multiple, the stock price divided by the earnings per share, is 20 or less, you probably have a big bargain on your hands.\xe2\x80\x9dCramer refers to this concept as the price-to-earnings growth ratio. To him, it\xe2\x80\x99s much more important than the price-to-earnings multiple because it puts the multiple into context. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a rule of thumb I am willing to pay for a price to earnings multiple that may be up to twice the growth rate of the company, especially if there are very few companies growing that fast, meaning there is a scarcity value of fast growing companies,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. \xe2\x80\x9cHigher than that, paying 24 times earnings for a company that is growing at 40%, begins to get me nervous, even if 40 percent growth is very hard to come by.\xe2\x80\x9dCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

3543,Cramer's Earnings-Loaded 'Game Plan',Mad Money,20-01-2012,"What follows is Cramer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cGame Plan\xe2\x80\x9d for Monday, Jan. 23:MONDAY, JAN. 23Cramer plans to look for earnings results from Halliburton . The oil and gas company has disappointed many times before and unfortunately, Cramer expects more of the same. If it does disappoint, Cramer thinks the entire oil and gas space will go into a \xe2\x80\x9ctailspin.\xe2\x80\x9d The oil and gas industry is just too tethered to natural gas, he complained, adding the price of nat gas is way too low.Texas Instruments  will also report earnings on Monday. The Dallas-based company has become a favorite of analysts, who expect a new cycle in semiconductors. Cramer thinks the stock has run so much that it will almost have to disappoint. Ahead of its report, he recommends investors trim any non-Apple semiconductor suppliers.TUESDAY, JAN. 24DuPont  will deliver its earnings results on Tuesday. It has a lot of exposure to two sectors that struggled last year, but are thriving in 2012, namely housing and autos.Elsewhere in the market, personal care products maker Kimberly-Clark  and fast food restaurant chain operator McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s  are also scheduled to deliver earnings. Cramer thinks both stocks have run so much, they could sell-off, giving investors an opportunity to buy, buy, buy.After the bell, Apple will report earnings. To Cramer, it appears as though the technology company posted strong sales numbers over the holiday shopping season. In addition to its popular iPhone 4S device, the company has other new products and iterations on the way.Earlier this week, the stock hit its all-time high, but Cramer isn\xe2\x80\x99t sure that\xe2\x80\x99s necessarily a good thing. If Apple simply announces a very good quarter, it won\xe2\x80\x99t be enough. Then again, there are enough analysts with conservative numbers, so Cramer thinks Apple has some wiggle room.\xe2\x80\x9cI think the last month of Apple's quarter may have been the biggest ever. I get that from listening to the conference calls of Apple suppliers and realizing that Apple couldn't order enough parts to fulfill demand,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat's the best tell of a company's quarter I know of. I bet Apple will do the exact opposite of what Google did [recently] and blow away the numbers.\xe2\x80\x9dWEDNESDAY, JAN. 25\xe2\x80\x9cWe have two breaking up is easy to do plays and I own both for my charitable trust because I think we're going to start hearing plans about the break-ups and we will love them,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said of ConocoPhillips  and Abbott Labs . \xe2\x80\x9cBoth extremely undervalued companies where the parts are worth much more than the whole.\xe2\x80\x9dCramer is also looking forward to an earnings report from airline maker Boeing . He expects Boeing will shed light on new plane orders and how much money it\xe2\x80\x99s making from the older, established lines it\xe2\x80\x99s still producing en masse.Cramer\xe2\x80\x99s also going to look for quarterly results from Occidental , which he says is among the \xe2\x80\x9cmost aggressive and shareholder-friendly of any major oil companies.\xe2\x80\x9d He wants to hear about fracking operations in California. Most people forget that the Golden State has a massive amount of oil underneath it, he said. Occidental has the technology to get that oil out of the ground.The U.S. Federal Reserve will meet on Wednesday, too. Cramer thinks the Fed will have to acknowledge that there\xe2\x80\x99s more strength building than they originally thought given rising interest rates for long-term Treasurys.THURSDAY, JAN. 26Of the many companies reporting earnings on Thursday, Cramer plans to monitor 3M , Caterpillar and Nucor . 3M may be a hated stock, Cramer said, but the St. Paul, Minn.-based company will dispel the hatred. Cramer also thinks Caterpillar will tell a story about how the U.S. market is getting better. Nucor tends to be negative on the economy, but Cramer thinks this time could be different. CEO Dan DiMicco could actually say Nucor\xe2\x80\x99s orders for non-residential steel and auto steel are strong, he added.Starbucks will also report earnings, but Cramer\xe2\x80\x99s only hope is that the stock sells off, so investors can buy shares at discount.FRIDAY, JAN. 27When Honeywell International  reports earnings on Friday, Cramer thinks it will be very positive. If a down market takes HON with it, Cramer would buy shares.Cramer will also watch for earnings reports from Altria  and Procter & Gamble . There are whispers of an accelerated decline in smoking, Cramer said, which could negatively impact Altria. Procter & Gamble recently caught a downgrade because the analyst thought it was too expensive. \xe2\x80\x9cI'm on listen only mode for both, but they're tempting choices if they get hammered because we aren't done being hooked on smokes and Procter uses a ton of plastic, which is made from ultra-cheap natural gas.\xe2\x80\x9dWhen this story was published, Cramer\xe2\x80\x99s charitable trust owned Abbott Labs, Apple and ConocoPhillips.Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

3544,Cramer Bets on American Axle\xe2\x80\x99s Stock,Mad Money,20-01-2012,"The U.S. auto recovery will likely be one of the hottest trends in 2012, Cramer said Friday, adding American Axle & Manufacturing is a great way to play it.With a market cap of just $850 million, it is an $11 stock. To Cramer, it\xe2\x80\x99s the perfect pick for \xe2\x80\x9cSpeculative Friday.\xe2\x80\x9d He thinks it has terrific prospects.American Axle makes driveline and drivetrain systems, which are the components that transfer power from the transmission to the wheels, drive shafts and axles. It has a three year backlog of $1.1 billion worth of business, which is enough to produce double-digit annual revenue growth for some time. Plus, it has no real exposure to Europe. American Axle\xe2\x80\x99s stock has gained 14 percent since the beginning of the year, but has lost 23.7 percent over the last 12 months and is 63 percent off its 2007 highs. To Cramer, it\xe2\x80\x99s a bargain.It\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting, though, this is a speculative play because it has ultra high levels of customer concentration with General Motors accounting for roughly 70 percent of its revenues last year. Even as GM has been going gangbusters, Cramer thinks that\xe2\x80\x99s unhealthy. It\xe2\x80\x99s moving in the right direction and is currently quoting more than a billion dollars of new business opportunities, of which 90 percent are new customers. \xe2\x80\x9cTake some time, do the homework, then if you like what you see, I\xe2\x80\x99d start putting on a position before the company reports in two weeks,\xe2\x80\x9d Cramer said. \xe2\x80\x9cThen add more if the stock sells off, either on the quarter or a market-wide Europe-inspired pullback.\xe2\x80\x9dCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

3547,How to Trade the Greek Debt Talks,Money in Motion,20-01-2012,"The Greek drama continues to roil the euro, and this strategist has a way to play investors' shifting moods.The euro had a nice run this past week, thanks to positive news from the International Monetary Fund and investors' hopes that Greece and its bondholders would reach a deal. But whether the bullish mood will endure is another question. ""I think it's more likely than not that we get a deal,"" says Rebecca Patterson, chief markets strategist for J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Institutional. ""But the euphoria or the hope that we have right now, I don know if it lasts."" And that, she says, creates a trading opportunity. Looking past the Greek debt talks, the European Union is set to hold another summit at the end of January. And ""every single time, people hope going into it and they buy European assets, they get the big bang news, it's not as good as they hoped, so then they sell and they take profits on the position,"" Patterson told CNBC's Melissa Lee. ""That's what I want to do.""Patterson thinks that if the euro  rises to 1.31 against the dollar, some of the short positions in the single currency will be washed out, so she wants to wait and sell there. She would set a stop at 1.3250 and look for a move to 1.2750.But this strategy only applies if the Greeks and their creditors reach a deal, Patterson warns. ""If the Greece deal falls apart next week, ignore everything I just said and sell wherever you're at.""Todd Gordon, co-head of research and trading at Aspen Trading Group, also likes the trade. Looking at technical patterns, he says a pair of resistance levels suggest that the euro should ""roll over"" at 1.31. ",https://www.cnbc.com/2012/01/20/how-to-trade-the-greek-debt-talks.html

Davos may even be that rare place where tight security is synonymous with exclusivity. Membership fees, a well kept secret, are said to be extraordinarily high. Accommodation is precious and party lists short. If is not merely meeting of the minds, but a gathering of the masters of the universe, who are, at various times, part of a captive audience, members of a prognosticating debate club or willing participants in the operation of the global economy.

3568,"RIM Has a New CEO, But Does It Have a New Game Plan?",Tech Check,22-01-2012,"After a year marked by market share losses, a plunging stock price, and embarrassing network outages, embattled Research in Motion co-CEOs Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis have stepped down from their operating roles at the company. Still, the BlackBerry maker's new CEO, recent Chief Operating Officer Thorsten Heins, is their handpicked successor; Balsillie and Lazaridis will remain actively involved in strategy at the board level.RIM's board planned to announce the changes Monday morning, including the elevation of veteran board member Barbara Stymiest to chair, and the addition of Fairfax Financial Holdings CEO Prem Watsa to the board as its 11th member. Lazaridis will be vice chair, will head the new ""Innovation Committee,"" and will continue to be a public face of the company.It is the shuffling of Lazaridis and Balsillie, RIM's leaders for more than 20 years, into non-operating roles that's likely to command investor attention on Monday. In its release about the changes, RIM's board framed the move as an orderly succession that Balsillie and Lazaridis requested. The move does seem somewhat abrupt, though, in light of Balsillie's statement on the earnings call five weeks ago that he and Lazaridis had just reduced their cash compensation to $1 per year, and that they were in the midst of a large-scale strategic review and ""proposed transformation"" that ""could take some time.""Heins, the new CEO, told CNBC on Sunday night that he doesn't plan any sweeping strategic changes. ""This is not a turnaround company,"" he said after offering several figures showing that RIM revenues topped $5 billion last quarter, and it retains more than $1 billion in cash. ""The company at the moment isn't valued as it should be, if you look at the financials.""In other words: He remains committed to the money-losing PlayBook tablet, which he sees as merely the first step in the rollout of RIM's BlackBerry 10 platform. He won't be embracing Android. He will continue to target both the consumer and enterprise markets. Phones with BlackBerry 10 will still arrive in late 2012. And he won't be selling off key assets like RIM's proprietary network.""I truly believe \xe2\x80\x94 and the board is with me on this assessment \xe2\x80\x94 that we are very, very strongly positioned as an integrated, vertical player,"" Heins said. ""There is no plan on my side or the board's side to sell any of these important, constituting elements of our future success.""What would he say to investors who have been clamoring for a significant change in RIM's strategy? Look at BlackBerry 10, due in handsets at the end of 2012.""I would tell investors that this change already has happened on the product side, and might not be what the public was demanding. But you cannot just fall for public opinion because sometimes the Street is right, sometimes the Street is wrong. We have to do what is right for the company.""What's left, then, is how well RIM makes product deadlines and communicated to Wall Street. ""This company has to move to flawless execution, and I think this is what I can bring to the table,"" Heins said. ""A lot of frustration, frankly, is from giving dates to the market that are best intended dates and are aspirations.""Given the flurry of skeptical analyst reports that followed RIM's earnings release last month, Heins will face a tough crowd on the company's call at 8 a.m. ET Monday. Last quarter's revenue was down 6 percent year-over-year, and holiday quarter shipments were projected to be down sequentially.Want to weigh in? Leave a comment or hit me up on Twitter @jonfortt.

3571,Cramer Trades Apple Ahead of Earnings,Mad Money,23-01-2012,"On Monday, Cramer looked at how to trade Apple ahead of earnings. The technology company is scheduled to report after Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s closing bell.In doing so, the \xe2\x80\x9cMad Money\xe2\x80\x9d host considered some technical indicators. Apple\xe2\x80\x99s  stock posted a huge gain of 15 percent going into the quarter. According to Mark Sebastian, a highly regarded technician on Wall Street, Apple\xe2\x80\x99s stock has gotten hammered when it\xe2\x80\x99s had a such a huge move ahead of the quarter. In both 2010 and 2011, Sebastian found that if Apple didn\xe2\x80\x99t sell off right after earnings, it retreated to below where it was trading before the quarter. Sebastian thinks investors should sell Apple shares before it reports after the market\xe2\x80\x99s close, even if there\xe2\x80\x99s a new product introduction because Apple has a history of selling off on new product introductions, too.

3572,Yoshikami: Six Trends for 2012,The Guest Blog,23-01-2012,"With the new year we thought it might make sense to outline our major themes for 2012. Theme 1: The U.S. economy will grow at a slower pace than its historical average Comment: High debt, high unemployment, legislative gridlock, a weakening dollar, and an economy in transition as manufacturing jobs continue to flow overseas will cause the United States to grow at a slower rate. We expect overall GDP  growth to be lower than 2.5% on average for the next several years. Investment response: Selective equity investment with a focus on technology, healthcare, and certain financial service companies. U.S. equity assets with significant global revenue provide additional tailwind for earnings. Look at Oracle , Amazon , and Abbott . Theme 2: Europe will struggle Comment: Europe is essentially in the same boat as the United States but with a far more difficult state of affairs. A disjointed Europe is struggling to deal with the debt crisis and this will have lasting effects for years to come. Expect GDP growth in Europe to be slower like the United States and for Europe to enter a recession in 2012.

""We find that the NOK is one of the few commodity currencies that performs well versus the USD when oil prices rise (even if global equities sell off at the same time),"" they wrote in a note to clients.

Rigell met with Buffett for breakfast in Omaha, and the new offer came during a joint interview with Bloomberg TV.Based on Buffett's adjusted gross income of almost $63 million last year, a 15 percent donation would come to $9.4 million.Both Buffett and Rigell agree that donations are not going to play a significant role in eliminating the U.S. debt.\xc2\xa0 Buffett tells Bloomberg, ""We need policy and we need it now.\xc2\xa0 The symbolism may be important.\xc2\xa0 It certainly may shout out to the American public that we're going to ask a lot of you, so we're willing to be the first in line.""Buffett doesn't blame Mitt Romney for paying a tax rate of around 15 percent, pointing his finger at Congress instead.\xc2\xa0 ""He's not going to pay more than the law requires, and I don't fault him for that in the least.\xc2\xa0 But I do fault a law that allows him and me earning enormous sums to pay overall federal taxes at a rate that\xe2\x80\x99s about half what the average person in my office pays...

In fact, the desk was of the same view that the coffee giant is firing on all cylinders. Instead, the traders\xe2\x80\x99 negative outlook was based on the charts, which according to Carter Worth of Oppenheimer, paint a bleak picture of a stock that has come a little too far, a little too fast. To capitalize on that view, Mike Khouw bought the February 48/44 put spread for $1.05, a trade that could be worth up to $2.95 is Starbucks closes below $44 by February expiration. Earnings are Thursday, but Options Action fans have already spoken: that put spread has traded over 2700 times as of this afternoon, and there are three hours left in trading. Mike\xe2\x80\x99s trade and breakdown are below.

Options prices imply a 4% move for the event, but there appears to be little conviction on which direction. Prices for both puts and calls remain fairly even, which is unusual. Typically, puts tend to be more expensive than calls as investors look to pay-up for protection. To take at advantage of inflated call prices, riskreversal.com\xe2\x80\x99s Dan Nathan suggested collaring Apple stock by selling the February 440-strike call for $6.80, and using that money to buy the February 400-strike put for $6.80, net-net, paying nothing for a package that protects Apple below $400, but caps any upside to $440.

If teams come from wealthy areas (Read: New York & Boston), executives with corporate expense accounts could drive up prices for Joe Fan. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just about businesspeople who are fans.

As merchandise manager, he created brand name hard goods that changed the look and feel of the discount retailer. Steve Jobs would later lure Johnson to Apple , where he would develop Apple\xe2\x80\x99s retail outlets.

He will outline his vision for turning around the Plano, Texas-based retailer and its 1,000 stores or so. But Cramer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t recommend buying JCP ahead of earnings because there\xe2\x80\x99s already a lot of trigger-happy hedge funds in the stock, who are ready to sell. Retail turnarounds are too tough for a quick trade, he said.Cramer does recommend buying JCP for the long-term, though, as in holding it for the next 18 months. Despite the fact the turnaround will take a while, Cramer has a lot of confidence in Johnson. He thinks Johnson will win customers and boost sales by cutting prices. It\xe2\x80\x99s also acquiring new brands.Bottom line: To Cramer, JCP is worth owning for the next 18 months, not the next 18 minutes.Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

3700,"What\xe2\x80\x99s Up with Google, Microsoft Stock?",Mad Money,24-01-2012,"On Tuesday, Cramer tried to figure out why Google has been floundering lately while Microsoft has seemingly reinvented itself.The mystery began last Thursday when Google  reported a \xe2\x80\x9cbig earnings miss.\xe2\x80\x9d The No. 1 search engine operator, however, praised itself on the earnings conference call. CEO Larry Page called it a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong quarter,\xe2\x80\x9d but analysts on the call weren\xe2\x80\x99t buying it. As Cramer listened to the executives\xe2\x80\x99 excuses, he laughed to himself. Microsoft , on the other hand, reported strong quarterly results. Cramer noted the technology company didn\xe2\x80\x99t pat itself on the back, though.So how can we compare these two tech companies?To start, Google\xe2\x80\x99s gross margins are being hurt by the number of people using smartphones instead of personal computers, even though executives didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to admit it. That hurts because advertisers aren\xe2\x80\x99t crazy about mobile and they won\xe2\x80\x99t pay as much for mobile ads, Cramer explained. Microsoft said all of its iterations of the old Windows operating system are actually going to be having higher gross margins than last year. To Cramer, that\xe2\x80\x99s one reason Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s stock took off while Google\xe2\x80\x99s flopped.Another thing to consider is that Google has a lot of projects going, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t explain how it is going to monetize them. Microsoft is really taking advantage of its Xbox gaming system, though, and hopes to monetize Skype, which it recently acquired.After listening to both calls, Cramer thinks Microsoft can go higher, especially if Thailand returns to full production of hard drives. He wants to wait another quarter to see about Google, though.

3702,How to Dodge a Carried Interest Tax Hike ,Net Net: Promoting innovation and managing change,24-01-2012,"The revelation that Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney paid an effective tax rate of just 13.9 percent is likely to raise questions about the fairness of the tax treatment of so-called \xe2\x80\x9ccarried interest.\xe2\x80\x9dThe managers of venture capitalist funds, real estate investment funds, and private equity funds typically make a portion of their income from carried interest, which is treated as a capital gain rather than ordinary income. That means this income is taxed only at a 15 percent rate. Romney made around $13 million in carried interest in 2010 and 2011. Many have proposed changing the law to tax carried interest as ordinary income. Others say that the change would probably not accomplish much because buyout firms would simply restructure themselves to side step the tax law changes. How can they sidestep the law so easily?

3770,Fed Telling Investors \xe2\x80\x98Risk-On\xe2\x80\x99: Fast Traders,Halftime Report,25-01-2012,"Wall Street was absolutely buzzing on Wednesday after the latest Fed statement indicated that our central bank is unlikely to raise interest rates before late 2014, extending a period of record-low rates by more than a year. \xe2\x80\x9cThe rest of the statement seemed almost like a \xe2\x80\x98cut and paste job\xe2\x80\x99 from last time,\xe2\x80\x9d add the Fast Money pros. In other words the Fed again said what it has said before; \xe2\x80\x9cthe economy has been expanding moderately... the unemployment rate remains elevated... and inflation has been subdued.\xe2\x80\x9dConsidering the only big news from the statement was low rates for even longer, how should you trade?",https://www.cnbc.com/2012/01/25/fed-telling-investors-riskon-fast-traders.html
3771,Hardest Decision of All: When to Sell Apple,Options Action,26-01-2012,"Would you sell you Apple  for $445 bucks? It\xe2\x80\x99s a scenario that anyone who followed last week\xe2\x80\x99s Options Action might have to confront. As a protective measure against Apple stock, Dan Nathan of suggested using a what\xe2\x80\x99s called a cashless collar. Specifically, he suggested selling the Feb 445-strike call for $5.80 and using that money to buy the Feb 400-strike put for the same amount. The trade protects his stock below $400 but caps his upside at $445. At the time, the stock was trading at $425, and the prospect of a Google-like earnings swoon was fresh in everyone\xe2\x80\x99s mind. Now, however, Apple\xe2\x80\x99s the most valuable company in the world, and as CNBC\xe2\x80\x99s Capital Markets Editor Gary Kaminsky points out, \xe2\x80\x9cnot owning Apple is like being short the market.\xe2\x80\x9d So what to do now? The first choice is easy. Stay long the put, says Nathan. \xe2\x80\x9cYou might as well keep it on. It\xe2\x80\x99s not worth much at this point.\xe2\x80\x9d But the call part of the trade gets tricky. You could cover it today for about a $9.50 loss. But remember, this is a strategy that is used in conjunction with a long position, so with the stock\xe2\x80\x99s $24 gain since earnings, you\xe2\x80\x99re basically still up $14.50 ($24.00 gain on stock - $9.50 loss on options trade) if close it out now. But if the stock settles in here, and options prices begin to naturally decay, you will be able to buy back that call at a cheaper price than current levels. Ideally, you want the stock to be just below that $445 level by February, at which point the whole package would expire worthless.So what\xe2\x80\x99s Dan doing? \xe2\x80\x9cIf you own the stock and you think there is more upside before February, you may want to cover the call. Remember, these collars should be used tactically, when you are more concerned about downside than upside,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nathan.

Kinder Morgan has roughly 38,000 miles of pipe for oil and natural gas, as well as about 185 terminals that handle coal and the like. Cramer has long liked this stock, though, because it pays a juicy dividend yield. KMP currently boasts a yield of 5.6 percent.Cramer wanted to catch up with company\xe2\x80\x99s CEO Rich Kinder.

3775,"In Videogames, Even Football Isn't Without Controversy",Tech,25-01-2012,"While football is a pretty family-friendly sport, it's not always benign in the videogame world. The NFL has been a part of the landscape for about as long as videogames have been around \xe2\x80\x94 and anything with such longevity tends to ruffle some feathers among both players and publishers. The controversies are often economic or deal with the creative evolutions of the genre \xe2\x80\x94 and can't hold a candle to gaming's most infamous moments. But when you're talking about a subgenre where a single game franchise \xe2\x80\x94 ""Madden"" \xe2\x80\x94 is responsible for more than $3 billion in sales, those issues can have a big impact on a company's bottom line.No company knows the importance of football more than Electronic Arts. In 2004, the company saw the ""Madden"" franchise under assault like never before. Take-Two Interactive Software, tired of being the perennial also-ran in football games, tried a bold strategy to boost awareness. Rather than pricing its ""NFL2K"" game at $50, like most sports titles cost at the time, it offered the game for $20.The strategy worked. Fans, many of whom had criticized ""Madden"" for failing to offer significant innovations each year, tested out the competing game and liked it. EA tried to hold the line on its premium pricing, but was forced to lower Madden to $20 within months, causing its quarterly numbers to suffer. On a conference call at the time, company officials vowed to take all necessary steps to protect the ""Madden"" franchise. They weren't kidding. In December 2004, EA and the NFL announced an exclusivity deal that would prevent Take-Two (and other game publishers) from using NFL team or player names. The agreement proved to be a master stroke (from a corporate standpoint). By taking the NFL away from the competition, EA essentially gained control of the market. ""Certainly, many versions of \xe2\x80\x98NFL2K\xe2\x80\x99 were really good football games,"" says Billy Pidgeon, senior analyst at M2 Research. ""[The franchise] was, in some cases, possibly better than \xe2\x80\x98Madden.\xe2\x80\x99 But EA having the official license made it difficult for anyone to compete \xe2\x80\x93 even with a better game.""Many fans, to this day, argue that both \xe2\x80\x9cMadden\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cNFL2K\xe2\x80\x9d would still be slugging it out for supremacy in the virtual gridiron. But analysts aren't so sure. As sports games have been surpassed in popularity by shooters, there's debate about whether the titles could have co-existed. ""The data I see doesn't support the notion,"" says Colin Sebastian, senior research analyst at R.W. Baird. ""EA may have stifled innovation, but I don't think we would have had two football games each selling 10 million units each year.""Take-Two for its part tried to stay in the game, recruiting star NFL athletes of years gone by (and licensing their images) as its hook. That kept the \xe2\x80\x9cNFL2K\xe2\x80\x9d series on life support, but when the company added O.J. Simpson to the mix in 2007, gamers were outraged. And since the company couldn't tie Simpson to the Buffalo Bills, it had to create a fictitious team. For some reason, it chose to include the man who had been accused of stabbing to death his ex-wife on ""The Assassins,"" whose mascot made stabbing motions when the team scored. The off-field activities of some players have come back to haunt EA as well. The selection of each year's cover athlete for the \xe2\x80\x9cMadden\xe2\x80\x9d games has become a spectator sport for football fans. And in this age of social media, the company decided to let the fans vote for the 2012 edition. Among the candidate was Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Michael Vick, who had fronted the game in 2004. Since that appearance, Vick had been convicted of taking part in a dog-fighting ring and served 21 months in prison (along with two months of home confinement).While the NFL welcomed him back, many fans remain outraged at his actions \xe2\x80\x93 so when Vick made it to the semifinals in the vote for the cover position, then the finals, many were upset \xe2\x80\x93 even though it was a fan vote. In the end, Cleveland's Peyton Hillis got the cover spot. But many wondered whether Vick's advancement came through actual fan votes or if it was a publicity stunt by the company in a year where the game was in danger of being overshadowed by a potential NFL strike. ""I would not be surprised if they were being controversial to make the news and punch it up,"" says Pidgeon.

3778,Commentary: Demanding a New Breed of Leadership,Davos WEF,25-01-2012,"The World Economic Forum \\(WEF\\), convening this week in Davos, recognizes that our globalized world demands a new style of leadership. The old, hierarchical command-and-control approach is increasingly outdated. Instead, the ability to seek out diverse viewpoints and identify blind spots has become essential.Today\xe2\x80\x99s inclusive leaders know that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have all the answers. They\xe2\x80\x99re interested in and engage with diverse stakeholders across multiple borders. Recent Ernst & Young research,The World is Bumpy: globalization and the new strategies for growth, highlights this leadership shift with two-thirds of the 1,000 executive respondents saying that they will increase the number of external partners with whom they work over the next three years. To lead by example, the WEF has committed to more diversity among attendees and presenters, including a new mandate, instituted last year, which requires the Forum\xe2\x80\x99s 100 strategic partners to bring at least one female executive among the five delegates they send to Davos. It\xe2\x80\x99s a work in progress but, more than ever, they understand that diverse perspectives matter when trying to improve the state of the world. Underpinning the need for a new style of leadership are the demographic shifts that represent one of the most powerful forces in the world. The makeup of our global workforce is changing across multiple dimensions and the leaders of tomorrow will come from the under-represented demographics of today.

3780,CEO Blog: Getting America Back to Work Begins In Our Schools,The Guest Blog,25-01-2012,"In his State of the Union addresslast night President Obama reminded the nation that education equals employment. In the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s box sat a single mother from North Carolina whose studies at a community college earned her a high-tech position after she had lost a job as a mechanic. The President wants states to require students to stay in high school until they graduate or turn 18. Given the global economic challenges we confront it is essential we provide every American with the opportunity for a quality education. But that is not possible if our educational infrastructure is in disrepair. Last September the President proposed spending $30 billion dollars as part of his American Jobs Act to modernize and upgrade schools and community colleges. The President should not retreat from this important proposal. Not only would it be a valuable investment in our children, but it also would quickly create more high-paying jobs here in the United States. As president of JE Dunn Construction, a construction company that is a national top 10 builder of educational facilities, I have seen first-hand the need for major renovation in outdated school facilities. We are already working on updating many educational facilities around the country, and there are many more badly in need of repair and renovation to improve the learning environment for our children. Inner-city schools averaging 60-70 years in age too often have poor heating and inadequate lighting. A child cannot learn well if he is shivering in his classroom while squinting to read his textbook. Other schools have no air conditioning even though the school year in some districts starts during the heat of the summer or extends through the summer. Buildings built for baby boomers are energy inefficient, which causes higher operating and maintenance costs over time. Schools also need state-of-the-art technology to teach students for the 21st century high-tech world. Sustainable building practices need to be utilized in renovations, additions and new construction. Parents and students are becoming educated on the energy, environmental, and cost benefits at the local and global levels. The saving in energy provides a payback for the improvements and more. We are seeing many educational facilities convert to green building practices systems. That\xe2\x80\x99s responsible spending that pays off in the long run because of the decrease in energy costs. Though I am a fiscal conservative who wants a balanced federal budget, I recognize the need for spending on essential projects now so I encourage Congress to support President Obama's proposed investment in education. The bill would provide a one-time stimulus for our national education infrastructure at a time when it is desperately needed.

3788,Ways to Win In This Market,Mad Money,25-01-2012,"There are so many ways to win in this market, Cramer said Wednesday. The \xe2\x80\x9cMad Money\xe2\x80\x9d host detailed a few of the many winning trades today.First, consider hostile takeover bids. On Tuesday, pharmaceutical company Roche made a bid for Illumina, an underperforming diagnostic company. In turn, Illumina\xe2\x80\x99s stock finished well above the price Roche had started bidding at.Second, there\xe2\x80\x99s the reversal trade. One of the most annoying aspects of the market last year was if the market opened down, it would continue to fall into the close, Cramer said. If it was up, it only stayed up long enough to sucker you in before killing you. The optimal situation is when the market opened down, you could take advantage of the decline and make money on a rebound. That hadn\xe2\x80\x99t happened in a while, though, until Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s market. Third, Cramer pointed to the \xe2\x80\x9cshrug off.\xe2\x80\x9d Giant downgrades of both Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs by JPMorgan Chase Wednesday didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to bother the market as much as it had last year, he explained. Anyone who bought Goldman down at $105 was able to ride it back up to $108.\xe2\x80\x9cFaux earnings disappointments\xe2\x80\x9d were also at work, Cramer said, like how Boeing disappointed because of pension costs. He shrugged it off, though, and the stock bounced back.Finally, Apple is the most obvious winning trade. A lot has been said about the technology company\xe2\x80\x99s stock, but Cramer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think it has run too much. He\xe2\x80\x99s hoping it retreats, though, so investors can buy more. To Cramer, the Apple narrative is remarkable. A short while ago, nobody knew what to do with the iPad. Now the device has revolutionized so many aspects of people\xe2\x80\x99s lives.\xc2\xa0 Despite tablet glut having hindered business earlier, Apple has wiped out the competition. It\xe2\x80\x99s sold more than 15 million iPads in a single quarter, which is double last year\xe2\x80\x99s numbers. Apple also sold 37 million iPhones last quarter. The iPhone 4s device is helped by the SIri service, an automated personal assistant that helps organize your life by providing directions, setting reminders, booking appointments and many other things.Cramer said the way to win with Apple, then, is to continue owning shares.When this story was published, Cramer's charitable trust owned Apple.Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCQuestions for Cramer?

3801,Playing Field Shifting for Football Video Game Industry ,Tech,25-01-2012,"Long before ""Call of Duty"" was dominating the video-game sales charts, there was football. Though shooters might be the hottest games around these days, sports games are still big sellers \xe2\x80\x94 and the virtual gridiron is a perennial favorite. And, more importantly to console makers, it's a genre that helps sales. ""Football is considered a system seller,"" says Billy Pidgeon, senior analyst at M2 Research. ""There is a type of gamer that plays primarily sports \xe2\x80\x94 if not only sports. When a new version of 'Madden' comes out, that customer is more likely to buy a new console. It gets some fence sitters to pick up a new system \xe2\x80\x94 and that can work whether we're at the beginning of the cycle, the middle or the end."" When it comes to video-game football, of course, there's no franchise bigger than ""Madden,"" which has thus far earned more than $3 billion for Electronic Arts. Of course, to be fair, there really isn't any game other than ""Madden"" when it comes to football on the major consoles. EA sewed up the exclusive video-game rights to the NFL and its Player's Association in late 2004, effectively sacking competitors. It was an expensive partnership to strike, but one that has paid off. ""Madden 2012,"" the most recent installment, shipped over 3 million units in the company's fiscal second quarter \xe2\x80\x94 an equal amount to the previous year, despite a shorter shipping window, due to a change in the game's release date. When EA and the NFL first struck their deal, though, gamers were aghast. Take-Two Interactive Software had made sales inroads on ""Madden"" that year, and many players felt it was the superior title. By granting EA sole license to the NFL, they worried creativity would suffer. Whether those warnings proved true is still a matter of debate in Internet chat rooms, but analysts note that the rise of games like Activision's  ""Modern Warfare"" may have forced game publishers to accept a winner-take-all playing field. ""'Madden' football, at one point, was the killer app for video game consoles,"" says Colin Sebastian, senior research analyst at R.W. Baird. ""[But] what we're finding in the sports genre [today] is there might not be enough room for two profitable large scale franchises. Take-Two has run away with the NBA and EA owns football. The only exception would be soccer, where there is some viable competition \xe2\x80\x94 which is understandable, given how globally popular that sport is."" While football may not be topping the sales charts like it once was, it's hardly in danger of becoming irrelevant. It's not bulletproof, though. The sports genre is still driving console sales but is no longer growing at a rapid clip. In other words, football games are not significantly expanding the gaming audience and the sport has yet to make a smooth transition to areas where the industry is expanding quickly. Take the mobile platform, for example. EA's Madden app for Apple's iOS systems tops the sales charts for a brief period upon its release, but never as long as its console cousin. And reviews of the app have been spotty. The mobile space is the one area where EA doesn't hold an NFL monopoly. Other developers, such as Gameloft and Full Fat Games feature NFL teams and stadiums. The problem, for now, is that mobile games don\xe2\x80\x99t have the blockbuster earning potential of console. ""If I were going to compete with 'Madden' on any level, it would be easier and less costly to do so on an iOS platform,"" says Pidgeon. ""But I don't think you could sell on the same level [as consoles]."" That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like a win-win situation.

3802,What the FOMC Meeting Could Mean for the Dollar,Money in Motion,25-01-2012,"When Federal Reserve officials offer a peek into their interest rate plans, it could mean tough sledding for the dollar.Wondering about the currency effect of the Federal Reserve's new openness on interest-rate plans, on display for the first time today? Steven Englander, global head of G10 FX strategy at Citigroup, is of two minds.""In the long and medium term this is all second order,"" he wrote in a note to clients. But in the short term, it's more complicated, he says. Investors will want to know what the meaning of ""extended"" is when Fed officials talk about keeping rates low for an extended period. If they conclude that means 2015 or 2016, it could hurt sentiment.Such a shift would be more important than you might think, Englander says. ""Our positioning indicators show the short EUR  position mainly against USD rather than on the crosses,"" he says, and the only long positions they see are in the dollar.  That means the greenback is vulnerable. Also, Englander says, ""investors have discussed the EUR to death, but have been giving the USD an easy ride."" If they start to worry, ""the USD could be in for a rough ride in the immediate aftermath of FOMC, even if the long-term implications are limited.""The fun should start this afternoon with the release of the FOMC statement.Tune In: CNBC's ""Money in Motion Currency Trading"" airs on Fridays at 5:30pm and repeats on Saturdays at 7pm.

Particularly at a time of high unemployment and economic divides, the public has little to no patience for companies that try to talk their way out of a mess before taking real action.
